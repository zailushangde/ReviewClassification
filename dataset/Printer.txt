I purchased the printer at Staples for 199.00, but returned my 'old' one and received a 50.00 rebate, so my net cost was 149.00 for this product. I found the 3" LCD very easy to read and also very user friendly, as it takes you step by step while installing the printer to your network for the first time. It took about 30 minutes from out of the box, to fully function properly. I was torn between purchasing a laser vs an ink jet, but determined my needs were better suited for an inkjet and I was pleasantly surprised on the quality of the pictures I created via the printer. The colors were amazing! I will upload a sample shortly. I found the wireless connection which allows me to print wirelessly without having to connect using a cable from the computer was awesome, as my wife usually works on her laptop, and this is great feature! The Canon MX882 operates with five ink cartridges; so when one specific color runs out, you just need to replace that one cartridge and not the entire array. I also noticed Canon installs easily to reach 'shortcuts' on your pc to easily manage your function for your printer. The scanner worked well, as I was quikly able to scan an old 4x6 photo and upload it to my pc for easy sharing. You can also scan to e-mail as it will open up your e-mail and attach a scan to a new message. In a nutshell, very, very user friendly and the quality of the prints were great.;;5.0;;March 7, 2011;;287;;294;;0.97619
R26FHIGUYW4O6W;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AL04YYG2IVV5I;;Printer;;B00450DVDY;;Brother HL-2270DW Compact Laser Printer with Wireless Networking and Duplex;;Very good printer -- a hassle to set up for Mac users;;After going through another $56 set of inks on my inkjet printer, I decided enough is enough. I don't need to print documents in color and I no longer print photos at home because Costco and Walmart are cheap and easy (and better). This Brother laser printer was my solution.<br /><br />I give the printer high marks: the print quality can be set at three different levels and the two highest levels are superb. Also it duplex prints (both sides) and does a good job at that. Printing envelopes via the 'straight-through' path is easy and has made my label machine less useful.<br /><br />As with so many tech units, it's the setup that is the hassle. I am a Mac person. Sure, I've used PCs at work and when I have to but I much prefer the Mac OS. The first indication that there was trouble was when the included setup disk refused to install the printer drivers because they were outdated. There was no link to update, no advice, nothing. So I went to the Brother site and after digging around through their horrible UI, I found the necessary updated drivers, downloaded and installed them. But that was only the start of the hassle.<br /><br />The user manual is horribly confusing, to say the least, when it comes to setting up the wireless networking (at least to me). I suggest you ignore everything in the manual regarding networking. Let me give you Mac users some hints so you can avoid the wasted time and frustration I experienced:<br /><br />1. After you've unpacked the printer, installed the toner and paper and printed a test page, go to the Apple web site and search for Brother printer drivers. Apple has all the latest drivers for download free.<br />2. Download and install the drivers.<br />3. Insert the CD that came with the printer and open the 'Utilities' folder. Do NOT use the 'Start Here OSX' icon.<br />4. In the Utilities folder, click on 'Wireless Device Setup Wizard.'<br />5. In the next box, Setting Up Wireless, click 'NO' then 'Next.'<br />6. In the next box, click 'checked and confirmed' then 'Next' (you don't need to read the stuff in that box).<br />7. In the next box, make sure 'Temporarily use USB cable' is selected, then click 'Next.'<br />8. Connect a USB cable from your computer to the printer.<br />9. In the next box, you will see the setup software searching for wireless signals in your area. Make sure your network is visible, then select it.<br />10. In the next box, input your router's wireless access password twice as requested. (Note: if you have an Apple Airport, do not enter the Airport PW, but your wireless access PW)<br />11. Unplug the USB cable to the printer.<br />12. Click through to 'finish' and you are done!<br /><br />Your Brother is now set up to print wirelessly and you can put it anywhere you like.<br /><br />If Brother would make the setup 'Apple' easy I would give this printer 5 stars. It's a 5-star printer, but a zero-star setup experience.;;4.0;;September 13, 2012;;12;;13;;0.923077
R1HQ80VFLWO7S9;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A36MD4KAVIPLB2;;Printer;;B005GSYNRM;;Epson Stylus NX430 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner (C11CB22201);;Solid All-in-one Inkjet;;Overall, the Epson NX430 is a solid all-in-one printer.  At a retail price of $99, it may not be worth it but if you can catch a sale like I did and get it for $49 it is well worth the price.  Appearance wise the finish is a black that is glossy, but has some texture to it so it doesn't get all marked up with fingerprints too bad.  The front has a fold up LCD screen with several virtual buttons that looks like something you would find a more pricy unit.  When not in use, everything folds up nice and compact.<br /><br />Setup<br />--------<br />Setup could not be easier for the NX430.  Using the supplied disc and a user supplied USB cable; it took 10 minutes start to finish.  The disc runs you through the setup procedure, clearly stating exactly what to do so anyone should be able to install this.  It also prompts you to register, pulling in the serial number as well as updating the firmware for the printer.  Definitely one of the easiest printer setups I've ever seen.  Just make sure you know your wireless network SSID and password and it should run flawlessly.<br /><br />Features and Performance<br />---------------------------<br />I'm sure a big draw to this printer is the wireless, and I can say it works great.  Once a job is sent to the printer, it starts almost immediately just as though it was plugged in.  It has good range for the wireless as well.  Scanning wirelessly takes a little more effort as you have to open the scan software Epson installs - this program is very simple and basic but works great.  A drawback is you cannot initiate a scan at the unit itself wirelessly but you have to insert the item to be scanned then initiate it at the computer via the scan software.  If connected via USB, you can initiate the scan at the printer itself.  Scan quality is decent, not perfect but I'm sure good enough for almost all users. This unit also has a method to print by sending an email or from a tablet or phone.  I have not used this, but at setup you are prompted to setup an account and it looks to be a very simple process.<br /><br />Printing also works very well.  The paper tray is in the back which is nice so there is no tray sticking out.  I have had no issues with it not pulling paper in - just make sure the paper is straight and the guide is adjusted correctly to prevent the paper from being pulled in crooked.  So far everything I have printed has come out nice and clear, and this has consisted of mostly text documents and coupons with a few color images thrown in.  The one picture I printed seems to be of decent quality, obviously not as good as a photo printer but not bad for an all-in-one.  I never recommend printing pictures on an all-in-one for reasons of quality and the ink it will suck.  It's so easy to head to Walgreens or other places to print photos these days and is much more economical with higher quality.  Copies scanned and printed the document quickly as well on the NX430.  Speed-wise this isn't the fastest unit, but it's not bad and should be just fine for most users.<br /><br />I was actually surprised at how well the LCD display and virtual buttons worked.  The display is nice and clear and the buttons are responsive.  The menu structure is well laid out and for a given screen, only the usable buttons are illuminated.  If you ever get in a menu and don't know where you are, there is a back button and a home button so you can just start over.  I haven't printed via a SD card yet, but I popped one in just to see how it would work and it looks to be simple enough, displaying the pictures on the screen.<br /><br />The ink usage for the NX430 doesn't seem to be any better or worse than other printers I've used.  Of course the first cartridge isn't going to last long - it is the smaller size and on startup this printer "Primes" the ink system, which takes much of the ink from the startup cartridges.  It is nice having 4 instead of 2 so you don't waste a color cartridge by having to replace it when one color is gone but others may be almost full.  The cartridges are very easy to remove and install.  Pricewise the cost is also comparable to others and about the same everywhere.  Occasionally you can find a deal through Epson with free shipping or a good sale at Target, and I recommend stocking up at this time.  Get the 126's, not the 124's as these contain much more ink, will last longer and are a better value.<br /><br />Recommendation<br />----------------<br />Overall the Epson NX430 is a nice all-in-one printer that I can recommend.  I have had zero issues so far, and the ink usage doesn't seem to be any worse than other inkjets.  I am giving it 4 stars because at the normal price of $79 - $99 with a few quirks that may be a bit much, but if you catch a sale and get it for $49 - $59 like I did, then I would give it a 5 and a great value.;;4.0;;April 16, 2012;;7;;7;;1.0

It did a nice job printing, but I realized it sucked up the ink like a vacuum.  Ok I just was careful about how much stuff I printed.  I recently had to replace a cartridge (just one mind you) so I did.  The printer told me the same cartridge replaced was still out of ink. Since there were two black cartridges, I bought another - still no go.  Now it is telling me the yellow is out too - I replaced ALL the color cartridges too - still the same result.  I have gone thru all the standard troubleshooting, cleaning of printheads and everything else I can think of.<br /><br />This thing is a piece of junk and it makes me sick that I not only wasted money on the printer, but on several brand new cartridges in an effort to make it work. This thing lasted less than 3 months from the time I walked out of the store til it crapped out on me. I would avoid this printer like the plague.;;1.0;;May 19, 2009;;38;;41;;0.926829

After a few attempts on both machines we went to Canon's official site and downloaded the specific drivers/software for x64  Win 7. They downloaded quickly and without fuss. We would've saved a little time by skipping trying to load the disk and just getting the OS specific downloads from Canon's site.

Current King of Innovation and Ease of Use. Tablet is Functional, Not Flashy;;I've recently been a user of mostly Epson all-in-one printers, but ours is a very high-tech household and we found Epson's design to be a bit long in the tooth. We have several computers, iPhones, an iPad 2 that we wanted to be able to print from, we dropped our (expensive, seldom used) landline long ago in favor of cellular-only phones and we struggled to find a printer that fits our lifestyle.<br /><br />Most of them don't have DIRECT support of iOS devices (some have apps that work so-so), they all seem based around the idea that you have a landline if you want to fax anything, and the user interface for setting things up and accessing print functions is often hard to use. Sometimes you're even lucky if your printer installs on the latest hardware and operating systems! Luckily, the eStation blows the competition out of the water in all those areas.<br /><br />First, as always, is installation, which is BY FAR the easiest of any printer I've setup. The tablet makes for beautiful, easy data entry and instruction. Picking timezones, choosing networks and entering in network passwords is all as easy as possible thanks to the tablet's gesture support and virtual keyboard. Competing printers like my released-this-year Epson touch-screen printer didn't even have a virtual keyboard! Setting up the web-services (e.g. getting an email address for the printer) was simple, too. I didn't even have to read a manual, I just ran through intuitive setup screens and, because you have a tablet, there's even instructional videos to walk you through the processes if you get stuck.<br /><br />Installing drivers on my computers was equally painless. When installing my other Epson printer, I was nagged by 20 security dialogs on Windows 7 64-bit and had to make a tech support call to even setup scanning from my Mac! By contrast the eStation setup was a dream. The Mac interface is smooth and clean with no errors or hiccups while the Windows setup screens were not quite as refined as on Mac but without the security prompt dialogs found in the Epson setup.<br /><br />What about my iPhones and iPad 2, you ask? No setup required! They were able to locate the printer via AirPrint instantly and print emails, documents and web pages without issue, even given the option to use double-sided printing if desired! You simply have to push the same button you'd use to email the content and there's a "Print" option at the bottom that finds the eStation as long as it's connected to the same network.<br /><br />You also have the ability to have the printer receive an email from a (long, convoluted) email address assigned to it by HP's ePrint services. It works perfectly and can even be done remotely, say if I had to print out a form for my wife to fill out while I was at work! The eStation simply prints the email you send and/or prints the attachments you send with the email. It's brilliant!<br /><br />The eFax feature is one of my favorites, too! Like I said, we're among the 20% and growing that have only cellular service with no landline. Thus, the ability to fax directly over the internet is very welcome, indeed, espcially when you get 20 faxes for free each month! Before I owned the eStation, we'd use our old printer to scan documents to the computer, then use a service we paid $80/year for to fax them. The eStation will completely eliminate that expense and eliminate a step in the process by faxing directly from the printer (instead of scanning to computer, then faxing).<br /><br />Unfortunately, faxing (and scanning) isn't perfect since it appears like you have to scan one sheet at a time as there is no document feeder. That came as a surprise to me, however, given the fact we almost always send 1-page faxes, I'm okay with the limitation. I can see where the 1-page at a time limitation will become an infrequent annoyance with scanning, but it's forgiveale given the printers other strengths.<br /><br />Lastly, it's worth mentioning the included Android tablet. As I mentioned previously, I have an iPad 2, and the answer to the question of if the eStation "Zeen" tablet stacks up to standalone tablets, the answer is a resounding "No". The tablet is slow, heavy, and not great as tablets go. It's of absolutely no suprise however, and shouldn't be counted against this amazing printer/tablet combo. Look at it this way: as of the time of this writing, the cheapest iPad 2 is $499, the somewhat similarly capable HP Envy 100 printer sells for $250 on Amazon, while the eStation sells for $300. Certainly a printer/tablet combo won't stack up against a more expensive standalone tablet and if the question is whether or not it's worth the extra $50 over another printer for eFax services and a 7-inch wireless Android tablet the answer is abso-freakin-lutely.<br /><br />The tablet makes for a great control panel, with video and easy-to-enter text, it provides an easy touch-interface for faxing, scanning, copying, etc., it displays weather widgets and other items if you choose, it browses the web and prints web pages directly and it can even play Angry Birds and other games you can download from Amazon's Android Appstore! My kids even use the included apps to look up and print coloring sheets of Disney characters! Not a bad value if you ask me.<br /><br />In short, HP hit it out of the park with this printer, which stands as a perfect example of innovation within the market segment. AirPrint for iOS, ePrint, eFax are all huge selling points, usability is better than any printer I've used and the 7" table is icing on the cake! It even comes with an enclosed paper tray to keep my kids out of printer paper! The main drawback is the lack of document feeder, which may make heavy faxers and scanners frustrated. Despite that limitation, however, the eStation is easily the best printer on the market, in my mind.<br /><br />Oh, and one last thing worth a mention: the whole printer comes wrapped in a pretty nice, large reusable HP-branded grocery bag. Sweet!;;4.0;;March 18, 2011;;14;;14;;1.0

There is a pattern on the Brother website that prints out a solid block of each color. The banding is evident on all colors but and the pattern of banding is similar but not identical on all colors.

The driver does not warn you when the ink cartridge will be automatically switched, which wastes about $5-10 each time if the switch isn't intended.  And the driver doesn't save the paper type and black ink type from print to print, even with custom print settings.  So you will inevitably have accidental ink swaps. They acknowledge it's a flaw, but refuse to do anything about it, even though the very same issue was addressed in two of their more expensive printers.  There needs to be an option to disable auto switching or at least a dialog that pops up to confirm the switch.  Really bad flaw on an otherwise wonderful printer.

Tired of the expense of the ink and the bulk of the device.  I've got a small scanner on my desk now to cover scanning and most copying.  Who needs a fax these days.  Got the Brother home, unpacked, plugged in and less than 30 minutes later was printing from every computer in the house including my PC, a windows laptop, my wife's Mac and my iPad.

Some curl, but quickly relaxes and no other issues as had been described for previous versions.  The auxiliary feed is on the front, which makes my life easier at least as the printer is tucked away under my desk.

It comes with a 3' USB cable and you just connect it to the PC and a dialog box asks which type of install you would like to perform (wired network, direct USB connection, or wireless).  I did the wireless connection- so I had to enter in the password for the printer to get on which is all configured through the PC. Overall, the total install and setup took about 10 minutes.<br /><br />I did change the amount of time for the printer to enter the sleep mode.  The default was 15 minutes and I changed it to 5 since I don't print as often.  You change this by right clicking on the printer and going to the properties menu on your PC.<br /><br />For printing, the text is very clear.  Images are pretty good as well.  I printed directions and maps and from google and everything looked clear.  I love how fast the printer is.  Even when the printer is in sleep mode, it starts printing in less than 10 seconds.<br /><br />I scanned one file so far to test it out.  I performed the scan wirelessly which is a nice feature.

The much-vaunted long lasting ink is a lie; I've been using this printer for a few months and it eats ink like candy.  The scanning function has stopped working - fortunately it's under warranty but I'd junk it if I could afford to.  The print copy is bad -- sometimes the printing skips; I do a lot of printing in draft mode and at this setting the printing is wavy!  One important function I must have in a printer is the ability is to scan to e-mail; the description says this one will--they forgot to mention that that function only works if you are attached to a network which I'm not.  This is a sorry excuse for a printer.  I am so sorry I did not buy another Canon.  I resent that I had to give it one star--it should be none.  Update 7/23/2912:  I've had it less than a year--so far Kodak has sent me two new printheads and now there's an error message that says I have a paper jam -- I don't -- can't get it corrected.

In fact, I have already used the first package of 10 sheets of Zink (Zero Ink) paper that come with the printer. So my first recommendation is; if you are planning on buying a PoGo, I highly recommend getting extra paper so you can get through your "testing" phase without having to purchase more paper. However, don't go crazy and buy too much, there are expiration dates on the paper which may affect your picture quality if you take to long to "expose" (print) them.<br /><br />Connectivity:<br />I have tested the Bluetooth capabilities with my Motorola Q, Laptop Computer (Bluetooth enabled), my desk-top Windows Vista computer (with Radio Shack "Bluespoon" Bluetooth 2.0 adaptor added) and my PictBridge capable Canon Powershot A 640 camera (directly connected to PoGo via USB cable) and the printer worked like a charm in all of the above tests!<br /><br />Speed of Printing:<br />Print time is about 1 minute per photo. There was no noticeable change in print speed with any of the tests I performed. Using the Bluetooth (wireless) connection or plugging in your USB cable directly from your camera did not seem to make any difference as to how fast the image printed.<br /><br />Image Quality:<br />Not great...but not the worst I have seen either...The pictures I printed from my camera (via USB connection) looked better than my pictures from my cell phone, but this was likely due to the higher megapixel image created by my camera versus the 1 megapixel image from my cell phone. However, the "white balance" of both my camera and cell phone images were a little "off". The whites were extremely white (almost washed-out) and the dark (shadow areas) were very dark. So if you stay away from printing bright "beach / snow" images or dark "night" photographs you will be OK. Photos with lots of color (flowers, for example) looked pretty good when printed with the PoGo.<br /><br />Cool things to do:<br />The adhesive on the back of the photo paper is a nice feature of this product. This makes it possible to add pictures to your hand written journals. You can stick them to business card magnets and put photos all over your refrigerator. You can make photo luggage tags, cards and much, much more.<br /><br />If you don't need the highest quality image, but want to do some fun, creative stuff with photographs I would definitely recommend the PoGo. If you are a photographer hoping that the PoGo would give you a quick "proof" of what your printed images will look like, then this printer is probably not for you, since the image quality is not as good as you could get with some standard ink jet printers.<br /><br />Have fun...;;4.0;;September 21, 2008;;345;;347;;0.994236

After completion of installation of the software, ink, etc., the printer went into what seemed like an extended cleaning mode.  After printing one 7x5 image, the printed showed the photo black ink approximately one-quarter left.  The rest of the ink levels had dropped to almost one-half level.  Two days later, I turned on the printer and the printer seemed to kick into another cleaning cycle, and an extended one at that!  After the printer was in the cleaning cycle for approximately four minutes, I noticed the printer icon bouncing in the dock at the bottom of the computer screen.  When I opened the software, it showed me that the photo black ink was completely consumed and the printer wanted it replaced.  I replaced the photo black ink and after approximately two more minutes of printer moving the head left and right, I was able to print.  After printing a grand total of eight 7x5 images, the rest of the inks were totally out!  At this point, I made arrangements to have the printer replaced.  Well, I got the new printer and unfortunately, it has behaved the same as the first one.  The only difference being that all of the inks went down almost even as opposed to the photo black ink going down first.  After a total of two print sessions, all of the inks were consumed by the printer.  For the whole set of inks, I managed to print ONLY TWO 2.5 inch x 1.4 inch size images!  Actually, I had to replace the light light black ink along the way.  I searched the internet and found no complaints with this device.  I have no idea what is going on.  All I can say is that this is not the case of user error as I have been using inkjet printers for a while (Canon S800, Epson 1270, Epson 2200, and Epson 2400).;;1.0;;July 26, 2008;;112;;119;;0.941176

I don't have school-aged kids and I do most of my printing at work. So I used the printer sparingly. I learned that when I did need it, the ink would dry up! And a full set of HP 940 cartridges costs around $85! Shame on you HP! I read somewhere that the inkjet printer fluid is the most expensive substance in the world per ounce. It is even more expensive than gold! I tried researching on ways I can refill the cartridges but I didn't find a good or reliable way. I decided that I was done being gouged by HP for the cartridges so I researched on the internet and it seems like the cheapest way to go was to just get your picture prints from various local or online stores and then print your home stuff on a laser printer.<br /><br />I then tried to research on wireless laser printers. I know that HP being HP, it would still try to gouge me on the toners and in fact, the toner for this printer is expensive. So I decided that one of my criteria for my new printer is that I'm either able to find an easy way to refill the toner or find a good third party compatible toner. And guess what, there are 4.5 star rated third party toners in Amazon for this specific printer. A two-pack costs around twenty bucks. TWO TONERS FOR 20 BUCKS! I was also looking at an entry-level Brother wifi enabled laser printer. That one had automatic duplexing and I actually liked it better but it did not have a highly rated toner from a third party. Isn't it sad though that the main criteria I had to use was a availability of refills or a non-branded toner?<br /><br />I purchased 1102w and was pleasantly surprised about its small footprint. I wasn't thinking about it when I first bought the printer but I realized that this unit also is compatible with Apple's Air Print. Sadly, the latest firmware was not installed so I had to download a firmware update utility from HP. And I had to delete the printer as a wireless printer and add it again as a wired printer because I read online that you can not update the firmware wirelessly. But after updating the firmware, I was able to print from my iOS devices. This is a nice bonus.<br /><br />We are an Apple household and I knew from other reviews that HP didn't document wireless printing (on OS X) very well. Fortunately, I just followed the steps outlined in the October 30, 2010 Amazon review by  R. Ruiz "Bohemian Bon Vivant" and I was able to set-up wireless printing in OS X Snow Leopard in no time. I am not sure if this will work for OS X Lion.<br /><br />Overall, the HP 1102w is an inexpensive wireless printer that has excellent (and and cheap) third-party toners available.;;5.0;;December 28, 2011;;9;;9;;1.0

I've had great results. The color printing is somewhat slow, but grayscale printing is much faster that any inkjet I've owned. So far, wireless printing has been as trouble-free as it was with my HP inkjet printer. As I mentioned, this printer was recommended to me by a friend who has had it for quite a while and has been very happy with it. After doing a fair amount of research on color laser printers, I have to say that this one offered the best value for the money over all others that I found. I'm very happy with the purchase which, by the way, arrived only two days after I bought it.<br /><br />Update: The print quality of this printer has slowly diminished over the year that I've had it. The colors are not printing out as vividly as they did originally and it is currently being repaired under warranty. The repair service said that they were able to improve the quality, but that it was not returned to an optimum state. Samsung has said that they will replace it if I am not getting high quality printouts after the repairs are made.

This turned out to be a huge win for us, since even though the printer is poor quality it really is charming for what it is able to do. After we were done with the wedding, we had several pages left in our book and my wife and I occupied ourselves by filling in the blank pages by taking fun pictures of us and making a travelogue of our adventures.<br /><br />The quality of the prints are terrible, honestly. They're so faded that they may as well be of the original polaroid film quality-- but this isn't so bad. Everyone in the family thought it was charming. The printer itself ended up printing bizarre lines in a consistent place no matter which paper pack we used, so it looks like our thermal head is having problems. Oh well we just kept using it anyway! The result was a very fun and easy to cobble together diary or journal. I'm very excited to see the future of this technology.<br /><br />Buyer beware:<br /><br />* The battery is terrible. Have the charger nearby.<br />* Phone compatibility could be better. Unless you have an android, your smart phone won't work. Definitely no iPod support.  We had very good luck on the older non-smartphones though. It seemed as if nearly every one had some sort of support for it.  None of this is the fault of the Polaroid, but instead phone manufacturers who only opt to support certain parts of Bluetooth.<br />* Speculative: It looks like Polaroid is going to abandon support for this printer very soon, as they seem to be unloading these things for massive discounts and are practically dumping expired versions of the paper to amazon customers.

I have only printed a few pages and I am inpressed.  Printing a paypal email notification invoice with small amounts of color and scattered text coverage, 14 seconds from mouse click to in my hand done.  Thats pretty fast.

So far I am happy with my purchase.  I was afraid to try a new brand but I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The start-up manual is written in literally every language under the sun, all the info is on the disk which is fine.  They forget to tell you the power switch is on the lower left of the case, no biggie.  Unpacking is pretty easy, you have to take out all of the safety shipping lockout pieces and load it with paper.  If you can carry it in the house you can set it up yourself, not terribly heavy.  If it goes into power save mode you can press the cancel button to wake it up and have instant printing again.  Super fast!

The big problem is that I now have a stack of several dozen pages over the last hour - one with the ethernet and one with the "failed to associate" wireless for each vain attempt.  It doesn't say why, I can't monitor the connection progress, it gives no details...  Meanwhile it doesn't remember the IP address to ask for the same one, so I have to change all my computers assuming I can ever get it connected.  It is fine as long as everything is working.  When it isn't, it is so completely broken that you can't restore connectivity.<br /><br />I literally have 3 laptops running one of each of the OSes and they are all connected to the printer.  I used the Mac for the setup.<br /><br />WINDOWS OR MAC FOR SETUP will be easy, especially if you attach it via ethernet or USB to start.<br /><br />I was able to do the setup entirely via wireless, using my Mac though the included setup application was a bit touchy about finding and associating with the printer's default adhoc.  When done though, the web page came up and I moved everything to my main AP (though you do have to do the reset printserver on the network setup page).<br /><br />It might be possible to do the setup under Linux or anything else with a browser using the web page.<br /><br />By default it creates a 169.254 IP address and a "SETUP" ad-hoc network on channel 11, so if you join you can use the web page.

Trays are also expensive but at least are available - 2x and you will be printing large docs (like I need) without stopping.  Non refill toner is also a bit expensive.<br /><br />Upsides: Duplex is proportionately fast, some printers go to 1/3 or 1/4 when duplexing instead of 1/2.  Inexpensive, but has all the interfaces for a network printer.  Easy to configure (though not quite painless, is any network printer painless?).  Compact so fits anywhere, light enough to move.<br /><br />This is based on just installing and starting some massive print jobs, but having it work on 3 different OS computers with out major headaches, I'm giving it 4 stars.<br /><br />The 5th star is withheld since the configuration tool is touchy and probably not needed, and supplies are expensive v.s. the printer cost.

I am an amateur photographer and a gadget geek, I think the two go together.  I previously had a canon all-in-one printer (Canon MP830) that I have been happy with for 4 years but decided that I wanted to go wireless.  I did an exhaustive search and decided on this printer for several reasons:<br /><br />1.  Good black and white photo capability (something my previous printer lacked)<br />2.  Airprint capability (works with my iPad and iPhone)<br />3.  Wireless capability (my network has a desktop, 2 laptops, and the aforementioned iPad and iPhone)<br /><br />I am very pleased with my purchase.  I set up the wireless capability before realizing that I needed a firmware upgrade to use Airprint.  I attached the printer to my desktop with a USB cable, downloaded the firmware update, then removed the USB cable (I am trying to be as wireless as possible) and voila, Airprint worked.<br /><br />It was surprisingly simple.  The look of the printer is sleek when the screen is down, it is relatively quiet (relative to my previous printer), the first page is a bit slow to print but it will spool numerous jobs so you do not have to wait.  Once it begins printing it is fast for an inkjet.  Controls are easy and duplex printing (two sided) is a breeze.  I have had no compatibility problems whatsoever.<br /><br />Photos look very nice and Black and White is MUCH better than on my previous printer.  I do not print a ton of photos but when I do it is nice to have this kind of quality.  Speed is not really an issue for me for photos but this printer is still much faster than my old printer.<br /><br />The only thing I am unsure of at this point is ink use, but based on previous history with Canon I do not expect it to be an issue.  The ink tanks are fairly small but with the number of them I do not expect excessive refills to be necessary.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this printer and have recommended it, or one of the lower models depending on budget, to several friends.;;5.0;;November 17, 2011;;7;;9;;0.777778

I chalked the paper curl issue up to a few people having an abnormal issue.  Nope.  The curling is 100% reality, and way too severe for me to deal with.  We print 100's of pages at a time for our home business.  Even the large stacks of paper after printing, don't uncurl.  You end up with what looks like a "skateboard halfpipe" made out of paper.  Individual sheets are even worse.  Try taking a stack of curled paper and banging the edges against the desk as you do to straighten up a stack of paper. Doesn't really work too well.<br />  Another issue, that did go away, was it did print some marks on the left border of the paper for about the first 20 or 40 sheets, but then went away.  If this was just a start up issue, and doesn't happen every time you put a new toner in, then I wouldn't even care, personally.  We didn't get far enough to replace the toner, so I can't say which one it is.<br />  If your looking to make "paper chain links", or "paper telescopes" for your kids, this printer is ideal for you! Otherwise, there are better printers that cost a lot less and do just as good a job or better. In the end of the day, the paper curl is a MAJOR flaw and there is no need to deal with it or this printer.;;2.0;;March 7, 2012;;4;;5;;0.8

After using it for a short while my ink ran out and I thought no big deal I will just run to the store and get it refilled (just like with my HP). I tried 3 different stores and it turns out that it is not possible to fill Epson printer cartridges at these stores because of a security chip that prevents it. I should have done my research about Epson printers before I purchased one. The only perk about the Epson printers (after doing a lot of research about finding a cheaper alternative) is that they work great with C.I.S. (Continuous Ink System) look it up they are great! For around $50+ I can buy a system that hacks the Epson chip block and provides me with thousands of copy's and refilling all the colors is only around $25!! If you are tired of spending to much on ink look into your own C.I.S. for your Epson.;;3.0;;July 15, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

I have never written a review on Amazon before, but the tech tyranny of this oppressive printer has prompted me to share.<br /><br />In summation, this printer has been crippled by the Brother company's greed. This printer forces you to exchange toner cartridges at a specific page print count rather than based on actual toner level. This forces you to purchase a new toner even when your current toner is printing with perfect quality. I have been forced by the printer to change the toner every two weeks. This is $150 per month for small business usage. $1800 a year in toner is absurd for any printer.  If I was running out of toner I would be OK with this, because I would know that I had received what I had paid for. With this printer, its arbitrarily imposed page count guarantees a customer screwing. Brother probably disagrees, but they built the thing, so I'll leave it to you to decide.<br /><br />The cartridges have an internal mechanism that releases when input into the printer. The mechanism is activated the first time the toner is inserted, guaranteeing replacement of any toner that is removed to be refilled or even shaken.<br /><br />The printer also uses an internal laser to measure toner level inside the cartridge through two small reflective pieces built into each cartridge. If the toner is low the printer stops until a new cartridge is inserted. Since this happens based on a page count in the printer's memory printing will stop during the middle of a print job rather than gradually degrade in quality, which is the typical indicating a cartridge needs to be replaced. What this means for real life application is....stop your work and go get a brand new ($75) Brother toner cartridge, then finish your print.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, about half of the time you install a new official Brother toner, the printer will still not unlock itself and you must call technical support to get the reset sequence. This is a minimum 30 min phone call.<br /><br />Brother has spent more time and energy into designing systems to make you purchase their toner than they have into building a quality printer. This printer may work if you print less than 3k pages a year. For everyone else or a small business is is a completely worthless money pit.<br /><br />As I could not find it anywhere online, I am posting the Brother printer toner reset sequence here. While it won't save you from a crippled printer, it may help current owners avoid the dreaded tech support phone call.<br /><br />Brother Toner Reset Sequence<br />HL-5370DW Model<br /><br />1.With Printer off open the front door<br />2.Hold the Status & Go button as you turn the printer on.<br />3.All lights will turn on.

Tech Support was some of the best I've encountered over the many years I've used computers.  The support people were friendly, patient and very competent.  The printer is great!  Although it is monochrome, images are crisp and clear in black and white and text quality rivals any high-priced printer I've used.

I have router D-Link Dir 655, which allows my wireless laptop to print from another room, 30 feet away.  It is easy to setup and I don't have to read the manual. The printer has no problem recognizing my router.  But I have to connect using USB cable first and then set up the wireless mode.  I think the router makes a big different.

The results have been a mixed bag so far.<br /><br />Starting with the software installation I was nervous (I used the recommended installation not the full), the software said it would take 8 minutes to install, on my first attempt after 45 minutes the program appeared to be locked up I rebooted had to uninstall what was installed reboot again and begin the installation. The second attempt installed but it took the better part of 30 minutes.<br /><br />After printing a few pages of text everything seemed to be working fine. I installed the HP 100 gray cartridge and printed a few black and white photos that looked great.<br /><br />I switcheed to the HP 99 color photo cartridge and loaded some 4x6 HP photo paper into the tray and printed a very nice looking color print. On the second print the printer stopped at about 25% of the photo, apparently a jam.<br /><br />I removed the paper and tried again, same thing about 25% and stop. After 4 attempts I removed the 4X6 from the bottom tray and fed a single sheet through the top envelope feeder. The print worked but had blotches of color. I tried an 8.5 x 11 photo sheet and 90% of the photo looked great but again blotches of color in some areas.<br /><br />I ran the printhead cleaning, alignment and calibration routines and now it is printing beautiful prints. Unfortunatly I had to waste several photo papers and a good amount of ink in order to get it working well. My fingers are crossed that I will not have similar problems in the future.<br /><br />Regarding ink usage I have printed 8 - 8x10's and about 10 or so 4x6 photos and the estimate shows that approximately 70% remains in the cartridges. Ink for this printer is not cheap at about $25 per cartridge for the photo inks (14ml) which work in conjunction with the tri color cartridge (14ml), the black cartridge is higher capacity (21ml).<br /><br />All in all I would have rated this printer higher if not for the software installation issues and the failure of the printer to work with 4x6 paper from the bottom tray (one sheet at a time from the top works but is tedious). The letter size photo paper feeds fine from the lower tray but the 8x10 images are sometimes not square with the page.;;3.0;;March 23, 2008;;10;;12;;0.833333

NO more HP for me.;;Seems to me HP started going down hill in quality and reliability about the same time Ms. Fiorina was at the helm.  She sent a lot of HP jobs overseas and created total chaos out of the ill fated Compaq merger.  The company has never really recovered from that.  She was fired but the damage has infected the company like nothing else in its long history. HP used to be the gold standard in inkjet printers that every other company measured itself against.<br /><br />I went through two of the 470 mobile printers in a couple of months and ended up sending one back to my IT department and trashing the other one. I also had an Office jet printer I purchased for my home office a couple of years ago and it died prematurely as well.  My HP small form factor Desktop had the hard drive crash twice, the first time at least was under warranty and was replaced.  It still acts up every now and then and I have had to reinstall Windows XP from scratch more than once, thank god for backups! The 470 mobile printer can't stand up to the everyday travel and kept jamming, flashing all sorts of stupid warning lights and codes.  The first one lasted 6 or 7 weeks, and its replacement quit after 2 weeks.<br /><br />I was on the road when the last one died since I travel constantly for my job, so I went to a local Office Depot and got myself a Canon Pixma 90 and I am still using it 2 years later.

However due to a sale it was less expensive to purchase at my local box store. My cost was under $70 for the unit, and it was well worth it.<br /><br />This is a network MFC, and can connect as wired or wireless to a home or small business network. There is bundled software for Mac and PC operating systems. I have been able to install and get full functionality with Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP PC's and MAC laptops. If you don't wish to run this as a network MFC, it will also work well as a USB MFC attached directly to a PC.<br /><br />Bundled with this unit is a free copy and license for Paperport 11. Paperport helps to organize scanned documents. It isn't fantastic software, but it is nice to have bundled with this printer. Also included is the Brother control center, which is software unique to Brother that helps control the MFC functions (such as scan a picture, or use OCR to process a document). For Mac's Presto PageManage is available with this printer. I haven't use this product, and don't know how it compares to Paperport.<br /><br />Printer status and problems can be reported to any PC configured to accept status information via the Brother status monitor. If paper is out, or ink is low, a warning can either be popped up, or shown as an icon on the system tray (at least in Windows, how exactly this would work with Mac OS I do not know). If your printer is in another room, being able to see it's status from a distant PC is helpful.<br /><br />On standby the MFC-J615W uses only 3.5 watts, other similar devices seem to use more power. Low power use is a good reason to consider this MFC unit.<br /><br />It ships well packed, and is easy to open and set up. The ink is in sealed packages that tear open without the need for any scissor or knife. Most of the unpack and set up centers around removing tape and plastic that is just about everywhere. There are a few hard plastic pieces that must be removed to clear the inkjet cartridge insert area and to release the bottom paper drawer to open. The default for the paper drawer is to have very small paper (4" picture size paper), it needed to be adjusted (which is easy) to hold 8.5 x 11" copy paper. It prints on copy paper without issue.<br /><br />The paper tray is a bit flimsy, it is made of thin plastic. The paper output handling is not great, which is why one star was removed. There is a slide out catch which is a thin 2" wide piece of plastic in the center of the output page, it doesn't work 100% of the time, and is extremely flimsy. Occasionally paper will fly out the front of the printer. The catch can't handle more than about 10 or so pieces of paper, if printing a lot, someone must go to the printer to grab pages out, or paper will be on the floor. If set up on a table or other area, make certain there is no airflow and provide ample room for the paper to fall to the front of the printer and remain in some order. This is useful only for very small, proximal workgroups or in homes, mostly due to the limited output paper handling.<br /><br />Prints are not as vivid on standard copy paper as I'd have hoped. Colors look a bit washed. Recently I tried non-Brother picture paper and the colors came out looking great. To get vivid colors out of this printer requires high quality paper, without it, the colors are a bit bland. However for the price, and as a basic utility printer, this is very acceptable. I almost exclusively use inexpensive copy paper as the colors and quality of the print from this printer on regular 20 lb copy paper is more than acceptable to me.<br /><br />There are vivid option and fine options which can be selected as defaults or per print, these greatly improve the overall quality of prints on any paper, but also increase the time to print each page. Color does look better on inkjet specific paper than on standard copy paper. Reasonably small point type can be read (7-8 point) without having to use the high resolution feature on regular copy paper or high quality inkjet paper. Pages print reasonably fast at the default setting, but no where near the rated speed from the description, more like 2-3 pages per minute.<br /><br />There is a low resolution option and ink save option, I haven't used these. The low resolution option may get something close to the rated speed, but would probably only be good enough for drafts. In my home we don't print a lot of reports a day, and there isn't much need to get super fast prints. Also the large input tray only holds 100 pages of 20 lb copy paper, there is a smaller picture paper tray that seems to hold 10-12 blank pictures. 3rd party ink is readily available and inexpensive, there doesn't seem to be a need to try and conserve ink. My cost per page is about a cent or less for ink.<br /><br />Set up for network printing and scanning is easy, the ethernet connection can be wired or wireless, as there is a built in fax machine with a touch tone keyboard, entering in a wireless password was easy (just type the number 2 multiple times to scroll through a, b, c, A, B, C, 2, and so on for each digit / number you need). WEP, WPA, AES, TPIK are all supported. Wireless range seemed reasonable but not stellar.<br /><br />Network scans permit files to be sent to a PC with appropriate Brother software installed. You can select which PC to send a scan to at the MFC, or you can load the ADF (automatic document feeder) or flatbed and got to a PC then directly request a scan from the PC to pull a document in. Either way it was easy to scan. The ADF is also flimsy, and doesn't seem to hold the rated 15 pages, more like 8-10. So far paper handling of the ADF has been reasonable, there have been no jams, but occasionally a sheet will go a bit too far to one side and need to be rescanned.<br /><br />A nice surprise with this MFC, and if I understand correctly with just about all newer MFC's is there is no longer a bulb warm up delay. My old scanner waited a minute or two when inserting something to scan for the bulb to warm up. The newer scanners with LED bulbs no longer need to delay before scanning, this allows a fax or scan of an item just about instantly. There is no longer any need to wait for a bulb to warm up.<br /><br />Faxes can be sent to a PC on your LAN, without being printed. This permits you to save paper, and review a fax before printing. Over the years I've had several fax MFC's, and this is by far the best with my VOIP service. I have yet to have a fax at normal resolution fail using my VOIP provider (Ooma).<br /><br />There is a nice LCD display on the front, which is backlit and in color, it is easy to read and can tilt. It offers status and set up information and makes using this MFC in stand alone mode very easy. It also helped when setting up wireless.<br /><br />I have installed the free Brother iprint / iscan app on my Android phone (this app exists for Android and iPhones in their respective marketplaces), it permits these phones to print wirelessly to the J615W printer and also to scan documents to this printer. Unfortunately it only seems to work with pictures from the camera, it would be nice to print downloaded .doc, .pdf and even full web pages. Prints are reasonably fast, but seem to be fixed to the size of the photo. You can set the size of the image by the selected page size. The Brother phone application will enlarge the print to fit. 8.5 x 11 prints are borderless from the phone. There is a problem with very high resolution images, I got an internal error pop up when printing from my Android using the highest resolution. A crop or another picture at the standard (not the highest) resolution solved the problem. It seems like a bug or problem with the Android app. Still it's nice to be able to get direct prints from my phone.<br /><br />Ink cartridges from 3rd parties are inexpensive, and the cost per page is very low. There are refillable 3rd party cartridges readily available. Brother brand cartridges seem to be a pain to refill, but there are numerous inexpensive 3rd party cartridges, some refillable, the cartridge size you will want is LC61. After 2 months of ownership, I have printed 137 pages of which 130 were color. On average my ink cartridges are more than 50% full. I'd estimate at least 200 pages per cartridge based on my personal use. I bought full cartridges from a store at Amazon (the printer ships with sample cartridges). The cost was $12.50 with free shipping for 3 of each cartridge. I estimate my cost for ink per page will be about 2 cents or less with the J615W. There are refillable cartridges which I may investigate later, for now the printer does a sufficient job and 2 cents per page is reasonable to me based on sparse printing.<br /><br />If you want a modern, networked, capable inkjet MFC, this is a very good bargain in my opinion. The J615W is low profile, consumes very little electrical power, is reasonably fast, prints nice pictures, is inexpensive to purchase, is inexpensive to operate, hasn't jammed for me in 4 weeks of ownership, and works well with an Android or iPhone.<br /><br />Note, this is mostly for a home with a small network and a few computers / laptops, or a small businesses, the paper capacity is limited, there is no letter feeder, paper handling is limited, but up to legal paper can be printed and scanned. Envelopes can be printed, but the entire tray has to be removed and replaced with envelopes. An envelope slot would have been appreciated.<br /><br />The Brother control and status monitor software is very good, and lets me know when paper is out, remote configuration also works well, each button on the printer can be assigned to a program on my PC, for example when sending a picture instead of sending a .png or .jpg, I elected to send a .pdf so multiple pictures could be scanned at once and put in a single file on my PC. I am able to select which folder to put files from the printer. Brother also lets me remotely see the status of each ink cartridge and alerts me if ink is low. Multiple Brother printers / MFC's can be monitored from the advanced Brother control center at the same time. I currently have 3 Brother printers on my network, and get alerts if any have a problem, and I'm able to remotely monitor / configure each. For a home or for a small group, this is a tremendous value and is very versatile.;;4.0;;December 18, 2010;;194;;199;;0.974874

I'm very happy with all aspects of this printer and would recommend it highly to others who need a portable printer for similar purposes.  I will warn you that it does go through ink fairly quickly, so be sure to bring along extra cartridges.  Also, the manufacturer recommends that if you are taking this in a plane, that there can be some leakage due to pressure changes if you travel with a full cartridge in the printer.  Therefore, the first time I took the printer with me on a plane, I made sure not to install the first cartridges until after arriving at my destination.

I am a techno savvy, 'Gadgety' person and love to try new gadgets. The day I got it I sat down at my desk and read all the manuals and guides that came with it completely before even charging the battery. Then I minutely examined the entire contents of the package. I was surprised to find a tiny screw wedged in the internal paper path of the printer. It was no problem to dislodge and remove. I again inspected the printer carefully, unable to find where the screw might have come from. (must have been dropped inside during manufacture) Having satisfied my curiosity and assured myself that things were good to go, I plugged it in and charged it up, rereading the manual while waiting for it to finish charging. I took some pics with my LG VX9900 enV cell phone and located some pics on my Canon SD 1100is camera that I wanted to print. When everything was good to go, I proceeded to print my pics from the camera and the phone. The printer worked flawlessly with both devices. I truly believe that anything will work if you 'read and follow instructions'. Loading the film media couldn't have been easier. Getting the printer to pair with my cell phone via bluetooth was simple. Using Pictbridge with my camera was easy. And, most important of all to me, it was loads of fun to use! Before I bought this little printer, I researched the compatibility with my various devices, so compatibility was never an issue. As far as the strikes that other reviewers have given this printer all I can say is that this is a GADGET. It was never meant to compete with a full size printer. Sure the print quality is only adequate rather than superb. Sure the prints are tiny. Sure the media/paper is expensive in comparison to the cost per print of 35mm developed photos. But! You don't have the portable convenience using either of those other options. Yes, the transformer for charging this printer is huge in comparison to the size of the device. Yes the battery life leaves much to be desired. But what do you expect from a gadget/toy? I for one am very pleased with the performance of the Pogo. It is no more and no less than what I expected. And when I take it out with me to print pics on the fly, the 'Ooh and Ah' factor is quite gratifying, to say the least. In conclusion, all I can say is to review your own expectations before you commit to buy any kind of tech gadget, do your research and then make an informed buying decision.;;4.0;;May 4, 2009;;19;;19;;1.0

I got it so I could print from my iPad and iPhone. But if I new it had so many features, I would have gotten this long ago. From the automatic set up, to the way the screen moves and paper tray comes out, to printing by sending the unit an email from anywhere. So cool. On top of that, you can print recipes, coupons, fandango tickets, and even coloring book pages from the internet using the touchscreen. I spent hours just playing with it. If you are a techie, you have to get this printer.<br /><br />The copy/scan feature works well. The double sided printing is great.<br /><br />There are some things that could be improved.

My Lexmark did a good job of printing, but the ink was more than the cost of the printer. After researching for several months, I had to decide between the Konica Minolta and a HP. When I ordered, the hp had gone up in price, but this one had not, so the difference in price was over $140. I wanted to be able to print in color once in a while, thus the color laser. I have only printed about 100 pages so far, but the pictures I printed (even on cheap paper) have all turned out very good. The noise is a little loud, but it doesn't last very long. and yes, when installing the printer, don't put paper in it the first time you turn it on. It took quite a while to cycle through, but once it did, it has been printing with no problems. it isn't quite as fast as the hp printers we have at work, but I can wait for a few seconds. to sum up, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS PRINTER IS ONLY $100 WITH FREE SHIPPING. I think this is the best value for the dollar for a color laser printer!!!!!!! This seller is very good also, as I have ordered other items from them and they arrive earlier than the projected date, and in very good condition.;;5.0;;September 27, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

R3VYRGX38VJQKS;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2DXENZNO2JT4F;;Printer;;B00439GOL8;;Brother HL4150CDN Color Laser Printer with Duplex and Networking;;Greatest Value in Color Laser;;This is the 4th color laser I've owned.  The first two were Konica-Minolta.  They were among the first affordable ones in the market (still expensive) and one of them, Magicolor 2300dl, does a decent job considering the technology of its time.  The second and smaller one, Magicolor 2400, died in a couple of year and was slow.  The third one is HP 2025, which is much smaller (of course still much bigger than color inkject printers.) and it prints duplex.  But it takes an hour to print a full page double-sided color brochure.  Even though the color output is vibrant, the speed is miserable. So if I want 10 copies of full color image, I have to let it print over night.  I will use these printers until their drum lives end, and will sell or give away instead of spending more money on them.<br /><br />One main feature I want out of a color laser is duplex printing.  I decided to try Brother HL-4150CDN because it was sold for $250 on Amazon.com (surprised to see the price went up to $370 after I bought).  It has duplex printing and claimed to be fast.  Well, it is fast, the fastest of all color printers I have every owned.  Even though it is loud when it prints, you hear only a few seconds of noise and then it's completely quiet.<br /><br />One star was removed because of the color.  It is dry, unlike the shiny output from the HP.  I don't really mind the dry color.  The real problem is the colors being too dark.  I tried some adjustment on the configuration and it has improved but still darker than the original, or HP output.  That also means I am consuming more toner.  I've got it for a week, and I don't think I have printed so much, but the yellow toner is show half left.<br /><br />I am trying to figure out color calibration, which I've never needed to do with my previous printers.  I hope it helps.  There is a toner saving mode, I can't find how to set it yet, but I hope that helps.  Maybe at the toner saving mode it will give me a lighter but correct colors.<br /><br />--Update---<br />The yellow color showing half full was not correct.  It shows that way when you look at the printer admin page from the browser, but the digital window on the printer shows full.  I did a calibration, but it appears to be perfectly calibrated from the factory. I set the printer to "Toner Saving" mode and set the frequency to "Low" (I don't know what this means). Then the color has lightened but still a little darker than the HP out put.;;4.0;;December 21, 2010;;112;;113;;0.99115

I believe it had something to do with the ink cartridges I was using because they were generics I got on eBay. I had used them successfully for years but they were the type that you had to glue the chip on, and I never found a fully satisfactory way to handle this delicate business. So I wasn't too surprised when I eventually got error messages. I tried replacing the cartridges with genuine Canon cartridges, but the error messages still didn't go away, so I suspect the sensor went out and it was time to get a new printer. This time I wanted to find something smaller and simpler; a scanner and printer to use with my desktop computer and not much else. I use a printer mostly for black and white text documents, not for photos. I send my photos to a photo lab. It is more cost efficient and of superior quality to anything I've gotten out of a home printer. I also needed a quality scanner. I found both those features in the Canon MP280. It is lightweight, simple, and attractive. The prints and scans are excellent quality. I like that it has only 2 ink cartridges compared to the 5 cartridges in my MP530. The noise factor isn't a problem for me. I don't find it excessive. I have no idea why Canon didn't provide a printer cable, but I already had the cable from my MP530. Aside from that, I love my Canon MP280 and would recommend it to anyone who needs a simple printer/scanner for light to moderate use.;;5.0;;November 30, 2011;;12;;12;;1.0
R2XV02MNT13G4E;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP;;Printer;;B0002UM0PQ;;HP LaserJet 1320 Laser Printer;;excellent printer - poor documentation;;I purchased the HP LaserJet 1320 printer to replace an old HP LaserJet 4P printer.  Although the 1320 can be connected to a computer by USB 2.0, I simply used the printer parallel port cable that my old 4P used.  Despite my antiquated hook-up, the 1320 is a very fast printer.  I suspect it would be faster still if I used a USB-2 cable.  One of the biggest drawbacks to my old 4P was the long delay waiting for a page to start printing, and printing more than one page could take quite a while.  The 1320 greatly improves upon that, though, and pages print very fast using default settings and the standard 16 MB RAM installed in the printer.  As one would expect from a laser printer, the print quality is excellent even in the default mode of 600 dpi.  There is also an ink-conserving mode, or you can print up to 1200 dpi if high resolution is needed.<br /><br />Additional printer memory can be installed up to a total of 144 MB (the default 16 MB RAM is non-removable, and you can add only one DIMM).  The printer accepts a 100-pin SDRAM DIMM up to 128 MB.  I added a Kingston 128 MB 100-pin SDRAM DIMM (product number KTH-LJ4100/128) for about $40, and it works flawlessly.  Installation is very simple and straightforward, although you will need to download and refer to the HP LaserJet 1320 owner's manual to learn how to do this.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I have had no problems printing pages or envelopes.  The printer options include 2-sided printing and even booklet printing.  Envelopes are very easy to print, and a rear hatch opens easily to accept a printed envelope flatly so it does not curl during printing.<br /><br />The toner cartridge installs easily from the front of the printer.  Replacement cartridges come in two ink sizes:  2500 page and 6000 page.  Previous reviewers have claimed there is only a few dollars difference in cost between the two, but that is not my experience.  The smaller ink size prices about $60 online while the larger ink size prices around $115 online.  So there is some savings buying the larger cartridge but not what others would have you think.  Of course prices may be lower if you pay to have your cartridges refilled rather than replaced.<br /><br />The software included with the printer allows automatic driver updates from HP.  This seems to be a useful feature, and it updated itself with a newer driver right after installation.  The installation CD installs a program called HP Toolbox that monitors the printer's status, tracks how much toner is left (and how many pages have been printed), and helps troubleshoot any problems that may occur.<br /><br />My only complaint with this printer is the very poor documentation that comes with it.  A brief, printed quick-start guide is provided that will show you how to unpack and connect the printer (with diagrams, no words) but not how to use, maintain, or troubleshoot problems with the printer.  There is no printed manual to provide this information.  An online help file manual is provided on the installation CD, or you can download a complete 184-page owner's manual from HP's web site in .pdf format, which is obviously a cost-cutting manuever.  HP also saves cost by not providing any connecting cable with the printer.  The only cable provided is a power cord.  Are printed manuals and USB cables that expensive?  I realize the company is trying to keep the price low, but leaving important stuff out is pretty shabby at any price.  If you purchase this printer, make sure you own or purchase a printer cable to go with it, and you will surely want to download the full owner's manual from HP's web site so you can use your new printer properly.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, especially at Amazon's discounted price (I paid $299).  It way out-performs my old HP LaserJet 4P for which I paid $1000 several years ago.  If you are tired of spending a fortune on cartridges for an inkjet printer, buying your first laser printer, or wanting to replace an old laser printer, I would certainly recommend checking out the HP LaserJet 1320 printer.  It is an excellent printer for home or small office usage, offering great speed in printing and low cost for a laser printer.;;4.0;;April 8, 2006;;24;;27;;0.888889

I LOVED my old printer and it pained me to get rid of it.  Anyway, to make a long story short I ended up with this printer.  I was able to get it on sale at Staples for $149.99 (regularly $199.99) and knew if I didn't like it I could return it without a problem.  I never thought I would love a printer as much as my old dependable Epson, but was pleasantly surprised with this one.  I found it easy to set up (I'm not using it wireless) and easy to use.  It has a lot of features that I didn't realize I would use but the auto-duplex feature is AWESOME, also you can print multiple pages on one piece of paper and duplex it so you have a file copy (small print) without wasting so much paper and makes your paper files smaller.  Also, I am scanning more documents now and starting folders on my computer to store them to waste less paper.  I am trying to downsize on actual paper file storage space so I like that.  Also, it's nice to be able to put a piece of paper on the glass and make a copy instantly.  Toner cartridges are less expensive than most - this printer is actually cheaper to use than an ink jet and laser copies don't smudge.  I can't say enough about it!!!<br /><br />Addendum 5/2/12:  I love this printer so much I bought another one (same exact model HL-2280DW) for our winter home.  I love and use most of it's many features especially duplexing, the envelopes and card stock pass through (I do lots of both), printing and copying.  Menu is fairly easy to use - you can even duplex and resize your copies by one or two pushes of a button. Cartridges are cheap compared to others and last a long time if you think about what you're printing and set your resolution (in print properties) to 300dpi (it's actually quite good!) for the print jobs that don't really matter.  It also has a "toner save" feature that's easy to turn on and off.<br />LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!!!!!!!;;5.0;;September 12, 2011;;6;;6;;1.0

The Canon works well (and works VERY well with my Macs) but it has started to print slowly and I've always wanted to get a printer that had a bit more economical print costs (the Canon burns through ink tanks quickly and they are very expensive for the number of pages you get) as well as the ability to print from my growing number of Apple iDevices (it's a bit of a novelty, but there have been times I'm doing something on the iPad and would like to print a receipt or hard copy).<br /><br />I narrowed my search down to this Epson Workforce 845, or one of the HP multi-functions.  As I've had very bad luck with HP drivers and support in the past, I decided to purchase the WorkForce 845 since a local retailer had it on sale for the very reasonable price of $140... I was leery though because I had read many mixed things about Mac support from Epson.<br /><br />Well, it turns out those fears are well founded.  I have a relatively new iMac running OS X 10.7 Lion.  My wife has a Macbook Pro 17" running OS X Snow Leopard.<br /><br />Initially I was pretty happy... setting the printer up was relatively easy (I just added the printer when it was discovered on the network and let OS X do the rest) and was up and running in no time.  I let OS X download and install the latest available drivers for the printer.<br /><br />The problems began when I wanted to do anything other than basic print and scan with the printer... for example, make use of the "scan to PC" and "scan to PC PDF" buttons on the front of the printer.  I've always used these functions on the Canon and find them fairly indispensable.  When I choose scan to PC on the WorkForce I simply get a choice for USB.  I figured that I must simply be missing the needed software, so I downloaded the full software package from Epson and installed everything as well as updated the printer firmware to the latest version.<br /><br />Still no choice for printing to the Mac from the Epson.  Also, I observed that the Epson scan package is very very primitive compared to what Canon makes available for their printers (Canon has a full scan/print/edit management suite called MPX Navigator that works FANTASTICALLY).<br /><br />I finally broke down and called tech support.  The tech support guy tried to be helpful, but right from the start he acknowledged that the Epson software does not work fully with OS X 10.6 or 10.7.  What?  I can maybe see cutting a manufacturer a bit of slack for not supporting a new OS that's less than a year old, but SL has been out for 2.5 years at this point.<br /><br />What's even more mind boggling is that Epson clearly wants to court the Apple crowd by providing AirPrint support for iOS devices, but can't be bothered with providing full function support for Macs?  You know, the Apple devices that might actually do a decent volume of printing in your average home?<br /><br />The phone rep told me that the package needed for the network print to work is called Epson Event Manager.  I asked him why this was not included in the large "complete" download of all of the software for the 845 and he told me "well, there are still problems with Event Manager under SL and Lion".<br /><br />The rep walked me through downloading and installing this software, which promptly crashed on my Mac.  Additionally, when it IS running, and I try to print from the panel of the Epson WorkForce I eventually get a message indicating "communication error occurred".  The rep tried a few things and then sort of stammered out that it does work for some Mac users, and not others, and it has to do with how the Epson software got installed/upgraded or how OS X got installed/upgraded.  He honestly sounded thoroughly confused.  What's more, it did not work on EITHER Mac in the house, which sort of shoots some holes in the idea that there's something wrong with my particular box causing the trouble.<br /><br />I also observed that even after following the Fax setup functions, the printer doesn't seem to be able to Fax from my Macs, even though I can fax directly from the front panel just fine.<br /><br />All in all it seems as though Epson delegates Mac support completely to the back burner and it takes them months, if not years, to fix issues, if they ever do.  Also, comparing the software packages that are included from Canon to those that Epson includes is a bit of a laugh.  The Epson stuff just flat out looks archaic compared to what Canon had on the market almost three years ago.<br /><br />The saddest part about all of this is that for just straight up printing and scanning (from the PC with the scan app) the printer works pretty well... but, in all likelihood I will be returning it, because without full Mac support, I can't really keep this machine.;;2.0;;January 25, 2012;;21;;26;;0.807692
RE7E7Z35NO9A3;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AX5NEZFW9ISO9;;Printer;;B005N3FMDE;;HP Photosmart 7510 All-in-One with eFax Printer;;Great bang for the buck;;A FINAL UPDATE 5/12<br /><br />I've changed my mind about this printer 3 or 4 times. I bought it for its wireless capabilities, and I've had problems with wireless performance. That said, I've discovered that I can easily fix the recurring problem I've had with the printer disconnecting from my wireless home network. The problem doesn't exist with the printer PER SE. Sometimes, the router resets itself, and when it does, the network number changes. When that happens, the printer doesn't always read it, and when it doesn't, I can't print wirelessly from my phone or my laptop. The first time it happened, I downloaded a troubleshooter from the HP website, which fixed the problem but didn't teach me what the nature of the problem was. The second time it happened, the trouble shooter didn't work, so I called HP support. A marvelous techie (in India, no less, and still marvelous), connected to my system remotely and discovered that I had some conflicting HP software files left over from a previous HP printer. He eliminated that and then led me through the procedure to reconnect. He then told me about the nature of the problem, which was that the printer was failing to read changes in the router's port numbers. While I think that HP could probably work on this - they do, after all, build computers that read the changes, and there shouldn't be an issue with wireless printers - I can now reconnect easily just by going into the HP menu on the Windows task launcher. I ask the printer to print a status report, then type in the current numbers, and it's done. It takes 2 minutes max. The printer is absolutely wonderful in every other way, although I'll reiterate that HP could corner the market completely if they'd cut their ink prices by 25%.<br /><br />On the advice of an excellent electrical engineer, I have always leaned toward HP printers. My last model, the Office All-in-One 6100, was a maintenance-free workhorse. I would have used it until it tipped up its toes, too, except that upgrading to Windows 7 rendered it a donkey on its haunches. (Thanks, Microsoft.)<br /><br />Anyway, I had almost decided on a Canon MX882, but when I went to the local gadget store to eyeball it in person, I saw this HP. I didn't like the look of it as much as the sleek Canon, but the wireless capacities of the HP really captured my interest. In addition, the HP offers the option to use extra large ink cartridges resulting in considerable savings, while the Canon will use only the tiniest little 9 ml. versions.(To be fair, one of the Canon's black cartridges is a little bigger, but as fantastic as their print quality is, their printers are famous for being ink guzzlers.)<br /><br />Back at home, I found the HP on line at a fantastic price ($134.99 on sale at B&H Photo), and a $65.00 savings seemed significant. I ordered the HP, and I haven't been sorry. The set-up on my Windows 7 desktop and Vista laptop were so fast and easy that I thought I was missing something. In less than 30 minutes, I had this printer connected to both my computers, and in another 15 I had it connected to my iPhone - all without a hitch.<br /><br />The printer's photo quality is way better than I expected, and unlike my last all-in-one, it will print borderless photos. It's very fast for a home printer, and along with the ADF (a must for me), it duplexes! (The print intensity is automatically lowered for duplex mode, which is okay for home use but not the best for professional presentations.)<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I haven't heard any unusual or unpleasant noise from the printer.<br /><br />Another nice feature is that HP has arranged a deal with eFax that enables the owner of this machine to send or receive 20 fax pages per month at no charge. No land line is required. Nice.<br /><br />The digital control panel is bright and easy to navigate. It's also articulated to make it easy to read from high or low vantage points. For me, the available apps are superfluous, but I can see that for some users, they'd be fun and convenient. I'm an avid Photoshop and Lightroom user, so I won't be using the the HP photo software often, but I've had a look at it, and it's both user friendly and reasonably versatile.<br /><br />I'm giving the printer 4 stars only because I'm pretty disgusted with ALL printer manufacturers: they charge exorbitant prices for ink. To replace all four of the 7510's tanks with the extra large cartridges, I'll need to spend just under 80 bucks, which is ridiculous. (Suggested retail prices for the x-large cartridges are 22.99 for the black and 17.99 for each of the three colors.) I don't know about this model, but other modern printers will not allow you to print text documents in black if one of the colored tanks is depleted, which is nothing short of a ruse. I'm seriously thinking of installing a 2nd party continuous ink system, which over the printer's hopefully long lifetime will save a good deal of money. In any case, I'm reserving a 5-star rating for the first good printer that uses affordable ink.<br /><br />All in all, this machine delivers a big bang for the buck. It's fast, easy to set up, advanced, wireless, produces good quality prints, and even comes packed in a green-conscious big nylon bag rather than plastic. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a multi-purpose printer.;;4.0;;January 5, 2012;;26;;26;;1.0

It works flawlessly from anywhere in the house.  Setup was very easy (Windows XP, Vista, and an XP machine).  I like how it goes to sleep while not in use but wakes the second you send a print job to it.  The print quality is very clean, crisp, and sharp.  It is plenty fast for a home printer.  It is very compact for a laser printer and it holds plenty of paper. It simply blows away any of the inkjet printers I have ever used.  I don't know what else anyone could want for a small laserjet printer in this price range.  (Unless you absolutely NEED to print in color)  "Read Below"<br /><br />I was so happy to finally get rid of all of my ink hungry inkjet printers.  After doing a little homework I quickly discovered it was a lot cheaper to print color photographs at any photo developing store professionally than to print them at home.  Not only is it cheaper but the pictures are much better quality and they won't fade or deteriorate over time.  After you factor in the price of the ink, paper, and the fact that inkjet printers are junk and will wear out prematurely you will discover that it is extremely expensive to print photographs at home.  Sure, you can stock up on ink and pretend to save money if you buy in bulk but then you'll find that your printer dies and you are stuck with ink that won't work in any of the new printers available on the market. Some savings huh?  Now if you need to print in color for charts and graphs or another reason this printer is obviously not for you.<br /><br />I don't know what another reviewer was talking about with nagging pop ups or confirmation windows.  I have NEVER had any of these pop up on any of my computers with this printer.  Perhaps there was something else going on with that reviewers PC or the reviewer is talking about another printer?<br /><br />Bottom line:  I love this printer.  My biggest regret is that I didn't convert to laser years ago.  I have had this printer for almost 1 year now and I'm still on the original toner that came with the printer.  I would have easily spent much more money on ink then what I paid for this printer in one year.  I have easily used this printer more than I ever did my inkjets in the last year and I'm blown away the the original low yield toner is still going strong.  I have no regrets what so ever and I would absolutely recommend this to family and friends.;;5.0;;March 12, 2011;;13;;13;;1.0

It's a mixed bag of great, good, OK, not so good and ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  I'm still having PTSD from the experience.<br /><br />HP Officejet 6000 Color Inkjet Printer (CB051A#B1H)<br /><br />Lets start with the great and the good:<br /><br />* The printer was very inexpensive ($50)<br />* Included a full suite of REAL (not "starter") ink cartridges<br />* The print quality is quite good<br />* Networkable (wireless would have been nice, though at this price I'm NOT complaining)<br /><br />The mediocre:<br /><br />* clunky power supply.  Why can't it just have a power cord like other printers/AIO machines I have.<br />* not the fastest nor quietest nor smallest printer out there.<br /><br />Not-so-good:<br /><br />* costs $40 or more for a new set of cartridges, and we all know that inkjet cartridges don't last all that long.<br />* the "print head" that the cartriges snap into will set you back $73 if you need a new one.  I suspect the head lasts quite a while, so this probably isn't something to really worry about...unless you print a LOT).<br /><br />I pretty much expected this...it doesn't really bother me.  I'll probably try refilling the cartridges myself and see how that turns out.  If that doesn't work, when the cartridges run out, I'll just donate the printer to the local charity resale shop and buy myself a new one.  I bought it for a very specific purpose and probably will only use it for 20 pages a month.<br /><br />If you are looking at this printer and print dozens to hundreds of pages a month, I would encourage you strongly to look at "total cost of ownership" over the course of a 12 month period before you buy this seemingly inexpensive printer.<br /><br />If you print (like me) hundreds of pages a week of black & white text, web pages, etc., don't even think of buying this printer.  Go buy yourself a cheap laser printer and save yourself a fortune.<br /><br />********************************************************************<br />HORRIBLE - as in "IMHO, they should send someone to GITMO for this":<br />********************************************************************<br /><br />The SOFTWARE that comes with the printer. Holy Toledo, Batman.<br /><br />It takes an HOUR to install. Took me almost a full day to fully uninstall it.  It significantly screwed up the usability of my PC.  It was so uniquely horrible that I actually wrote about it on both my technology blog (ebizq.net/integrationedge) as well as my software marketing blog (softwaremarketingexperts.com) as a total software #FAIL.<br /><br />A Monumental Disaster on a disk.<br /><br />I've been building, using, selling, marketing and designing software for 25 years. Despite all the software catastrophes I've seen, I'm STILL shocked by this.  Especially that a company with the resources of HP would produce and distribute such an abomination.<br /><br />I'm tempted to send HP a bill for the 6 hours of consulting revenue I had to give up in order to restore my system and recover from the totally unannounced/unexpected reboots that resulted in me losing significant work-in-progress.<br /><br />I have never before purchased any peripheral with software that was SO BAD where I wish I hadn't bought the thing in the first place (due to the misery it caused me).<br /><br />Whatever you do, DONT INSTALL THE SOFTWARE from the included disk. Just let windows find the driver for you, or do a search for deskjet6000 driver and just download that little piece of software.<br /><br />Apart from all that, it's a great little printer.  I feel better already.;;2.0;;August 20, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

Technically everything works the way it's supposed to - scan, copy, fax, cd print, etc.  However, the colors that are printed even on high quality paper are all just OFF.  Many of the colors look dull or muddy or washed out.  I printed a few color documents on plain copy paper and they were such poor quality they all had to go straight in the shredder.  I started using the high quality bright white paper but even that did not help much.  I just printed one document that should have had a bright eggplant colored section and when printed on the Artisan that color looks purple-ish brown - and light on the purple and heavy on the brown.  The same document printed on my 10 year old HP looks like the eggplant color that shows up on my computer screen.  I've had a rich sky blue turn out blue gray and a bright hunter green turn out more like dark spruce and a bright royal navy blue turn out blackish blue.  There are many ways to adjust the print quality and the color settings but it all still falls short.  There hasn't been one group of settings to select and save and have every page printed afterwards come out right.  I have been working with many colors schemes and every single page would have to have print settings adjusted individually before printing to get colors even close to what they should be.  I don't have the time nor the patience to adjust the settings on each page every time I print.  I am absolutely amazed that this printer got so many positive reviews.  If you are printing photos almost exclusively then this might be an OK printer for you.  If you plan on printing documents of any kind and especially high quality color docs then this printer will be very disappointing.<br /><br />I know the pigment based ink is generally not as bright as the dye based but this ink is not acceptable for anything other than photos.  I even changed my ink to dye based to see if the colors would improve enough to make it worthwhile to keep using the printer.  The colors did improve a small amount as far as matching and not looking so washed out or brown but the printer still seems to print pages with the blues and greens toned way down or with reds and darker colors all towards the brown side.  I am already shopping for another printer to replace this one.  I have many color pages on my computer that I cannot print with this Epson at all due to the colors not matching.  My computer monitor has been color calibrated and my software color matching is set just the way it should be.  I can print a page on the old HP and print the same page on the Epson and put the 2 pages side by side and it looks as if the color scheme was changed on the computer.  It's just this printer that doesn't seem to have the proper color matching functions.<br /><br />If you want to print mostly photos this printer may work for you.  If you lean more towards the graphic design color document type printing then shop around more before choosing this one.  And if you are printing mostly photos then you probably won't have any interest in the document feeder and fax functions so you can likely find a good photo printer that costs less than this one or at least takes up less space.<br /><br />Overall this printer has been a huge disappointment.  I don't know if its just the Artisan 837 model in particular or if all the Epsons are poor with color matching.  I would NOT recommend this model printer at all.  Not sure if I even want to try an Epson again.  I will likely be going back to HP's or taking a look at Canon.  The main purpose of a printer is to print.  This one doesn't do that in a quality way.  I wouldn't have another one if someone offered it to me for free.;;1.0;;April 15, 2012;;11;;13;;0.846154
R1H4CN6FGHQTY;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS;;Printer;;B00439GOKY;;Brother HL4570CDW Color Laser Printer with Wireless Networking and Duplex;;Best mid-range laser printer with curling paper problem;;I hope the one message I can get out to everyone is that printers are one of the most undependable machines that anyone can look to purchase.  I run a home business and I made the mistake of spending well over $1k a few years back for a Konica Minolta 5430DL.  It was a beauty of a printer, but shortly after spending nearly $600 in replacement cartridges the printer started falling apart.<br /><br />What I learned is that even the priciest printers break.  This is more of a disposable technology than something you can hand down to your kids.  When all the printer companies play the game of selling printers with limited ink cartridges and then charging you more than the printer itself for refills, you know that the only way to come out ahead is to buy the best bang-for-the-buck printer with the expectation that it's only going to last a few short years.<br /><br />I believe the Brother HL4570 is that kind of printer.<br /><br />For $400 I knew I was buying something mid-range.  It would certainly be a step down from the $1k Konica Minolta but at least the value of the printer is close to the value of replacing cartridges.  This means when I finally deplete the cartridges I have the choice of buying more cartridges or another printer -- whichever costs less.<br /><br />I chose Brother because I wanted a wireless printer that played well with Mac.  If read on counteless discussion forums that more than any other brand, the Brother is the easiest to install with a Macintosh computer.<br /><br />Those discussion forums were correct.  The wireless setup with my iMac took less than 10 minutes to complete.<br /><br />...but I am getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />Bought this printer when it dropped in price to $399 from $450.  Had it shipped Amazon Prime 2-day and Fedex delivered it overnight.  It's rather heavy, weighing in at about 65 lbs.  The unit is well packaged.  Be sure to read the quick-start manual for important unpacking instructions.  There are a lot of doors and drawers that you need to access and remove small pieces of packaging.<br /><br />Once unpacked and plugged in, the first step was to pair the printer to my WiFi.  A small LCD display lets you navigate through a setup wizard that automatically detects your WiFi network.  The next step is simply inputint the password which is a bit of a cumbersome process as you have to wade through rows of characters till you get to the numbers and letters you need.  Frankly, that part of the setup seems very old-school.  Brother could have really improved upon this process.  Be aware that as you enter each number and letter of your password that character quickly turns to an asterick to hide it.  Don't be confused by what the printer is doing.]<br /><br />Once the password was entered the printer immediately paired to my network.  No hiccups whatsoever.<br /><br />The next step was even simpler.  I put the install disc in my iMac, run it, and it automatically installs the drivers and detects my printer.  Never have I ever been able to pair a printer to my Mac or PC this easily.  It really is true -- this printer is Mac's best friend.<br /><br />I decided to do a test page which is done simply by pressing the GO button on the printer.  It didn't take long for the printer to whiz into motion and produce a page.<br /><br />Two immediate problems:  First, my room stunk of toner.  This thing put out a stench that I could not believe.  I had read another review from someone complaining about the smell this priter produces.  Fortunately, it seems, the stench was only present at the initial print.  I am hoping that the printer is just breaking itself in.  I will keep you posted on future prints.<br /><br />The second problem is page curling.  Pages come out curled.  I am using 30 weight paper which should be less prone to curling.  I understand there are adjustments you can make in the computer to lessen the curl.  I will certainly look into this and keep you posted.<br /><br />Print speed and quality is very good.  Black text looks very crisp but colors are not true to original.  I had read in another review that this Brother printer produces darker versions of the original color.  This is true.  Oranges were deeper, light blues became dark blues.  Potentially, I don't see this as a major problem -- but some who are more finicky about their printer producing true colors will not be happy.<br /><br />I won't even talk about photos.  Haven't tested photo printing because I already know it will look like garbage.  You don't use these printers for photos and anyone buying it for that use is foolish.<br /><br />Is the printer loud?  Somewhat, yes.  But realize that I am coming from a monstrous Konica Minolta machine that was even louder than this Brother.  So, for me, the printer is quieter than the more industrial sized machines I have been used to.<br /><br />Thus far, I am very impressed with the ease of setup and immediate pairing to my WiFi network and iMac.  I mean, I had this running in less than 15 minutes after full unpack.<br /><br />As for overall quality?  It is what I expect from a $400 laser printer.  It's speedy with highly acceptable print quality.  However, it's not on par with business class machines.  It suffers from subdued color reproduction, colors are slightly darker than they should be and pages curl.<br /><br />The machine awakens from sleep and produces a page in less than 10 seconds.  This is great.  My Konica Minolta would wake from sleep and go through a minute of two of machine "whirring" until it decided to spit out a page.<br /><br />For $400 this doesn't seem to be a significant step down from my $1k Konica Minolta business class computer and that's why I am not complaining.<br /><br />You can read through countless reviews on Amazon hoping to get the right printer.  Every single one of them has a handful of bad reviews and complaints about breakage and toner cost.  I found the Brother, particularly this model, to be the better rated printer in its price range.  Certainly toner replacement will be a little cheaper than going with HP.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />The stench I was experiencing with print jobs has lessened, though there is still the slightest odor of print toner whenever I run the printer.  I am hoping this subsides with age.<br /><br />Went into PRINT SETTINGS on my Mac and selected REDUCE PAGE CURLING.  It did very little to curb the problem.  This printer still produces curled prints and that's the only annoying issue I still have with this printer.<br /><br />In all, the Brother 4570 is probably the best color laser printer in the $400 range.  Certainly a better option than purchasing an HP which comes with limited-filled toner cartridges and (from reviews I have read on Amazon) its own set of headaches.;;4.0;;February 5, 2011;;129;;132;;0.977273

I like that it has a built-in straight-through paper path option, for handling heavier stock.<br /><br />However, connecting this printer directly to a network can be challenging, especially a wireless network. For wireless, you will need to get both the wired and wireless MAC address codes, as it must be connected to a wired network before connecting to a wireless network. The wireless MAC address does not appear on the diagnostic printout used to find the MAC address. I finally stumbled upon the address by connecting the printer to a wired network, and pointing my web browser to the printer's IP address, and using the embedded web-based diagnostics there to check wireless settings.

I recently purchased an HP LaserJet P2055d printer directly from HP -- on sale at an excellent price and I got an additional discount through my professional association. The P2055d replaced my 15-year-old HPLJ5p, which I gave to my wife because her Canon InkJet C600 had died -- and HP offered me [...] to trade that in (they even paid the shipping). So, it was super deal as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />I wanted something similar to my old HLPJ5p, that is just a black-and-white laser printer -- I have no need for color in my business, and I did not want an all-in-one unit as I have a separate fax machine (rarely used anymore due to e-mail) and scanner. I figure that it's better to have separate machines as a problem with one will still allow me to use the others. I also have no need for a network printer such as the more expensive P2055dn, although I can still print to the P2055d from my laptop or my wife's computer through the router as long as my desktop computer is on (the P2055d is connected to my desktop via a USB cable).<br /><br />I particularly like the P2055d's speed, which is many times faster than my old 5p, and its ability to do automatic duplex (two-sided) printing as well as single-sided printing; duplex not only saves paper but filing space as well. The print quality is exceptional, true 1200 dpi, which creates very professional-looking output -- image counts in my business. Also, as someone else pointed out, the CE505X high-capacity toner cartridges (rated at 6500 pages) are also great -- excellent price on them from Amazon. The paper drawer has good capacity, about half a ream, the same as my old HPLJ5p. The printer also handles envelopes, letterhead, and labels easily via a separate paper feed. And the printer has a relatively small footprint, actually a bit smaller than my old 5P (but a tad taller), so it fits nicely on the cabinet adjacent to my desk.<br /><br />My only complaint is the difficulty I had installing the correct driver. I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit, and the driver initially found and installed by Windows did not allow for duplex printing and was limited to 600 dpi. A call to HP support was not very helpful -- the tech had me download and install another driver, which was rather limited (instead of 1200 dpi, it included only high and low resolution). However, I decided to try one of the other drivers on the HP site, and after some trial and error got it running. Perfect! The correct driver file as of December 2010 is called "P2055_default_install_v6.1_ww.exe"; it's Version 61.093.02.77 (dated 3 Jun 2010). Make sure the printer's USB cable is not plugged in until the installation routine asks you to do so.;;5.0;;December 4, 2010;;63;;63;;1.0

At that point it all came to a halt.  I called Customer Support, and had no trouble getting to a tech who instructed me to try several things to get the machine to print.  Nothing worked, and the printer remained dead in the water.  The tech then explained the process for getting a replacement printer (do nothing until the second printer arrived.  Instructions would be included for returning the first printer).  In a little more than a week the replacement arrived.  Included was the prepaid return mailing label which made the process fairly easy.  My only complaint was the instruction that the old printer had to be mailed within 3 business days, or a second complete charge would be made to my credit card.  The tech when explaining the process had said 5 business days.  I realize that a company has to guard against someone trying to pull a fast one and get two printers for the price of one, but that language was just a bit threatening.<br />As to how the replacement turned out, at this point I can not say for sure.  I had to leave home the next day and had time to only test the copy, scan, and printer functions.  Since we had previously installed the software on our PC, the second install was a brease.  Prints were very clean and the photo prints were beautiful.  So far We are very pleased, and if the fax functions do as well, I would give this printer 5 stars (we have had 5 printers to date, and they all had problems of some kind along the way).

It worked well enough for thbe 5 months we were trwveling in our RV.  When we resumed our travels in October 2011, it worked for about a week on the road & then gave all sorts of reasons for not printing, like the cover was opened when it was close and  the cartridges were stuck when they weren't.  Since I need a printer to print out  our daily routes, and I didn't have my HP papers with me, I bought this HP 100 on Amazon.  It worked fine for a day.  Then in the middle of a print job, the paper ran out.  I loaded more, but the printer.  merely flashed lights as if it were the honored guest at a rock show.  It wouldn't print.  I couldn't get the On button to go off until I removed the battery. After letting it rest, I put the battery back in. And then the On button wouldn't go on.<br /><br />I returned it and got a replacement.  It printed fine until it, too, ran out of paper.  Again I reloaded it.  Again, I couldn't get it to print again.  I returned it and bought a Kodak Hero 3.1. Not truly portable, but smaller than most.<br /><br />Oh,  I called this "shoddy goods,"  That's because the cover, which lifts up to hold the paper came off repeatedly.  Nothing was damaged on it.  It's just that the cover wasn't made to fit precisely.  Also the paper tray slips out.  You keep having to put this thing together becaause nothing really snaps firmly into what it's supposed to.;;1.0;;November 30, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

I really like that it scans your document quickly and then sends the fax so you aren't standing there waiting for it to slowly scan and send each page. It scans, then dials and sends. It also beeps once its gone through so you don't have to stand over it to make sure it went through. It automatically re-dials if it doesn't go through the first time and prints a report to tell you if it doesn't go through at all. So you can leave the machine and know whether or not the fax was successful.<br /><br />There were a couple reviews that said that it curls the paper when it prints, this is completely accurate. While this can be annoying I don't find it to be that big of a deal.<br /><br />I also liked how long the toner lasted. My office has had this fax for about a year and I just replace the toner a month or so ago and we get about 10-20 pages in a day.;;5.0;;April 29, 2007;;18;;19;;0.947368

So far I have to say that I'm loving it. I set the printer up on my Mac and it needed me to plug in the USB cable even though I chose wireless setup. Since there isn't a USB cable included in the box you might need one. I just used the power and USB cables left behind by my previous printer (an earlier model Epson that used the same plug type). If you've bought a printer in the last 5 years or so, odds are it used a USB connection so you'll probably just want to leave the end attached to your computer alone until you know if you'll be needing it or not. Setup on my other computers was all done over my wireless and was pain-free. It's worth mentioning that Amazon's default picture of the NX230 makes it look like there are wireless antennae standing up in the back. I notice mine didn't have any, and upon closer inspection of Amazon's picture, it was just the paper in the paper tray blending into the white background making the back support look like antennae.<br /><br />One small problem I had was that the printer initially wasn't detecting the red ink cartridge. I know other people have reported having this problem as well. I was able to remedy the problem, for my case at least, by pushing down firmly on the cartridge while wiggling it a bit.<br /><br />Printing time is a little longer than you would expect from a modern printer, but unless you're printing a lot of bulk jobs, it will only be a minor inconvenience at best. Despite the time, the finished prints look crisp and clean. Inkjet printers have a tendency to burn through ink like cray, and this one is no different. I usually change my print settings to the economy option to make it last longer, but the replacements can be found for under $20 at most places.<br /><br />The scanner has great resolution and can be used wirelessly - unlike the standalone scanners I've owned in the past. One great feature is that you can scan from a smartphone and then save it to your phone to do with as you please.<br /><br />Aside from the cartridge detection issue, the only other drawback is the mobile app. Aside from the scanning, I don't see how it can be useful. You can't print from apps that support the feature - only from within the Espon app. Anything that you would need to go into the Epson app to print can be printed from a PC, and since you can only use the printer from your local wireless network, you're most likely already at home and near the computer. From within the Epson app you have the option to print photos from the picture library on your mobile, any documents saved on your phone (thought I haven't figured out where they are supposed to be saved or how to save them yet, online storage (ie evernote, google docs, and dropbox), and from the web (through the included browser). If you use any of the online storage services you are going to be especially disappointed. Make sure you name your files very clearly because the preview is too small to make out any of the print, and is NOT resizeable. Unless you know exactly what you opened, you're printing blind.;;4.0;;August 8, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

I have used Brother MFC's for years and had real good service. Also a couple of different models from HP. None of them were any good. So I gave Epson a shot and they failed miserably.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this MFC is not what it advertises. The printing function seems to work well and it prints relatively fast for an inkjet. Scanning works okay but I had trouble with scan to PC. I contacted Epson twice about that feature (got someone in India). They were not much help. I guess their manual did not have enough info on my particular problem. After over an hour on the phone, we did finally get it to scan to a PC but not to PDF... I didn't have another hour for that one.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing about this "MFC" is the faxing. At my business, we fax a lot. Many times a day. Both in and out. The WP-4530 was very random on when it would send or receive a fax. Sometimes we could send to a normal business partner, other times we could not. I called Epson support (India again) and we changed some settings for the fax feature and it seemed to help some, but still at very random times, it would not send. Continued to get "communication error" after 2 pages, 7 pages, 9 pages, and every combination in between. I called customer support again (India) and we checked a few settings (basically the same ones as before). The polite young man finally ask what phone service I was using and I told him ATT. He communicated to me that ATT uses digital service and this Epson device may not always work with digital because it is set up for analog. Can you believe that! Analog! In 2012! And who would want to build a machine to work with some small insignificant company like ATT!<br />WOW! I was taken aback! I could not believe that this service rep had just told me that! Why would you build a device that will not work with one of the largest communication companies in the world!?<br /><br />If this is truly the case, Epson should have the courtesy to inform the customer of this issue so we can make a decision based on whether or not we have a digital based phone system BEFORE we order their product.<br /><br />I finally gathered my composure and thanked the rep for the help and told him I will be returning my (last) Epson to Amazon.<br /><br />I have now ordered another Brother (from Amazon of course) so I can use all features of the "MFC".;;2.0;;March 1, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

I did not want an all-in-one printer nor was I interested in printing photos.  I merely wanted a work-horse to accommodate all of our b/w and color printing needs.  The Brother printer fills the bill.  It is so fast, even in duplex mode!  The Energy-Saver feature is great.  It powers off after 3 minutes of idle.<br /><br />For $9.69, you can upgrade the memory of the printer with an additional 256 SDRAM. The folks at Brother recommend the Kingston memory module sold on Amazon.com -- Kingston 256MB DDR2 SDRAM Memory Module 256MB (1 x 256MB) DDR2 SDRAM 144pin KTH-LJ2015/256. It is easily installed via access to a side door compartment.  After installation, you can navigate to "Print settings" on your printer LCD Panel and print the page, to make sure it shows the increased RAM size.<br /><br />I love this new printer.  The ease of setup was great.  I didn't even have to follow the printed directions or CD.  I simply went to the Apple web site and downloaded the most recent drivers. Apple OS did the rest of the work.  In mere minutes, I had USB/Wireless/Ethernet connections for all of my desktop and laptop machines, including a PC.<br /><br />A manual is included that does a good job of explaining features, but they are also quite intuitive.<br /><br />The machine itself is sturdy and well-built but be warned that it occupies a fairly large footprint. For me, this was not a problem because my previous printer was also large and this one actually occupies the same space more efficiently.  The printer measures 16"W x 18" L.<br /><br />Amazon offered the best pricing on the Brother printer plus the bonus of no shipping charges/no tax. The printer requires four separate ink toner cartridges that each cost >$100 but Amazon sells them for $47-$80.  Note that there are two versions: regular and extended use.  The 310 series is regular - and the 315 series is extended use, which accounts for the difference in pricing.

The replacement ink was close to $50 so I'm already saving money with my new printer.  The wireless part of it works well.  I don't know the technical jargon so bear with me.  My printer is downstairs and my wireless router is upstairs.  Everything communicates well with no glitches or interruptions.

But in this case, since the mixed reviews I read here before buying almost discouraged me from purchasing this printer,<br /> I feel like I am obligated to write about my experience with this printer.<br /><br />I've had a HP Photosmart 3180 all-in-one for about two years now, and it still works. However, I was really sick of replacing the ink cartridges every 70 pages or so, and wanted a printer that could handle double-sided printing. I purchase a lot of digital textbooks for school since they're typically half the price, but I still want a physical book in front of me, so I typically print out chapters as needed for my courses. Printing chapters with my all-in-one HP was a HUGE CHORE, not only taking HOURS of time, but SEVERAL cartridges of ink... not to mention the frustration of manually printing two sided documents in book-layout.... agh!<br /><br />My printer just arrived this morning. I removed it from it's box, followed the included quick setup instructions, and that was that! I have NO idea what is wrong, or happened with some of the other reviewers set-up processes since mine was exactly as described in the instructions. The process couldn't have been any more straight forward! Then again, other reviewers did note their PC operating system .... and well, I guess that's Microsoft's Vista for ya. I'm on a Mac, so I didn't have to deal with solving Vista's various operating hurdles.<br /><br />In agreement with other reviews, the first-time initialization did take about 20 minutes, but it's a one time deal, so not that big of a nuisance. Actually, the first thing the printer did when I plugged it in was print out a polite little note to let me know that it was going to begin its initialization process, which could take up to 20 minutes, and could I please not interrupt the process by powering off or otherwise disturbing it. The friendly little note even suggested I work on installing the included software in the mean-time, which I did. Installation of the software again could not have been more straight-forward.<br /><br />When the printer was done initializing, I immediately opened a 96 page document, clicked the box for two-sided printing, and without issue of ANY kind, the printer got on it's way, printing 96 pages of colored, double-sided textbook pages in perfect book-layout... Ahhhh...  :-)<br /><br />I am super impressed with this printer! For the cost, I think it is totally more than worth it!;;5.0;;September 12, 2009;;106;;113;;0.938053

The printed instructions are limited to internationalized sketches that barely match reality. Generally, pull any blue tape or orange chunks of plastic.  Installing the toner cartridges is the next trial. The printer comes with the toners installed in the correct location and all you have to do is slide a lock/shutter. Sliding the locks takes a surprising amount of force, and with so much plastic, it is quite scary when it finally seems to break free and slam closed.  I fully expected to break my printer before I'd even plugged it in.<br /><br />On powering up, it automatically grabs a DHCP address off the network, and with little more than that, you're printing!  The front panel menu navigation is pretty straight forward, and you really only need to visit it once (more on that later).  It speaks standard PCL and PostScript, so you may not even have to change the drivers in your computers to get it to work.  I was able to use it as a drop-in replacement for a (hated) HP2550 Color LaserJet.<br /><br />Although I haven't tried the drivers, yet (I'm using basic PostScript) I am happy with the selection at least.  Unlike many other devices, older and esoteric versions of Windows seem to be fully supported.<br /><br />The printing is stunningly fast when compared with carousel printers like the HP2550.  Even though this model comes with a relatively small amount of memory, it has no problems cranking out full-page graphics.<br /><br />When the printer is awake, it can be pretty noisy.  It doesn't have the clunks and squeaks of the HP2550, just mostly fan noise.  Fortunately, it can be configured to go to sleep pretty quickly, and once it is sleeping, it is completely silent.  Unlike the 2550, it doesn't wake up every 8 hours, either. It wakes up automatically when a print job comes in, and does so pretty quickly.  That may not be true if you use the USB interface, though.<br /><br />Laser printers should not be hooked up the UPS devices, and this machine is no different.  The current draw on startup is enough to trigger nearby UPSs into brownout mode briefly.<br /><br />The print quality is good.  It manages to print intense colors with a somewhat glossy finish that compares remarkably well with photo printers.  That seems to come at a cost of clarity, though, as some fine detail gets a little muddy.<br /><br />Lastly, the network interface in this device is worth the entire cost of the printer. First of all, once you know the IP address of it, you never need to use the front panel again.  Every single feature is easily controllable from the web interface.  Beyond that, it has features that you would normally see in devices that cost thousands of dollars, including the ability to print-by-email, Internet Printing Protocol, the ability to print directly from an uploaded PDF file, SMNP managment, and so on.<br /><br />So far, I'm very happy with this printer!  One major problem, though: It ships with minuscule starter toner cartridges -- maybe less than 500 pages worth -- and toners are harder to find, since the Oki brand is somewhat uncommon.  At least the toners don't appear to be 'chipped', and there's a menu option (turned on by default, even) that will instruct the printer to continue even if it believes the cartridges are empty.  I expect it will give me plenty of time to get replacements.  This printer uses real toner-only cartridges, and not toner+drum units like other printers.  Despite that, the cartridges are some of the most expensive I've ever seen.  Figure in another $460 of toner costs once the starters go empty.;;4.0;;January 17, 2011;;17;;17;;1.0

The library Wi-Fi would work for us in their parking lot 24 hours a day.<br /><br />Since the Epson NX430 is small, lightweight, and has a very low power consumption, we were able to set the printer in the back seat of a car, use a 12vdc to 120vac inverter and run our office internet needs from the library parking lot. (Until Comcast came thru for us finally).<br /><br />The salesman had told us that one of the good things about Epson printers was that they do not use a small capacity "starter ink" which I found to not be true at all.  I was shocked at how quickly the black ran down on ink, in just several days of relatively small amounts of printing. I have had many ink jet and laser printers and while I am aware that ink jets use ink quickly, never had I used it up SO FAST as with this printer. So much so that I hesitate to buy more ink and am thinking of returning the unit.  There is a 14 day return policy.  I had purchased one spare black Epson 126 hi-capacity ink cartridge and will run that and keep careful track of the pages it can do, then make my decision.  This is my first Epson brand printer.<br /><br />Update one week later:  The NX430 seems to give a warning that you are running out of ink FAR TOO EARLY.  When it finally really did run out of ink a message came on the screen stating the black was totally empty and asked if I wanted the printing to proceed with a mixture of the colored inks making up the black.  I thought that was a thoughtful feature.  I have just ordered a CISS (Continuous Ink Supply System) from a company based in Florida and will report how that works out.  As many of you know these ink jet printers can have quite an appetite for ink cartridges.  I spent several hours searching for a CISS that was backed by a support system in the USA, as opposed to one from overseas.  Early CISS had various problems, some even ruined printers when they leaked.  It is important to follow the installation instructions and probably not go for the lowest price you can find.  I have recently read about what is called the "waste ink storage" container which needs to be cleaned out eventually.;;4.0;;December 13, 2011;;8;;8;;1.0

It prints quickly, and while it lacks a duplex unit, the driver does support a sort of make-shift duplex printing.  Select double sided printing, and print.  It prints one side of all pages, then you can put the stack back in the printer without changing the orientation and hit one button on the printer to print the opposite sides.  No need to remember how to manually print alternate pages in reverse order and so forth...saves me so much ink and paper.  (This works on my mac.  I assume it also works on windoze.)<br /><br />Also, I would like to point out I have printed over a ream of paper and haven't needed a new cartidge and have no signs of ink shortage.<br /><br />---Update---<br /><br />I have now had this printer for close to 4 years, so I thought I would update the review.  For the past two years, I've been using the printer substantially less.  (I am no longer a student and don't have frequent need to print things.)  I am still on the first print cartridge, and am most of the way through what is probably my third ream of paper since purchasing the printer.<br /><br />The printer still works for most things, but it has developed some problems.<br /><br />* For some reason, ink seems to stick too long on the barrel, so I get text ghosting on the page, i.e. text at the top of the page gets printed faintly again halfway down the page, on top of whatever text is supposed to be there.  This isn't bad enough to cause difficulty reading, but doesn't look very professional.  I can no longer use the printer for things like resumes.<br /><br />* Sometimes i I haven't printed anything in a while, the printer puts out a puff of smoke after ech printed page.  This isn't a problem with functionality, per se, but is sort of worrisome and makes me think the printer wont last too much longer.<br /><br />* With OS X 10.5, printing over Airport no longer works properly.  I'm more inclined to blame Apple than HP for this, but neither company seems inclined to do anything about it at this point.  I now need to physically connect the printer to my laptop with a USB cable, which is somewhat annoying.<br /><br />* There doesn't seem to be any channel for having the printer repaired or doing self maintenance.  I'm sure *someone* can fix it, but likely at more than the cost of a new printer.  Again, we are back to the sad situation of printers being sold as throw-away products.  I will probably have to buy a new printer to replace this one, even though this one should meet my needs.<br /><br />Overall, I still think this printer is a much better purchase than an InkJet, but I would lower my rating to 3 stars because HP apparently follows a design philosophy of planned obsolescence, even with their LaserJets.  I'd like to find something that is designed to last a bit longer without having to buy a huge, high-dollar office printer.  For comparison, many Apple LaserWriters (produced 1985-88) are still operational.  They just don't build them like they used to.;;4.0;;March 27, 2006;;23;;23;;1.0

Here are some detailed comments.<br /><br />1. The automatic paper feeder is well designed - the situation that multiple pages go-through at once never happens (in HP 3050, this happens a lot).<br /><br />2. Canon provided a well designed user interface - functions are easy to follow and operate, including scan / printer / copy.<br /><br />3. The automatic duplex print is excellent and make the printer worth what you paid for. But when using automatic double sided printing - the print speed turns to be less than a third (instead a half) because the mechanical parts need a lot of time to flip the paper.<br /><br />4. As some of you may have concerned, the latest firmware (02/09/2009) makes scan function smooth on a Mac - all you need is to press the scan button. This is tested on a Leopard Mac Mini.<br /><br />5. In case some of you want know the compatibility with printer servers, this printer is full compatible with Netgear PS121 printer server under windows vista (including automatic duplex) x86 and x64. It is NOT compatible with Netgear PS121 under Mac Leopard (no idea why - installation smooth and prints went through - nothing comes out of printer). This printer is NOT compatible with Maxtor Central Axis printer server function.<br /><br />To summary, this is a good printer for its price. However, concerning its powerful function, you may want spend some extra money for the 4370n to enable every function on network - if you are working in a networked environment.;;4.0;;April 2, 2009;;186;;196;;0.94898

We have given it light use as a fax machine and copier over the nearly four years that we have owned it.  Recently, we got the "toner low" message, which suggests that we have printed out nearly 2500 pages, and now have gotten a "Toner Life End" message. (See tip no. 1 below to see how we circumvented the Toner Life End message so the machine will keep printing.)<br /><br />Occasionally a misfeed, but not often.  Never a real malfunction with the machine.<br /><br />The copies are good, though a little heavier than a first-rate copy machine.  The only negative comment I have is that the machine is pretty noisy when it starts up.  Some other reviewer said that it sounded like a jet plane getting ready to take off.  Not exactly, but I know what was meant!<br /><br />The price-performance ratio is excellent.<br /><br />Here are two tips that I picked up from other reviewers, which can solve problems that bedevil those not in the know.<br /><br />1.  After the "Toner Life End" message appears, the machine refuses to print even if it has just received a fax. This can happen without further warning after the Low Toner warning appears, and the machine will refuse to print even though the cartridge in fact has more toner in it.<br /><br />Here's the tip (courtesy of C. MacPhail).  Remove the toner cartridge.  On each side of the cartridge, you will find clear plastic-covered hole. (Apparently the light from an LED on each side shines through these holes to allow the machine to determine when toner is too low.) Cover both holes with a small piece of masking tape. I used blue masking tape. Not only will this get the document that is in the machine printed out without the need to use a new cartridge, but it will also allow you to use the cartridge until the quality of the print forces a replacement of the cartridge.  That can be many hundred additional sheets.<br /><br />2.  You might get a Toner End Life error that you can't clear.<br /><br />Here's the tip (courtesy of Jeffrey L. Schronce).  Open front cover, leave toner cartridge in unit. Press options button, when "Replace Drum?" comes up quickly press the Start button. Immediately press the "1" and "0" button. The display will say "Accepted" and the error will go away. Make sure you enter those buttons quickly or it will not take.;;5.0;;July 20, 2011;;11;;11;;1.0

Trust me. It will save you a lot of trouble. And if you are using an earlier operating system, it should also work as well but I have no personal experience. Because this print server is actually several years old and was designed before Windows 7 came out, so I would be surprised that it doesn't work with earlier operating systems just as well.<br /><br />My experience with print servers has been a painful one. It started with a D-Link print server five or six years ago. It was one of the most painful computer related devices I've ever had. It required a genius willing to twist his mind, violet his natural intuition and abandon his trained logic to set it up. It had instructions that were essentially wrong and misleading. Even following a corrected procedure, it was painstaking to set up on each computer on the network. And being a wireless print server, it requires re-setup when the wireless system (router) has been changed.<br /><br />So I bought an AirLink AMPS230 after doing a lot of research. I thought I was lucky because the thing was almost effortless to set up. It was a day and night difference compared to the D-Link. But soon, I discovered that it was completely unreliable. It frequently went off-line or disconnected itself from the network and required either relinking or reboot. It was insanity.<br /><br />So I bought the TRENDnet. I hesitated a lot both because of the relatively unimpressive reviews, and also because of my painful history with print servers. I was at a point to give up on the existing printers (which are very high quality printers by the way, but just without built-in network function), and go out to spend $1000 to buy network printers for replacements. But I'm glad that I decided to try the TRENDnet first.<br /><br />When I bought it with hesitance, I had this cynical thought that it would be as difficult as the D-Link and as uneliable as the AirLink. Well no. It turned out to be more reliable than the D-Link and even easier than the AirLink. This thing took around 10 min. to set up on the network. And the setup for each computer on the network to use the print server took less than 5 min and had absolutely no confusion. And it is reliable, not a single drop from any computer on the network over the whole week (still observing and would report with a broken heart if it turns out to be false).<br /><br />If I knew it was this good, I would be willing to pay more than $200 for it. So for $55, I am not complaining.<br /><br />AN UPDATE: now the print server has worked reliably for longer than two months without a single drop. I have no reason to doubt its reliability now.<br /><br />AN IMPORTANT TIP:  I've discovered that to maintain a stable connection using a print server, the best setup is to do the following:<br /><br />(1) Make sure that your printer is connected through a standard TCP/IP port with both Port Name (given by the print server itself) and the IP address (determined by your router) correctly set. (For those who may not be familiar with this, I'm talking about printer software ports set in the operating system (Windows for example), not a physical port on the back of your computer.)  This is where different print servers behave differently. The TRENDnet shines in this critical part because it automatically sets the port correctly. All the pain I had with the print servers previously were actually rooted in this issue. The D-Link I had some years ago could not do any automatic port setting at all, and thus required painful manual setting, while the AirLink Print Server I had recently did do automatic port setting but failed to do it right. Instead of setting it to a standard TCP/IP port, the AirLink assigns a virtual USB port which turns out to be completely unreliable.<br /><br />(2) Reserve a static IP address for print server on your router. This doesn't mean you will have to change from the automatic DHCP mode to a manual mode. These are two different things. You CAN reserve a static IP address for a print server when both the print server and the router are in DHCP mode (yes, the auto DHCP mode), and you don't have to switch to the manual IP address mode in order to do so.  The fact that you can have your router and the devices operating in the DHCP mode while at the same time manually reserve static IP addresses for each individual device is something that I didn't realize until recently. I thought it was either manual or auto.<br /><br />The truth is that in order for a print server to work reliably, the TCP/IP port must have a static IP address, at least this is the case given the current status of the technology. But at the same time, because most people use a router in the DHCP mode, the port cannot maintain a static IP address by itself, unless one has been manually reserved for the print server in the router setup. This may sound strange, but I have painfully learned this to be true. All this explains why print servers remain one of the most painful and unpredictable computer devices.  This simple knowledge has suddenly made the setup of a print server crystal clear for me. Unfortunately, none of these manufacturers makes this matter clear.;;5.0;;January 30, 2011;;22;;22;;1.0

I'd been responsible for the artistic decision-making in all my printing, but didn't own the equipment.<br /><br />I bought this to experiment with last year, and I've been very satisfied so far.<br /><br />The 3880 represents the bottom of Epson's pro printer line. As a pro printer, it's big, it's heavy, but much less space-taking and heavy than the larger models. It's an eight-ink (well, nine, depending on how you count) printer, and hasn't been updated to take advantage of the slightly larger ink sets of the larger printers (4900, etc.)  However, it's gamut (the range of colors it can print) is a step above my prior printing processes, it's effectively a higher-resolution printer making sharper prints than what I waa making before, too. With Epson's inks and papers the color profiles provided are very good, I don't feel like I require a custom profile for those papers (I still have them made, or make them myself, for Ilford papers like IGS.)  Compared to traditional color photo papers most of the papers are more robust, easier to handle, rated to be more archival, and less sensitive to damage by ultraviolet light.  No big gloss differential problems.<br /><br />With archival pigment printers like this, historically, a common problem has been inkjet clogging.  I use my printer a fair bit, but I haven't seen a clog yet, and that's pretty astonishing to me.  I'm sure it will happen, but improvements here have been significant in comparison with what was available just a handful of years back.<br /><br />At around $1K, plus half that for a full set of replacement ink cartridges, it's not that big a hurdle as an investment for anyone doing a fair bit of printing, and at $4 or so for a moderate sized print (in ink/paper costs),  some of that will get paid back fairly quickly if you're using high-end labs, and shipping, for your prints today.<br /><br />I'm very satisfied. In a perfect world, I'd love to see the extra two inks the 4900 gets, but in practice, it doesn't appear that the gamut differences are significant for my own work, and given the extra space and extra $1000 investment, I don't think any photographer should feel too poorly about an sticking with the 3880 unless the larger width is an issue.<br /><br />(I do still outsource my largest prints, but the vast majority of my work fits on the 3880.);;5.0;;February 19, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

This $550 machine is lighter duty yet fine for internal business documents, some color images, and for black-&-white letters that you send out.<br /><br />Toner Use:<br />I print about 3 reams of 20 lb white paper, 1,500 papers, a month of double sided for about 3,000 page surfaces a month (double sided) with about 40% of the total pages in color. These statistics are available on the printers webpage that will come up in your web browser if you go to the Mac OS "system preferences - printer" and find the option for printer setup "show printer webpage". They are slow in coming up. On the first page home page the mono and color counts are found.<br /><br />Screen-print them, the color and mono page counts, when you put new cartridges in AND screen print them again when you replace a cartridge. Subtract the smaller number from the larger to get the number of pages of color and mono for those cartridges. My color cartridges are used up about at the same rate when using the Brother driver; the color sync driver on Mac may give a different result if it combines slightly different amounts of color to achieve a given in-between color.<br /><br />The cartridges look the same with the lower capacity ones just being less full. The lesser TN-310 low capacity size toner cartridges don't have much toner in them and only last maybe 3 reams of paper 1,500 to 2,000 pages for light mixed color and black-and-white business printing in my experience. This is up to the Brother advertised specification or better.<br /><br />The tn-315 high capacity toners say they give 6,000 USA letter pages black-and-white mono printing and I got that plus 15% using the mono (black and white) print mode with toner-save on about 1/2 the time it seems (I didn't count). On color they say 3,500 USA color letter pages and I got about 50% more than that when printing web pages without pictures but with color lettering WHILE USING ALSO the color toner save mode for about 80% of the prints.<br /><br />If you are using the toner-save mode you will get feeling that the print quality of this printer is poor but go back to the normal coverage mode and it looks very good again.<br /><br />So Brother's numbers are reasonable for average internet printing. Thank you Brother for the honesty and the fortunate fact your testing well fits my experience. Brother says they used the standard rotation of 5 standard color pages or one black and white standard page as per the ISO/IEC 19798 technical spec and this was reasonably accurate in my experience of toner usage . The old standard commonly used by printer makers before people used the internet was 5% coverage per page and was reasonably accurate for me who did mostly letters and not images. I don't know the % per page for this new specification but it does include quite a few images on the five test pages used.<br /><br />The "toner save mode", under Printer Settings - Advanced, as I've said, will save some toner though I use "improve grey" on both mono and Color Settings to make it look a little better because: some lettering can look unreadable if the website or pdf has already lightened the brightness for ink jet users and if they used a dot matrix type lettering it will not be a smooth and continuous lettering but looks like a dot matrix; these two problems together make the lettering look like it is faded out and it is just not good enough for regular reading. Thus some text pages printed using toner save will have to be reprinted for reading. The "improve grey" seems to help the lettering but I have not finished my study of this and other option setting yet.<br /><br />When you do print a full page of picture image color, even like the hp-4500-laserjet, it will really use up a LOT of toner. Since the toner life estimations are like for printing a 5 to 10% page coverage. So if you cover 100% of the page you will get maybe 5% to 10% of the cartridge life. Thus toner life will drop from 1,500 pages for the low capacity cartridges to 75 to 150 pages of full page color printing according to my rough estimate. So I use the toner save mode on color and black-&-white images for brochures which use a lot of color and pictures. Sometimes this is good enough and sometimes not for reading. Most web pages don't have a full page 100% image but include text that doesn't take much toner to print.<br /><br />Strategy:<br />Some people could use a tn-315 high capacity cartridge for black-&-white and buy color cartridges with low capacity tn-310's if they print little color and use the toner save mode.<br /><br />Save each mode (color or mono) and print quality option combinations that you use as a slightly different "preset" name. Then you can quickly switch printer setups by selecting the different preset when you print. It is easier to do than explain.<br /><br />Duplex:<br />You will love double sided pages since it saves a lot of paper and makes a less heavy load to carry when printing out longer documents especially with 20lb paper. I can't live without double-sided (duplexing) anymore.<br /><br />Quality:<br />Its image quality sharpness and color range on the printed white page are not as good as the hp-4500-laserjet but it is fine if you will take like a 10-to-15% drop in overall quality. Not a great art printer but not the worst either if you put it on Color Settings for vivid color. Also try Printer Settings - Advanced - Improve print output - improve toner fixing.<br /><br />With some print-option experimenting and good paper it is fine for color quality just a little under the old HP standard which was quite high for a business printer. If a great art inkjet printer using more than three color inks gives A+ quality, and the old HP-4500-laserjet is a B+ quality for color prints using 3 color inks, then this is a C++ or B- for color prints.  Fine for off-the-internet pictures and such research. Much better than my parent's ink jet that runs out of ink all the time. If you go in and play with the settings and use a photo type laser paper you can get decent prints for any low to mid and some higher quality digital cameras as someone remarked in another review.<br /><br />HP no longer has a laser at this price point that reviews well. Brother in my experience is the best maker for the low cost equipment where you pay just slightly more and it works much better. This is what I call light-weight-industrial-equipment because though it is built in a light weight fashion it will turn out some high counts and quality dependably. The old HP-4500 was medium-weight-industrial quality and it cost more (and was made by Cannon for HP).<br /><br />3rd Party Toner Cartridges Are Like The Wild West... dangerous.<br />When trying 3rd party ink from Abacus I had to do four 1 hour cleanups of inside toner sticky that got on rollers and everything else. This leaking toner caused almost every double-sided-page to bend the front corner edge on one side or both. Occasionally, pages started jamming, that is turning sideways and stopping the printer. Also a magenta, cyan, or yellow stripe or roundish splotches went down the edge of the page from the leaking toner. The main problem was leaking not the toner color itself which I liked a lot having a nice aliveness to it. But now I use the standard Brother cartridges not replacements.<br /><br />Toner does not leak when putting the cartridge in or taking it out. It leaks when the machine turns the roller that is built into the cartridge and then the toner pours out everywhere! Even from printing one page sometimes! Abacus was great giving my money back - thank you Abacus supplier! After 3 weeks with a broken printer due to leaking toner, are we not in love?  Due to a refund!<br /><br />So I went back to standard Brother toner cartridges which now work fine.<br /><br />The machine quit jamming and the edges quit bending but only after:<br />a complete cleaning of all rollers especially the sides of the rollers that picked up the leaking toner most. To clean the image roller drums mounted under the toner cartridges I removed the toner cartridge tray from the machine. The removal system makes you play with a lever stop-arm that blocks the tray from falling out. Hire a monkey to do this it is too strange for the human mind. Putting it back in is still stranger - hold the stop-arm up, slide the tray in just the right amount of distance, then drop the stop-arm again to let the tray go the rest of the way in. You see even in Asia they want cheaper labor so they hired an alien, one of those childish grays I'm sure, to design this. Well it does work...<br /><br />Then I removed the toner cartridges from the tray. Then I used a paper towel and warm water and tried some water-ammonia spray then got scared and quit using it. The image-roller-drums about 3/4" in diameter, four of them, one for each toner, must be clean ALL THE WAY ACROSS even where the paper doesn't touch at the left and right edges for about 1/2" area to the end of the drums. I thought probably I had ruined the image drums but after printing a few pages they started producing good prints again.<br /><br />IF A PAPER EDGE EVER BENDS OVER AGAIN: pull the toner tray out and clean the left and right edges of the rollers again with warm water on a paper towel then dry it (since the roller end can get sticky even though you don't see excess toner on it and the stickiness will grab the paper at the edge and bend the edge over especially with todays ultralight 20 lb papers).<br /><br />After cleaning I have gone through about 5 reams (2,500 pages) with only one edge bent; I cleaned it again and have not had another in 4 reams (2,000 pages) and hope will have no more. I would say the printer does NOT have paper edge bend problems unless it leaks toner and then it is fixable without much trouble. Contrast this with my HP4500 that got an unfixable jamming problem.<br /><br />When you buy a new drum tray someday this problem will quit for a while or forever probably if you use good toner. This is NOT a Brother suggested service procedure but I was desperate with my image drums putting color casts like clouds in various places on the paper. I also vacuumed it everywhere I could get a vacuum's nozzle.<br /><br />TRUST:<br />The leaking made me distrust the machine for a while but after cleaning of the drum edges that are below the toner cartridges on the drum/toner tray it began working fine again and quit bending page ends and quit jamming. What a scare!<br /><br />Trays:<br />The fold out manual paper feed tray is a mystery seeming to print on one side of a paper one time and the other side of the paper the next time so I have not figured it out even after numerous trys. I've done some envelopes with it one-at-a-time through the manual tray but doing so is a black art worse than rocket science between the software and printer options that need sorting out. You will loose some envelopes to the learning process and seemingly unexplainable variations that the software-hardware throw at you. If I was married I would assign this job to my wife and let her boast when she figured it out. Sometimes it pays to be humble.<br /><br />Both the bottom and top tray work fine without jamming and they need to be selected by the printer driver settings. FOR THE MANUAL LOAD TRAY: Figuring out what is the top and bottom and front and end of the paper is confusing and I still put the paper in wrong sometimes. Just play with the manual tray for a while like a cat does with a ball of string and you will figure it out. Good luck!<br /><br />Yes eventually it will work predictably and you will have presets that you like. Don't have a drink of go-juice before doing it; the wayfaring mind suspended in alcohol will have a hard going and might push the printer off its table top in frustration.<br /><br />Hope you are bored of reading since I am burned out on writing.<br />Good day!<br /><br />7-27-2012 UPDATE:<br />Great news: After 25,000 + pages, half of them color, half black-&-white, the drum unit says to replace BUT it does NOT force you to replace it! So apparently they let you keep printing until you decide the printing detail is below your standards. This is a GREAT feature since the drum gradually goes bad thus it is a judgment call as to when to replace it. My old HP would go about 15 to 50 percent longer until it was printing bad prints. A bad print is not a messy smear but instead more like a 1/32" line might be 2/32" in size causing a loss of picture detail and "fat" lettering.<br /><br />10-5-2012 update:<br />Started getting bent edges on right-side-leading-edge of pages again. After cleaning of image drum rollers and the belt unit it still was doing it. Finally I found that some magenta had leaked and gotten into the Fuser unit (see page 154 of the Main Users Guide for pictures). The fuser is accessed at the back cover of the unit. You pull the back over down then follow directions to flip down some small outer rollers to expose the HOT fuser rollers, two of them, lower bright orange roller and upper dark black roller. The upper one seems most hot. I turned the unit off to let it cool. The magenta toner had hardened on the upper scraping edge next to the darker fuser roller. I used a suede brush with its hard bristles and and exacto knife to loose the hardened toner that was bending the edge of the page as it came through the fuser rollers. I cleaned some toner off the lower orange fuser roller also with a paper towel. Last I blew it out with compressed air. Now I have no bent edges on the paper. Back to near perfection.;;4.0;;February 17, 2012;;39;;40;;0.975

Had to get the meeting minutes printed and mistakenly thought that documents written on my laptop using MS Works would be easily transferrable to my desktop's Word. Wrong. Those b*s*t*r*ds. So out I ran at 10:30pm to Wally's expecting to pay at least $50 for something basic. Wrong again. For $29 I almost expected it to implode after the 80 pages I needed it to print. I even bought an extra cartridge assuming the one included would just barely make it through the test page. It actually comes with full regular cartridges which was a pleasant surprise. I then expected it to at least be noisy - it wasn't at all. Lastly, I expected slow. My plan was to send the files to the printer and then go to bed so it'd all be done by morning. Truthfully, my plan wouldn't have worked anyway since the input tray only holds 50 sheets (not a deal breaker at all) but it was spitting out the pages so quickly that I stood there in utter amazement. I should explain that it has been at least 10 years since I last owned an inkjet printer. Something must've happened to print speeds in the interim because I couldn't staple them as fast as they were shooting out! Delightful. And as far as the numerous complaints about the lack of USB cable? Puhlease. I have a shoebox full of them for some reason and would have been just as annoyed if I had had to pay for yet another one. (Why do I have so many? Maybe I have all of theirs?) As a bonus, it's small enough that I'm going to start bringing it with me to the meetings so I can just print off requested documents instead of trying to remember what everyone needs and e-mailing it to them later (yeah right). How well will it deal with being lugged around? At $29 if it lasts 6 months I'll be happy. BTW, it comes with a weird tote bag as if they intend for you to lug it around. Hmmm....<br /><br />Update - As of 8/6/11 the printer is still going strong. Still receives only light use (around 80 pages/month) but works the same as the day I bought it. No regrets. If it breaks anytime soon I'll be replacing it with the same model. Everything else I've seen is too bulky to be carried around.;;4.0;;February 12, 2011;;453;;457;;0.991247

I purchased this printer because it seemed like it was a good deal.  I am a student and have to print quite a few documents and articles.  Knowing what I know now, I would have paid a little extra money to get a much better printer.  I strongly advise against this printer.  I apologize for the long review, but I hope this will be helpful to others. Here are some cons that I have run into so far:<br /><br />1.  The printer does not pick up a wireless signal from my router unless the router is sitting on top of the scanner.  I had it sitting ~ 2 feet away on a table, and it would not pick up the signal.<br /><br />2.  I usually like to print things in the "draft" quality because it saves money with ink and it's much faster.  I had an hp photosmart printer (C4180 model) before this one, and the draft quality for standard documents was just as good as the normal quality.  However, with this printer, I could barely read the draft quality; therefore, I am having to waste A LOT of ink.  In fact, the "fast draft" option for my hp printer is 100 times better than the draft option for this printer.  If my hp printer were wireless I would throw this one out and just keep using that one.<br /><br />3.  The 126 cartridge claims it will print 385 pages with black ink.  I have no idea where they got this from, because I have printed approximately 200 pages (or less) in a month, and I just had to switch out my black ink.  Basically, I'm not even half way through a ream of paper yet since I've had this printer.  This problem wouldn't be as much of an issue if the draft quality was legible.  The black ink cartridge with my hp printer would last for months.  I could usually get through close to two reams of paper (almost 1,000 pages) with my hp printer.<br /><br />4.  The printer interrupts it's current print job to make you replace an ink cartridge.  I usually try to use every bit of ink I can since all printers are notorious for giving you the low ink warning, when in reality you have plenty of ink to last you for a while longer.  I had the low ink sign for only a few days, and although the last page it printed was not the least bit faded, it would not complete the document until I changed the ink cartridge.<br /><br />5.  Because I have to print in regular quality, the printing is incredibly slow.  It often has to "take a break," so to speak, in the middle of printing a 5 page word document.<br /><br />6.  When I was attempting to set up the wireless printing for the first time, I tried to contact them through their email service, but did not get a response from them.  The next day, I called them and was able to speak to an epson employee.  However, she hung up on me before my problem was resolved.  (The problem was that the printer was not picking up a wireless signal even though the router was next to the printer).  From other reviews I have read about epson customer service employees, this is not uncommon.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1.  It has airprint capabilities for the iPad.  I have tried this a few times, and it takes probably a good 3-4 minutes to print one page from the iPad.  I don't know how quick other airprint printers are when printing from the iPad though.<br /><br />2.  It has a scanner, but so do a lot of other much better printers.<br /><br />3.  It's wireless...sometimes.<br /><br />4.  The "normal" quality printing option is good, but it consumes A LOT of ink!!;;1.0;;February 14, 2012;;41;;50;;0.82

This printer is good in some aspects, but it certainly has its limitations.  I have had this printer for roughly a week now, and I've had a chance to try it out by printing several types of documents.  I am a college student, so I print class assignments and notes.  I also print powerpoints with colorful and detailed pictures.  I haven't used the scan or fax options, and I haven't used this printer for photo-quality printing.<br /><br />First of all, this printer was easy to set up, even without a USB cord (which isn't provided, by the way).  I use the wireless function, which is nice because it keeps clutter off of my desk and it's easier for multiple computers to use the same printer.  Documents print fast, and the paper tray holds a decent amount of paper.  Obviously, since I've only had this printer for a week, I haven't run out of ink.  Supposedly, the high-capacity ink cartridges will last me for a long time.  I'm skeptical, but I have my fingers crossed.<br /><br />Now for the things I don't like.  This printer does not do automatic double-sided printing, but you can select to manually print 2-sided.  Unfortunately, it's a little inconvenient to reload the paper in the paper tray every time I want to print on the back side.  The paper tray should also have more plastic guides to hold the paper in place, because I've already had documents print crooked due to poorly aligned paper in the paper tray.  To fix this problem, I stuck some strips of cardboard in the tray to hold the stack of paper straight.  Another thing I don't like is the poor quality of the printing in the "draft" setting.  My last printer was an HP, and I always used draft printing to save ink.  Remember those powerpoint notes I print for class?  They are practically illegible if I print in the draft setting.<br /><br />Overall, this printer is a decent product.  I bought this printer on sale; I'm glad I didn't fork over $100 for it.  I don't think "great" printers actually exist, but this one does what it promises to do, without any major flaws.;;3.0;;February 27, 2012;;29;;31;;0.935484

I was surprised, thinking it should have lasted longer.<br /><br />In the past, with my HP printer, I could print and print and print, until I decided, well, its barely visible now, I better order some ink.  Or, perhaps, I had to print something that had to be very good quality, and put a new one in.<br /><br />Bottom line:  More very expensive ink to buy.  It is CRAZY to spend more on ink than the printer!  I'll be buying a different printer, because in another 3 months, I'll have spent more money on the ink.  I'll probably go back to HP, and now, every time I buy a printer, I will make sure that I GET TO DECIDE when to replace the ink.  Sorry Epson, if you thought that this scheme would make you money, you guessed wrong, at least with me.

Time to go paperless and print from iPhones. (New Years Resolutions early)<br />The first 7510 I received had to be sent back because the web functions wouldn't connect to HP's servers. After working on this for days (not joking) HP sent my case to escalations and offered to send me a new printer (very good job). The second 7510 had no issues connecting to the ePrint web servers problem fixed 2 weeks after buying the printer (YAH!)<br />Now time for the ease of use issues.<br />The software package included with this printer is lame and very basic compared to the software I have with my B209a. The major issue is scanning. My B209a has a software called HP Solution Center very nice program. It also is able to configure picture scanning options better like scanning multiple pictures in a single scan and making individual files. With the 7510 can't do that or at least I haven't found it yet. When you scan a single picture unless you specify the size it will scan the entire flatbed print area and guess who gets to do the cropping? Wrong YOU DO the software doesn't auto-crop. With the B209a cropping was done automatically. This can be a real killer when you are scanning a lot of old pictures like I need to do.<br />You also can't scan into a folder now and your scans go into a monthly folder automatically. Not even an option for this. Simple things that should be a checkbox option at least. You can scan into a folder but not a monthly folder to sort through and file later.<br />I know it sounds like complaints about little things but these are usability issues and TIME savers.<br />In summary the software or lack of good software are my problems with this. the Airprint feature and the ePrint stuff is awesome.

As soon as I saw how easy and functional it was, I had to have a printer that was capable of performing. After some extensive research and checking out many different models, I made the plunge to get this printer. We use both Macs and PC's in our home and found that it was a little difficult to get the printer setup initially with the Mac but once we set it up with the PC, it took about 15 minutes. There's also a really easy to use "ePrint" app that you can get from the Apple Store which allows you to print anything remotely from your phone. Finally, you can even setup an email address where anyone can print to your printer if they send an attachment to your email address setup for printing.<br /><br />All in all, a good printer.

Useless HP support;;My faithful old workhorse, the Laserjet 6L, toiled tirelessly for 9 years before it died recently. I was scrambling for a replacement and happily came upon this little baby. The Laserjet 1020 makes an excellent choice. It costs less than half the price of the old 6L and has better print quality to boot. Like its predecessor, it is a monochrome printer, best suited for printing text. Graphics are good enough but if graphics are your primary concern, you'd be better off with a separate colour printer. Text though is absolutely perfect (HP's strong point) - you need a magnifying glass and very meticulous scrutinising to spot any imperfections. It has a print resolution of 600x600x2 with RET to give an effective resolution of 1200 dpi. But the actual print quality outshines those of many printers boasting much higher resolutions. The 2MB memory may seem small by today's standards but it is still twice the 1MB on my old LJ-6L and I never had any trouble running out of memory even then. Like most newer printers, it connects to the PC via a USB 2.0 port. You cannot connect via a parallel printer port. It doesn't have an auto-start or auto-shutdown like the old LJ-6L but has a manual on/off switch instead. No big loss. The accompanying toner cartridge is rated at a decent 2000 pages. You can extend that quite a bit by using Economode (Draft print). The quality on HP's economode is good enough for daily personal use. The default setting on the LJ-1020 is 600dpi. To print at the higher 1200dpi or the lower Economode, you need to change the settings in the printer's properties page on your PC. Despite its relatively compact size, it is slightly larger and bulkier than the LJ-6L (14inches across cf. 12inches for the 6L).<br /><br />It installs like a breeze on both XP and Vista. The drivers are not Vista certified but they work without a hitch. It took barely 10 minutes from software installation to printing out the test page. (Note: Follow HP's advice and install the software first, and only then connect the printer).<br /><br />After that pleasant initial experience, my nightmare began. I have older systems with Win ME and 98SE installed, which depended on the old LJ-6L for printing. Despite HP's claim that this printer will work on Win ME and 98SE, I was unable to have it work on either. After 5 evenings of fruitless troubleshooting, I finally caved in and called HP tech-support (India). The Indian staff were as always exceedingly polite but they insisted that the printer wouldn't work on either ME or 98SE. As they said, "HP no longer supports installation on ME or 98SE". They advised me to just install it on the new XP or Vista machine. I was crushed but I carried on tinkering. I finally got it to print on not only the ME and 98SE machines but even on a system with Win98 (First Edition) - supposedly unsupported. The trouble was in the USB connection. On the older machines I had to plug the printer into the old USB 1.0 ports, instead of the newer 2.0 ports I had added on later. On the 2.0 port it simply wouldn't print, but on the 1.0 port it autodetected and printed flawlessly. The 2.0 ports are fully functional as I use them to connect the old machines to external backup disks, so I have no idea why the printer simply can't use them. On the new XP and Vista machine, the printer was happy enough to print via the USB 2.0 port.<br /><br />Incredibly, I found that the LJ-1020 even works on Linux which is explicitly NOT supported by HP (HP does not provide Linux drivers). I tried using it on the latest version of Ubuntu Linux (Feisty Fawn). You need to search for and download a third-party driver called foo2zjs (Google it). It's provided free by some kind soul in the open-source community. You need to be reasonably familiar with Linux to tweak it. There's help at the author's homepage. It has bugs but at least it prints, which is more than can be said for HP's own miserable efforts. (Note: Feisty Fawn contains an early version of foo2zjs but get the latest version from the author's website.)<br /><br />My printer came packaged with the latest drivers as well as the USB cable (HP finally woke up to customer complaints regarding the absence of the USB cable in previous releases). The reason the Laserjet 1020 is so cheap, is because, like most things nowadays, it is "Made in China". The accompanying toner cartridge is "Made in Japan" and the CD-ROM is "Made in Singapore". The manufacturing quality is good enough. No complaints. Especially at this price. The quick-setup guide is a single-sheet foldout - simple, easy to understand pictures. Even a child could set this up. For those who like ploughing through technical stuff, there is the full and very detailed 118-page manual in pdf format on the accompanying CD-ROM. It includes troubleshooting tips on all sorts of potential problems and how to best avoid them. It also tells you how to open up the printer, not only to clean, but also to replace worn-out moving parts like the "pickup roller" and the "separation pad". I take this to mean that HP expects its printer to last a very long time (In 9 years, I never had to change anything on my old 6L except for the toner cartridge). All in all, aside from the disappointing and wholly misleading tech-support, this was an excellent buy. I expect as many years of unfailing service from this little printer as from its venerable predecessor.<br /><br />PS: A note on HP repair services. When my old Laserjet 6L stopped working, I took it straight to the HP repair centre. I fully expected to have it repaired and working again within a week or so. It took HP more than 2 weeks to get back to me with the curt and dismissive claim that it was "unrepairable" - "too old to repair" - "why don't you buy a new one?". On further questioning, I found out that it could, in fact be repaired (the problem was a defective transformer) but at a price. They then quoted me the extraordinary estimate of just over $130. Does it cost $130 to replace a defective transformer? I doubt it. It may seem odd to want to repair something in this throwaway-age, but I happen to be someone who values quality and durability and fully expects products to last a lifetime. Was this just HP's ploy to get loyal customers to buy new HP products? If they think they are gaining business this way, they are sadly mistaken. Customer loyalty is earned when a company stands by its product to the end and not treat it as throwaway junk. If it weren't for the high quality printouts HP laser-printers are justifiably famous for, I would have shunned HP forever based on their so-called "support" service. HP's "support" could do with a lot of improvement if it hopes to even begin to match the quality of its products.;;4.0;;July 22, 2007;;22;;22;;1.0

One thing I have noticed is that this printer tends to "choke" after the third print command (that is the third thing you want to print from a stop). This happens more than inkjet that you are comparing this to. Example: You are trying to find the best print off on a project. You only adjust the project, not the printer.<br />It's a common practice, & the laser is trying to adjust itself to the new task. It just chokes & comes up with an error. So you need to press clear & let the printer try again.<br />It's more of an inconvenience really, as is anything that stops your work flow.<br /><br />Additionally paper changes as well as ink adjustments cause it to stop more than I've had in the past, with other printers. This being based on inkjets as well as black only lasers. It's not a reason not to buy it, just something to keep in mind. If that totally annoys you, than maybe you should take that into consideration.<br /><br />There is quite alot to say about this printer.<br />Starting with the 19 steps to installation. Actually there are 21, it doesn't mention closing the open panels it had you open.<br /><br />Don't be daunted by that, this thing is a sweetheart.<br /><br />From the box, it will take about thirty minutes to print (about). It has to warm up the first time (think charging the battery for the first time). But after that, it's fast.<br /><br />I will say this. This is a laser printer, not inkjet. This means laser paper (for one thing). It will print on regular paper, BUT that may ruin the drum. The quality is 1200X600, which is quite nice. Not photo, but it isn't made for that. Also, this isn't for lower versions of OS. XP & above.<br />Toner costs more than ink, but doesn't dry out either. You can see by the other reviews here that the replacements are quite costly. But we've been paying HP & Epson for years his way.<br />Also, toner has more per cartridge, so you'll pay a bit more. More than the unit itself isn't great, except that you now can easily afford a color laser (won't run when wet) printer.<br /><br />Konica is an old reliable copier/photostat (etc) company. They have been around quite some time. I have used their copiers many times & have liked the results. Minolta has been around too (think camera), & in the copier biz as well. I had an old Z something years ago that was great.<br />So with that, I'm happy they offer something for in home, especially if you print less than 35,000 copies per month. No, your inkjet doesn't have that.<br /><br />So it's easy to use, prints real fast, needs a USB cable (don't they all?) & looks good. Also, this is a large printer. Think, bread machine. It does need clearance for air.<br />It powers down pretty fast (but I usually just turn it off anyhow), & powers up just as well.<br />It is noisy, so keep that in mind. It sounds like any other laser printer. Oh, just a tip. Don't go poking around inside, these things are hot!! It has a warning on it & operates at around 380 degrees F.<br /><br />I saw that someone had a tough time closing the paper paths, I don't know why? They just fold closed.<br /><br />There are a few firmware updates on their site. Review them & see if you need or want them. I believe the "ejecting the cartridge when empty" is a good one.<br /><br />One Year update: One thing I do want to add is that some areas of printing looks like it has pits in it. It doesn't take away from the print, but up close it does look odd. I'm not sure why it does that, but it does. It does this on plain paper or specialty paper. It may be what lasers do for images, I don't know. I've not had that issue with my mono HP when I printed B&W shots. Just thought I'd let you know.<br />Additionally, the toner to ink jet ink ratio is good. If some of you were confused. Printing at about 95% coverage for a toner is about 800 sheets for 75 bucks. Where ink jet is 100 sheets for 18 bucks (144.00/800). No, the toner doesn't dry out like ink. Also, keep in mind you get starter toner cartridges, which should last about 100 odd sheets of printing. But I'm well into 300 sheets on the color starter, where black emptied first. Still a great printer.;;4.0;;January 4, 2010;;12;;15;;0.8

We purchased the Canon PIXMA MP560 printer for $85 (free shipping) on Amazon, and comparing the price to other retailers online (and the retail price), it was no contest.<br /><br />This printer has some features that you may already know of via the product description page, but I'd like to elaborate on some of these features.<br />Thoughts out of the box:<br />-The MP560 has a folding LCD screen that covers the function buttons.  The screen is not too large, but it does seem to have large enough text (and a simple GUI) to work well for novice printer users.  There are not too many buttons, and they're large, well-marked, and simple enough for anyone to recognize.<br />-The printer has a lower paper tray (for regular inkjet/copier paper) and an upper vertical tray (for thicker photo paper and other things).  The vertical tray has an automatic two-sided width adjustment/alignment, so any size paper is aligned to the proper position every time (and the thickness is adjustable from maximum printing width of the printer, down to only an inch or so).<br />-The basic instruction manual is printed on paper, and easily guided me through the process of installation of the print head/ink, paper, software, and wireless network capability.  This guide has simple words and illustrations, though it does not include every detail of the printer's operations (the more complex instruction/user manual is electronic, and is installed with the printer software).  There is a Network Troubleshooting guide, as well, that seems to be rather detailed (though unnecessary in my case).  The printer comes with a sample pack of 4"x6" photo paper, which we immediately tested (and it passed the test with flying colors).  There's other throw-away junk included, but nothing that surprising.<br />-The printer is clearly labeled so as to make it simple to place cartridges in the right location, once the print head is installed.<br />-The fact that the MP560 has multiple single-color ink cartridges may seem expensive at first, but with tri-color cartridge printers, we would always seem to run out of a single color much faster than other colors... so we were wasting a good amount of ink each and every time we replaced a cartridge.  This printer seems to have ink cartridges that would be easier to refill than some other cartridges, as well.<br /><br />After powering it on:<br />-It was EFFORTLESS to set up the MP560 on our wireless network.  It quickly detected the network (our router is on another floor in the house, on the other side of the house), and it still had a good quality signal, and it only took a few minutes (and only a couple pushes of a button... plus entering our internet security key) before the printer was connected.  There is a rotating pad (similar to an IPod) on the printer that lets you select any security codes you may have (and navigate through the GUI)... so it may take awhile if one has an alphanumeric password, but it was rather quick for a numeric 8-key code.  Heck, my mom is not too familiar with computers, and I have no doubts that she could have set up this printer with the network.<br />-The printer comes with easy to use software (again, in Vista), though it does take a few minutes for the software to install itself on a PC.  The basic instruction manual makes it rather easy to install everything, whether using Windows or Mac.  Once installed, the printer is rather effortlessly found (remember to have attached the printer to the wireless network), and before you know it, you're ready to print.<br />-The printer has a laser ink level meter for every cartridge, and it can be displayed on the computer and on the 2" LCD screen on the printer (actually, pressing one button on the "Home" screen will allow you to see each ink level).  So far, it does not appear as if this printer over-uses ink... in fact, printing on glossy photo paper seems to suggest there's less "gunk" on the paper than some other printers, perhaps due to the finer ink jets this printer allegedly uses.<br /><br />Using the printer for the first time:<br />-The printer and software actually WORK WELL with Windows Vista!<br />-The printer does take a few seconds to warm up, but after the first print job, it seems to be much faster.<br />-The MP560 didn't have a single problem feeding thicker photo paper.<br />-The quality of printed pictures is very good, showing very tight pixels even on plain paper.  Photo paper shows an excellent picture quality, and the software included with the printer makes it effortless to print photos with certain photo papers... no need to change printer settings manually.<br />-The scanner/copier seems to produce quality pictures, although this isn't the fastest, nor the quietest, copier I've seen in a multi-use printer.<br />-The Duplex printing feature is a great thing to have in a lower-cost home printer, as few documents are of an official, legal nature, hence there's no need for one-sided printing.  It gets to be inconvenient to flip the pages by hand each and every time one wants to print on both sides of a piece of paper, so it is great to find a lower-cost printer that has this feature.  This printer does not print internally, it prints on one side and extracts the page, then gathers the page back inside the printer and prints on the other side, so I don't know how well Duplex printing would work on thicker media such as fabrics.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great printer so far.  It beats anything I've ever owned, in terms of print quality and functionality, and I'd say it's a pretty good value to boot.  Mom is certainly happy about this printer, and she's going to test it with some of her crafts... let's see how it stands up to the test of time when she puts it to use.;;5.0;;October 22, 2009;;382;;388;;0.984536

Finally a company has the %&lls to break away from the pack. Basically to make a long story short, I ordered this from Amazon, even though it says ships in 3 to 4 months ( at the time I ordered), it still shipped the very next day. Now I see it is in stock. I pull it out of the box and set the whole printer up with my computer and wireless in about 30 mins. Super easy! It is a very quiet printer, looks great and user friendly. The best part was the set up of the wireless, which after downloading the software for the printer onto your computer, you then turn on your Kodak printer, it searches for all the wireless signals available in and around your house, just like your laptop. you then see the list, pick yours, and you are wireless and off to the races! Done! The printer has worked perfectly for me for about 2 months now. Great quality, and I have done a ton of colorful labels as well. THAT'S NOT THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS PRINTER! What is the biggest complaint about printers, all brands....INK right? The printer companies love to gouge us all on the ink$$. Well Kodak has broken out of the pack and want's to carve out a quality niche for themselves. Their ink is the cheapest in the industry. Not only that but the printer came with a FULL, yes you read right, a FULL set of ink cartridges, not the usual half full scheme. I know that because the printer utility shows me a colored diagram of the ink levels and they were full from the beginning, and I have printed a lot so far and am only half way through the ink according to the diagram. Also, when i went into the the big office supply store to get more ink, I was standing there trying to remember the model number correctly so i could then buy the right ink cartridge. The employee asked if she could help and then told me don't worry about the type of printer, ALL Kodak's printers take the SAME! ink cartridge. Wow! That is simple and easy. And the best part.. an entire color cartridge with a separate black cartridge in the same box, cost me only $24 total!. That's it! Yes! Finally.<br />I originally went out and bought the typical popular brand name HP printer and took it home. Then I read the reviews...not good. So I took it back, having not even opened the box, and then spent hours reviewing and looking up printers, but one thing sat in the back of my mind. I had asked the printer salesman what printer he would buy and he walks me right to the Kodak printers and said these ones, good printer and the cheapest ink. He said he just bought one for himself. That's what made me finally look up Kodak printers. I really liked the brand new line of Kodak printers that was just coming out over these last several months. It's obvious that when Kodak decided to to break away from the pack with cheaper ink, they then redesigned there entire printer line and came up with a terrific printer with a great modern look, user friendly and easy to set up. Thank you Kodak! Give one of these printers a try everyone. Give up paying an arm and leg for ink and get a great printer to boot! PS - Only 4 our to 5 stars because I have only had the printer for two months. It will have to earn that last star over time. :);;4.0;;May 29, 2010;;147;;151;;0.97351

And this Brother product did it all.  Since I previously had a Brother printer I was confident in the quality.  All things worked (including fax forward to email) just as the product description suggests.  However, every thing it prints CURLS. Color or black & white it CURLS.  Any kind of paper CURLS.  Depending on the weight of the paper, the curl can be 3/4" to 1.5" high on the top and bottom of the page.  After calling Brother technical support (which was great), they advised me to set the printer setter to "reduce paper curl."  AHH HA! We thought that was it. Unfortunately that and changing some internal user settings like "roller pressure" and alike did not make any difference.  Then Brother thought it could be a "fusion" roller overheating so they sent one over night and had a Pitney Bowes service technician (who they contract with) to install the new fusion roller.  You guessed it, the paper was curling just the same.  Then a funny thing happened, the Pitney Bowes tech called Brother support from our office and they told him that unfortunately, it was a characteristic of this new model. It's now on it's way back to AMAZON.  We've replaced it with a Cannon MF 9220CDN.

Going through all the steps people have come up with to make it work, it will still only work correctly about %25 of the time.  The rest of the time it won't recognize the scanner, but it will recognize the printer.  Or suddenly it will reverse itself and recognize the scanner but not the printer.  Or it will claim it recognizes both but when you try to print something or use the scanner, it won't respond at all.  Or it will work fine until you shut it off or turn off your computer, then next time you turn them back on to use them (even if it's only an hour or two later) it no longer works or responds. Or you have to reset your wireless LAN settings.  Or you have to delete the printer/scanner from the printer preferences, then try to re-add them (but inevitably then the computer doesn't recognize them at all, so you can't add anything).  All in all, it's just not worth it and after trying everybody's nifty little tricks and techniques to make it work, it will still end up being more of a large paperweight on your desk, rather than a useful piece of equipment.

I was able to get rid of my old fax machine and my temperamental HP wide format inkjet and combine them into one machine, freeing up much needed space in my office.  Free up space, it most certainly did, but the benefits of owning this frustrating piece of technology ends there.<br /><br />As for large format printing, this puppy sure handles paper up to 13x19, POORLY. If you're lucky enough to get the paper to feed without jamming or trying to grab ten sheets at once, it usually feeds crooked and prints everything on the page at an angle. Then, when it gets to the bottom of the page, it freaks out and tries to suck back the freshly printed page back into the printer for some reason. At best, this rips the bottom of the page. At worst, it feeds the page back in so far as to jam the print heads that are still flying back and forth. Printing 13x19 is a great function, but only if it works.  This machine literally has a 10% success rate with large format paper.<br /><br />Printing on regular sized paper can be frustrating as well, as this printer likes to feed multiple sheets at once, or none at all. Reposition the paper in the tray, and it may then print or jam up on you. Depends on its mood. Trying to print wirelessly? Sure it has the function, but you will wait FOREVER for this thing to start printing a page. When it does finish printing, each page is shot out the front of this thing like a clown being shot out of a cannon at the Circus.  Forget to flip up that paper tray "stop" at the end of the tray and you'll end up with freshly printed pages all over the floor of your office.<br /><br />Copying, Scanning, and Faxing is handled fairly well, except for the fact that you have to use the touch screen interface to enter the numbers.  Another exercise in frustration.  The touchscreen key-pad is really fussy and either doesn't respond to your touch at all or responds by entering two or three numbers rather than just the one you're trying to press. Frustrating. Once you get the number entered, faxes go through as expected, though the paper feeder is louder than any other I've heard anywhere.<br /><br />If you can actually get this thing to print a page correctly, the print quality is quite nice, as expected.  However getting this thing to work on a regular basis over the last year of having it has been an exercise in frustration.  I am writing this while researching a replacement for this machine. Can't wait for the day I get to throw it on the trash heap.  I generally like HP printers, but this one is a total dud.;;1.0;;February 22, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

I then Googled a bit and found out that users were having success with the LJ 1022 drivers (as Amazon Lover indicates here) so I tried these and it worked like a charm.

Connected to my secured wifi with no hassle, and is able to reconnect and is almost seamless that the device is not physically connected to my desktop, helps also because I have more than one pc.<br /><br />But... I bought this to replace my aged Canon MP 150, while the biggest selling point for me was the auto-feeder, with my obsession over scanning and maintaining even remotely important paper, I thought it would be great to easily scan all the paper without having to scan them page by page, alas, lesson learnt, this will scan only one side of the page using the adf, thus if you paper is printed on both sides, which it will be in most cases nowadays, you are back to page by page manual scanning.<br /><br />Also, I notice the best quality scanning results are not even comparable to the ones Canon did, Canon did a far better job, to the extent for the first slightly colored page scanned I had to go back to check if it was scanning in grayscale. Now I wonder if I should still keep the Canon to do the really important paper like the certificates.<br /><br />Perhaps not the best decision for me given my use pattern and priorities, I wanted to write this review to share my thoughts about this to help others.

Since I've only had the printer for a month I cannot comment on ink usage since I use the printer once or twice a week. So far the printer has worked well. I have a Wireless network setup (802.11 b/g/n) and the printer connects without any problems to both desktops on my network. I was also able to connect the printer via WEP (128-bit) and WPA-PSK/WPA-PSK2 Personal. I found that you will need a link strength of 50% or more and signal strength close to 70% for a smooth run on print and scan via the wireless network. I love that the scan can be setup directly on the printer for you to send to the computer as PDF/image. This really cuts down on my time to convert to PDF which is a very nice feature. Standard Printing good quality - better than my old HP PSC 1210xi. I particularly like how the MP560 can print individual photos rather than letter size photo paper (requiring you to cut out). The borderless printing is VERY NICE - I haven't seen any issues with bleeding or off colors (using a canon high gloss paper). The power cord is slim and good length - no bulky adapter to deal with, especially when you have a power strip that has been taken up by other large adapters. As I mentioned the ink I cannot comment on at the moment for usage but the installation of print head and cartridges was very simple - just follow the directions to avoid any damage. Sorry this isn't very technical but I figured I'd just put a comment up for a nice wireless printer at a good price. I didn't see any other reviews but wanted to point this one out as a good printer.

Or, if it doesn't jam, the envelopes come out looking crooked. I called tech support twice, and first they told me that they can't help me because it's not their problem that it's printing crooked, but a problem with the software...That, of course, wasn't true because I was using Word, which is good with envelopes. The next time I called they told me that the envelopes I am using are too thick, which is also total garbage because I was using the most standard #10 envelopes in the world! They were just totally unhelpful!<br /><br />If you don't plan on printing envelopes, or calling tech support, it's a very nice machine.;;2.0;;May 31, 2006;;18;;21;;0.857143

It seemed like every other time I wanted to receive a fax or make a copy, I would have to replace the $25 ink cartridge again.<br /><br />This fax machine makes copies much more quickly (and cheaply, and with better quality) than the old fax. It holds about twice as much paper. You can also schedule faxes to be sent later, and to multiple recipients.<br /><br />One more advantage of this machine is that you can hook it up to a computer through USB and use it as a normal laser printer. I tried it, and it works great, and FAST compared to my HP Deskjet.<br /><br />If you're concerned about junk faxes wasting money on ink, or if you want ot make a lot of copies, or if you need both a printer and a fax machine and want to save money by buying just one, this machine is a very good investment.;;5.0;;April 9, 2006;;65;;68;;0.955882

It does look a bit more like one of HP's cheapie inkjet or photo printers than the serious B&W laser workhorse that it is.<br /><br />It's chintzy-appearing plastic paper tray sticking out of the front and it's very inexpensive price (...) belies its rather impressive capabilities as a reasonably "heavy duty" home office or small business printer.<br /><br />I'm a full-time, home-based medical transcriptionist. My printer output averages 5,000-7,500 pages a month -- a much higher output demand than most home offices and others who have posted reviews here. Because I work on production, I absolutely require a reliable laser printer.<br /><br />The reason that I bought the HP 1300 was because a Brother HL-5140 I had recently purchased turned out to be entirely unsatisfactory after only a couple months of use (it's poorly designed and plagued with paper jams). I knew I should have stuck with HP in the first place.<br /><br />I have now used the HP 1300 for about a month and printed more than 5,000 pages without a single glitch or paper jam. Yes, I am very careful about how I handle the paper I put into the printer, but I think that's pretty amazing. And after printing more than 5,000 pages with the small-capacity 13A toner cartridge (which is rated at 2,500 pages), I still have 25% of the toner left.<br /><br />Over the past years I have used LaserJet 4L and 6P models extensively. The only differences I can discern between them and the current printer is that he HP 1300 is quieter and a whole lot faster. And, contrary to the observations of some reviewers here, I have found the print quality among all three to be consistenly excellent.<br /><br />I don't give a 5-star rating easily, but the HP 1300 has earned it.<br /><br />THE PROS:<br /><br />1.  Initial setup (at least for me, using a parallel port connection with both DOS and Windows drivers) was incredibly quick and simple. Anyone who has trouble installing this printer (as mentioned in a couple of other reviews here) probably didn't bother to read the instructions.<br /><br />2.  I found the online documentation to be quite adequate, and the online "Toolbox" is an extremely useful tool for both customizing the printer and monitoring its current status.<br /><br />3.  If output speed is what you're looking for, the HP 1300 delivers with HP's "instant-on fuser technology." No more waiting for the laser printer to warm up between jobs. For me, this "first page out" time is as important as the rated print speed.<br /><br />4.  Paper of all kinds, including envelopes, run through it without any problems, and the print quality is excellent.<br /><br />5.  It's about as quiet as any laser printer I've ever used.<br /><br />6.  The HP 1300 appears to be VERY well designed and built for very hard use. Changing the toner cartridge couldn't be easier.<br /><br />THE CONS:<br /><br />1.  I remains to be seen if the HP 1300 will stand up to my very rigorous use as well as my old LaserJet 6P, which has over 120,000 pages through it and is still going strong.<br /><br />2.  As noted by another reviewer, like nearly all laser printers, it does tend to curl the top and bottom edges of the printed pages a bit sometimes, which can be a bit annoying. However, this characteristic is common to nearly all laser printers, and it depends a lot on temperature, humidity, and the type of paper you're using.<br /><br />All in all, an absolutely fantastic, reasonably heavy-duty printer, and a terrific bargain for(...).<br /><br />Bob;;5.0;;September 4, 2004;;24;;24;;1.0

I am completely amazed that I am able to configure it as easily as I have been able to on multiple laptops, desktops and macs, at home and at my office. At home, I have a pretty jacked up network that has a wireless leg on it, and I'm able to "see" the wireless printer from my wired desktop machine. Still not quite sure how that's working, and I'm a computer engineer.<br /><br />If you are replacing your toners for the first time in your machine, remember this tip before you replace them. Brother toners have a false end of life message programmed in based on a page count rather than toner usage, and it is often highly conservative (about 50% more toner left in my experience when it says it is time to replace). So, I have found this information, which works for several of the Brother machines, not just the MFC 9970 CDW, although with slightly different commands:<br /><br />"We have a MFC-9460CDN at my office and have been on average going through a full set of 4 cartridges every month. I was always very suspicious of this, as seriously all 4 at once? we very rarely print in colour and haven't been getting anywhere near the 6000+ pages claimed by the box, add to this that the 'empty' cartridges weight almost the same as the new one? and cost approx $600 a set. I call shenanigans.<br /><br />So today the print locks up and refuses to print with the Toner End Life message and corona reset required. I play the game and replace the cartridges, with genuine Brother (my boss refuses to buy compatible or referbs/remanus. Warning won't go away.... on to the intewebs with me!<br /><br />I discovered this (below is my updated version):<br /><br />1.With the machine turned on, open the toner access main door (front cover where you replace the cartridges). You will get a "Cover is Open" message on the LCD.<br />2. For a 9460, Press the "Clear/Back" button (on the 9970CDW you press the #1 button), you will be taken to the toner "Reset Menu"<br />You can now scroll through the reset options for the printer's toner cartridges:<br /><br />K.TNR-STD - Black - Standard<br />K.TNR-HC - Black - High Capacity<br />K.TNR-S.HC - Black - Super High Capacity<br />C.TNR-STD - Cyan - Standard<br />C.TNR-HC - Cyan - High Capacity<br />C.TNR-S.HC - Cyan - Super High Capacity<br />M.TNR-STD - Magenta - Standard<br />M.TNR-HC - Magenta - High Capacity<br />M.TNR-S.HC - Magenta - Super High Capacity<br />Y.TNR-STD - Yellow - Standard<br />Y.TNR-HC - Yellow - High Capacity<br />Y.TNR-S.HC - Yellow - Super High Capacity<br /><br />3.Scroll to the colour and cartridge size you have and press OK. (personally I use S.HC no matter what type of cartridge I've installed, as it is just the page counts before it tells you it is empty)<br />4.Press "1&#8243; to reset.<br />5.Menu will clear back to the 'Cover Open' screen after a couple of seconds.<br />6.Each cartridge must be reset individually, simply repeat Steps 2 to 5 for each cartridge you need/want to reset.<br />7.Once you've reset all the cartridges simply close the door.<br /><br />NOTE: Keep an eye on the printouts when they start to gray/fade out or you get hazing on the page you will need to replace the cartridge. Be extra careful when you do as toner is more likely to go everywhere with reset cartridges."<br /><br />This information was copied from a website that is being edited out, so I'll be creative: fixyourownprinter d o t com slash forums slash laser slash 39806.

There are issues where the printer will not print from Microsoft Office on the Mac (but those are are driver issues which will be eventually resolved). I hate feeling cheated, and I am very displeased that HP discontinued the other (full-size toner) printer line without telling the consumer they were getting only half as much for effectively the same price.

Even the top rated printers from Consumer Reports had multiple negative comments on Amazon - some had enough that I was scared off. I settled on the HP Photosmart 5510 after looking it over at a local retailer.<br /><br />A car owner would never think of swearing off his or her make of car over a flat tire - but printer buyers experiencing a paper jam seem to equate the event with a poor product. I realize that any manufacturer can turn out an occasional lemon. My 5510 Wireless has been a joy - particularly the wireless aspect that allows printing from another room.<br /><br />I agree with the featured reviewer that this printer is effortless to connect (in fact, the wireless printer requires nothing more than the power plug!). The cartridges are a snap (literally) to install. I'm fairly certain it was up and printing in under fifteen minutes, and I actually read the brief instructions. I should note that I already had a wireless router in place before installing the printer.<br /><br />Unlike the Epson I replaced, the starter cartridges are still printing after nearly half a ream of paper - much of the printing in color. The colors are crisp and bright, even on the normal setting. I'll step up the quality when I need it. I like the idea of separate color cartridges rather than having to buy a tri-color when only one color is out as my earlier HP required.<br /><br />I'm adding this review simply to assure prospective buyers that the HP Photosmart 5510 has more than satisfied my expectations, and that I'd buy it again, even if it cost more than I paid.

In no particular order:<br /><br />>Make certain, as other reviews have correctly noted, that if you want 'all' the bells and whistles of the HP 8500A, get the 'Premium' edition, not the Standard or the Plus edition.  Other reviews cover the differences better than I want to spend the time in doing so.<br /><br />>Take a friend with you.  The box this thing comes in is HUGE.  And awkward.  It's not terribly heavy (though it easily goes 35-40 pounds in the box) but the box is a testament to big, awkward and the carry handles are 'offset' so there really isn't an easy way to carry this thing home unless you have space in the car and a basketball players arm spread.<br /><br />>While not occupying really more of a footprint than any other AIO printer, this one with the second paper tray is very tall.  So give yourself plenty of room on where you plan to place it.<br /><br />>Shame, shame and another shame on HP for giving you only a simple 'Get Started diagram' (which isn't too bad but covers ONLY how to get started ONLY).  And a fax book.  They note that the manuals and such are installed during installation but come on; how hard can it be to include a printed manual for the darned thing?<br /><br />>You'll first unpack all of the shipping stuff and there is a TON of it.  Foam packing, tape, paper, more tape, and tons of that static cling stuff.  The pile after you are done will amaze you.  And you'll keep on finding more even after it's assembled.  I'm staggered by how much protective stuff is on this printer but say that in a good way...better to be safe than damaged.  But it shows up EVERYWHERE.  Allow 15 minutes just to find the shipping protection!<br /><br />>The initial calibration is mind numbingly long...20 minutes.  And you cannot make it shorter either.<br /><br />>You'll basically do the following (in order):  Arrive home, unpack everything, take off all shipping protection, install the rear paper guide, install the bottom second feeder, install the print heads and then the ink tanks.  Then power it up and WAIT for calibration.<br /><br />>While it's calibrating, you hook up a USB cable to the printer and install the MAC software.  Straight-forward and no issues there (thank you HP for Mac support!).  The Mac OS/X software will install before the printer finishes calibrating but only by about 5 minutes.<br /><br />>You'll be asked when everything is done calibrating and software installed if you want to run it wirelessly.  Very easy here again, it will recognize your wireless network and encryption type.  All you do is enter a password.<br /><br />>Another SHAME for HP because at this point you're done with the installation.  But will you have the Internet-enabled APPS working?  Nope.  Will you have the ability to e-print your iPhone's emails yet?  Nope.  At this point, I guess HP is figuring you're finished with the installation but you're not.  You'll need to do the following (at least this is what worked like a charm for me):<br /><br />1--Make certain everything is finished.  At this point, you WILL have the printer speaking to your Mac network, wirelessly (and wired if you chose that) via Bonjour.  Eject the HP software installation disk.<br />2--Turn OFF the printer.  Turn it back ON.  At this point, mine went and connected to my wireless network and found an UPDATE and asked me if I wanted to apply it.  I chose YES.  After I did this, I had new icons on the printer panel, including those needed to install the APPS and other stuff necessary to e-print.<br />3--Go to your Mac and click the HP Utility icon which should have been installed on your dock.  From it you can do all the e-print setup, HP Marketsplash stuff (very rudimentary but some like it) and other setup stuff you couldn't do when the printer was just being installed.<br /><br />E-print from my iPhone was my entire reason for buying this printer.  I just needed a quick way to print emails from my phone and this thing works like a charm.  All it does is forward your email to the printer's internal email but it works fantastic.<br /><br />I gave the printer, overall, three stars because it's really a four star product with a two star (at BEST) setup routine.  Windows users may get better mileage on the install but I just outlined EXACTLY what I had to do on a Mac to get it running.  It's stable, fairly quick, slightly noisy, BIG but it does work.  The APPS are snoozers, far less than you can do on an iPhone, but the two sided copying and scanning plus the ability to email and print from the iPhone make it worthwhile, at least in my opinion.;;3.0;;March 26, 2011;;22;;22;;1.0

The user guide for the Mac was basically worthless in that regard.  The dialog boxes in the guide were NOT the dialog boxes appearing on my screen. However, thanks to Epson's great customer support, we found the settings, and were able to make the transition to duplex printing.  We have only printed "test" pages to this point, which are crisp and clear.  It is not as fast as our previous HP model, but the print is more crisp.<br /><br />My suggestion for the Apple folks who purchase this printer: have patience, and err on the side of a quick initial call to customer support.  This will help alleviate some frustration at not being able to match what you are viewing, with what the user guide is telling you.<br /><br />One drawback, if you have been an Apple person for any length of time... setting this baby up will bring flashbacks to your Windows days!  Scary!!  :)<br /><br />(I removed one star for the glitz prone set-up for the Mac)  I really do not understand how companies like Epson can not grasp, that we consumers like to take it out of the box, plug it in, and have it work (those last three words should be all caps!).;;4.0;;May 22, 2012;;4;;5;;0.8

It was on sale at OfficeMax and I wanted it pronto.  My Canon MX860 died.  I liked that printer/aio but it was slow and ran through ink.  died after 2.5 years.  I was a little worried about Mac compatability especially with Lion.<br /><br />This Brother set up to print in 10 minutes using Bonjour and my Time Capsule. 10 more minutes to set up fax completely with phone numbers installed, etc.  I haven't tried scanning. Runs perfect wirelessly through TC with a 10.7 MBP, and a 10.6 MB, and with USB to a 10.4 G3 ibook (no AP card) !<br /><br />very very fast. holds a ream of paper. great print quality. don't know why I wasted my time with ink jets all those years.<br /><br />p.s. I did not go through the set-up in the "quick set-up" guide for a network.  Just "add a printer" on your Mac.  It will recognize the printer and ask you if you want the driver installed.  It will do all that set-up for you.  Only for the G3 laptop did I have to search google for the driver and download.<br /><br />so it may be too early to tell, but I will report back after I set up scanning and see how it performs.<br /><br />and the fan is a bit loud, but not a deal breaker.;;5.0;;October 30, 2011;;19;;20;;0.95

Note that Canon calls this a copier, not a printer.  Thus, when you call Canon or search its site for help/technical support, make sure you select the "Copier" category.<br /><br />This ImageCLASS MF4350d has been in the market for a while but no one reports this problem: up to this moment of writing this review, the machine cannot scan a document by using its own START button.  Everything must be scanned via the software "Toolbox" from the computer.<br /><br />I bought it a few days ago.  I called Canon 1-800 for help but it was useless.  Then I went back to the store and tried their demo machine; it has the same problem.  Whenever I push the START button on the machine for scanning, there is always a beeping sound as a return but the LCD doesn't show any error - it always indicates "Scanning Mode."  So I called Canon again to go over the story.  Finally they admitted the problem and said that they are aware of this issue; their engineers are working on the new firmware to fix this.  However it won't be soon.  The new firmware may be possibly released next month but could be later.  I also wrote an email to Canon support to confirm this information one more time, besides their verbal confirmation over the phone.<br /><br />In addition, the scanning has no detection senor.  Thus, the scanned document (scanned from the computer) will go as large as the paper size, which is usually the Letter/A4 size depending on your settings.  The scanned document will NOT be resized automatically according to the actual object(s).  It is different from its ink jet printers, which usually detect the size of the document or photo and then resize automatically.<br /><br />If scanning a document directly from the machine's START button is important to you, you should wait to buy until the new firmware comes.  If resizing the document or photo automatically is important to you, this copier or printer is not for you; you may consider others or Canon ink jet type printer.  After all, this all-in-on laser printer is classified a copier internally by Canon.;;3.0;;December 17, 2008;;165;;185;;0.891892

Plus some.;;I originally left a 1 star review after the paper jammed while doing a task at night with the Mrs on my back and finding the Samsung Support website somewhat lacking. (Nothing on jams, support only available via phone, which is only up to 9pm....) So I vented some venom. I can't blame it on Grandpa's cough syrup as we haven't touched the stuff. Lately. The printer is only 2 months old so I was extra upset.<br /><br />In the cool light of day I then called Samsung. I didn't have to wait too long on hold. Two minutes maybe. I got a nice young fella, probably recently out of the service based on the "yes sir" and "no sir"s liberally sprinkled in the conversation. He was in South Carolina, so at least the customer service is here in the U.S. (If it's not and this was just a made up persona from folks in India, let me tell ya - they're getting real good, then!!)<br /><br />He took his time listening to my symptoms and checking the notes they have on their end to help with jams and he had some basic advice to make sure that all old jams were removed and that any excess dirt was removed from any rollers. It turns out I did have some paper still stuck way up top. You certainly can see things better when the unit is all opened up in front of you and you're not standing up hulking over it in the shadows trying to see if anything's there (I could of swore I got all the junk out last night.) And not having the Mrs standing behind me certainly helped!! Although she was offering only the sweet guidance a loved one can offer.<br /><br />Anyway...I did all the things the Samsung rep mentioned and now things are working great. Things are as good as new. Don't know why things went awry to begin with, but it could have been some bad paper, or poorly positioned paper. Things I can control on my end. So maybe it's me who should be getting the 1 star!!<br /><br />So...based on the initial price, the good service and the current good operation, I gotta give this a 5. I'm not sure if I have other Samsung stuff (nothing I can think of), but they're leaving me with a good impression.;;5.0;;March 1, 2012;;7;;8;;0.875

I chose this All-In-One for its duplexing abilities and native AirPrint support, which Canon didn't offer on any of it's printers.<br /><br />I have a mixed MAC OS X Lion and Windows 7 household.<br /><br />Printer setup was easy, even over wireless.<br /><br />It is apparent that most of the software design was geared for Windows, which is understandable given its advertised for workgroups and most of the computers in the world run Windows.<br /><br />The printer and scanner work well, but the Windows software is much better integrated with the OS. I have not tested the fax as I rarely have the need for that function.<br /><br />Now the reason I rated this printer with only two stars (I would have rated it with four stars otherwise): Epson support!<br /><br />Epson includes a third-party product called ABBYY which is what they use to OCR scans. The version supplied, 8.0, will not run under OS X Lion.<br /><br />They have a FAQ specifically for this issue on their support web site: [...]<br /><br />This method was tested on two separate Macs running OS X Lion and didn't work in either case.<br /><br />Contacting Epson via their email support generated a response email that it was obvious that they didn't actually read the email.<br />Subsequently contacting them via phone support was an even more frustrating experience as I was transferred to one person after another, and still no one was able to to anything; just eventually read from a prepared script.<br /><br />I usually don't need support, but when I do it needs to be helpful.<br /><br />I shall be a bit more patient the next time I upgrade, and Canon will be my choice as Epson has some of the worst support that I have ever expierenced.<br /><br />The bottom line, you cannot OCR under OS X Lion with the software supplied from Epson!;;2.0;;November 4, 2011;;9;;11;;0.818182

My experience with this one has been good and generally consistent with the majority of other reviews here.  Based on what I read, I was prepared for a noisy device, but I have been pleasantly surprised.  The printer is indeed noisy when initially powered on, but that lasts about 10 seconds, after which the noise level decreases to a low whirr for another 20-30 seconds, followed by complete silence until it is used.  The noise level naturally increases when it is actively printing, but the level seems no worse that that of any other home printers I've used that print at the same speed.  Some reviewers report having to turn on Quiet Mode, which reduces printing speed.  I didn't find that necessary; the default behavior (Quiet Mode off) was fine.  Of course, some people are more sensitive to noise than others, and the environment in which the printer is being used is a factor, too.<br /><br />The physical setup and installation instructions are comprehensive and flawless.  I especially like the animations showing how to remove hidden pieces of packing material, which I might not otherwise have gotten right.  The configuration process is also very clear (I'm using the network interface, not USB) and worked without a hitch.  Well done, HP.<br /><br />If you plan to use this printer for straight-through printing, be aware that the paper comes straight out of the back, meaning that you must leave sufficient space behind it.  To activate th straight-through paper path you simply open a door at the rear within a larger panel that also opens (for clearing jams).  It's important to get this right, and while the documentation is explicit, the warning is easy to overlook, and it's easy to make a mistake in practice.  Finally, there is no bin to catch the paper coming out the back, so you have to make other provisions.  Of course, none of this is relevant for the normal printing path, which deposits the paper in the main output bin on top.<br /><br />Overall, a very satisfactory printer for my home office.;;4.0;;October 10, 2009;;21;;21;;1.0

First thing i noticed was how slow the printing was, and would take 1 minute to actually print after sending the commands.  Then it would stop printing all together and both cpu's would report the printer as offline.<br /><br />Tried every fix under the sun based from others reports and HP support and it was never fixed, so decided i must have a bad unit.  ...so returned for a replacement.  Got the new model, and same exact issues.  Have the desktop now hardwired to the printer via USB, and it seems to be working most of the time, although still very slow.  Also the scan to computer functions almost never works and you always have to re-activate the function from within the clunky hp software within the cpu.  Finally, the Air Print technology for mobile devices does not work well either.<br /><br />And before anyone assumes all of this is user error, I'm an IT professional with an MCSE.  I love HP products and have never seen issues like this before.  Is it possible i got two bad models?  ..maybe, but i am going to start looking at Brother in the future I think.;;1.0;;April 26, 2011;;6;;7;;0.857143

But as of yet, I am unimpressed.<br /><br />Easy setup. Unpacking, untaping, loading print head and ink, calibration, software installation took just under an hour. The included CD prompted to automatically go online to get the latest driver and firmware - a nice touch.<br /><br />The printer looks great, nice fit and finish and easy to navigate, bright touch screen menu. Loading the ink and paper was intuitive and easy, much like my previous Canon Optima printer.<br /><br />The output is worse than expected for a Kodak mid-line photo printer. The colors are not even close to what's on my screen. Admittedly, this is not unusual. But skin tones are uneven, with hilights blown to white and there is no saturation of color. In fact, I used photoshop to increase saturation (+25!) and the photo output hardly changed. There seems to be a greenish cast to photos. The one black and white photo I printed is sharp but darker than what appears on my screen and lacking some detail in the dark areas.<br /><br />I think this printer would be a good solution for my children's homework papers where color fidelity is not so important and (presumably) the ink cost is lower than other printers. As an amateur photographer, there is no way I can continue to use this for prints I wish to frame or show off to others.<br /><br />More info and updates to this review as I get more experience with the printer.;;2.0;;June 4, 2012;;15;;16;;0.9375

Automatic duplex feature is very nice and saves paper.<br />I have had not problems with the ADF or the paper tray, i.e. no jamming whatsoever.<br /><br />Scanner :<br /><br />once you learn how to use Lexmark's "scan center" software, it is a straight forward operation saving scanned images to MS Word documents. The instruction manual is not very explicit about this and could be greatly improved<br /><br />FAX :<br /><br />getting the Lexmark X264dn to SEND FAXes is reasonably straight forward. However,<br />getting it to RECEIVE FAXes requires some work. For starters, the instruction manual is WOEFULLY INADEQUATE describing the FAX features; it contains no explanation whatsoever about receiving FAXes.<br />After I searched around on Lexmark's customer support web site I found several technical bulletins that explain the settings for receiving FAXes that have to be configured correctly (I use a single phone line with a separate answering machine which is the most tricky set-up). After some trial and error I was finally able to get the FAX modem to recognize FAXes AFTER the answering machine<br />has answered an incoming phone call.<br />If you want to receive FAXes, be sure to read these technical bulletins first; it will save you much time and frustration.<br /><br />Bottom line : a decent MFP with a very attractive price, instruction manual is<br />inadequate for receiving FAX operation;;4.0;;April 2, 2010;;4;;5;;0.8

The wireless capability is pretty helpful; I can print documents from my laptop and desktop remotely pretty well.<br /><br />CONS: It doesn't scan documents/files to PDF files (my big disappointment...my old Cannon scanner did)...it only scans documents to JPEG and OCR formats. I have also discovered that the ORC format doesn't work, which is supposed to scan documents to text (TXT) format (I have to figure out how the OCR format works). Scan capability of this machine is pretty limited. I also tried to print photos using different papers (e.g. Cannon, HP) and the machine didn't print the photos but rather gave me an error message that I have put wrong papers. This is specially true when I tried to print 4x6 photos. It does accept other photo papers when printing letter sized photos.

I know it sounds so terrible... however if you place a stack of paper there, it consistently takes multiple sheets, and almost always leaves the last sheet there.<br />If this is a scan, then you have to start at the beginning and in order to avoid frustration as it will continue to take multiple sheets, you just wind up placing each document individually into the flatbed.<br />If this is a Copy then you have to go through your document and see what pages didn't copy and redo them and then reorder your copied document.<br />If this is a Fax then you are going to have to call the person you faxed and see what pages they missed and resend those.<br /><br />If you try to Scan/Copy/Fax something that is not a perfectly flat, pristine document (ie a mail piece) you better iron it first, any kind of bend or fold and the auto-document feeder will not recognize that it exists...<br /><br />Unless you want to waste all your time opening and closing the document lid scanning/copying/faxing pages one by one, this printer is not for you.<br /><br />If you can care less about the scanning/copying/faxing function and want a printer that is slower with poorer quality than its competitors and has terrible support... This is it!<br /><br />I have spent countless hours being jacked around by their tech support, i cannot return it to the store purchased from as the serial number doesn't match the one on my receipt thanks to their swap.

I like it a lot.  HP has made big improvements in its wireless printers over the years.  After using it for about four months, here are my impressions:<br /><br />PRO:<br />- Very high quality printing<br />- Very fast printing<br />- Built-in duplexer is great for saving paper<br />- Web interface is vastly improved over my old HP wifi printer<br />- Works seamlessly and flawlessly with Snow Leopard for printing, scanning, and faxing.<br />- Printing from iPhones and iPads works perfectly.<br /><br />CON:<br />- This thing drinks ink like mad.  The box makes all kinds of claims about ink savings, but they're complete bunk.  The regular color ink tanks are rated for 300 pages on the box.  No way.  According to the printer's own counter, I only got 99 pages before all three color tanks ran dry.  And I only printed a handful of 4x6 photos, so I'm not a heavy color user.<br />- Does not work with Leopard.  A lot of people dual-boot into Leopard to use legacy software (in my case, accounting software).  This printer will not work with Leopard.  So when I need to print checks, I just use the print dialog to generate a PDF file.  Then when I boot back into Snow Leopard, I drag the PDF onto the desktop printer icon, and it prints perfectly.<br />- The regular black ink tank is rated for 420 pages.  Not even close.  According to the printer's own counter, I got 175 pages before it ran out.  Almost all of my printing is black-and-white text, maybe covering 40% of a page, with the ink quantity set to below the default.  According to the printer's own counter, I got 175 pages, and that includes the color photo pages, too.<br />- Unlike my old HP wifi printer, this one will not scan documents directly to a folder on a Mac.  But you can scan to your web browser on a Mac.<br />- I can't overstate how quickly this printer sucks through ink.<br />- After one month, the duplexer broke.  One of the pieces came loose and was rattling around inside causing paper jams.  I was able to shake it out and snap it back where it belongs.  No problems since.<br />- Did I mention that this printer is an ink hog, and you'll never get anywhere near the claimed number of output pages?<br />- Once it starts printing a page, it prints very fast.  But it spends a long time klinking and clanking before it actually starts printing.  Most of the time the actual print time is three or four seconds, but the warm-up calisthenics are 20 seconds, so printing takes longer than claimed, since the box doesn't count the time it takes the printer to get ready to actually print.<br />- When you buy replacement ink, be sure to get the high capacity tanks to save yourself a couple of trips to the store. Otherwise, you'll be there all the time.<br />- The wifi in the printer is 802.11N, but only on the 2.4GHz band.  It doesn't do 5GHz.  I had to buy a dual-band router to get this thing on my network.<br />- When you buy replacement ink, try to do it at a store that gives you points or bucks or some other gimmick, because you'll be buying a lot of ink.  Oh, but not at Staples.  Staples advertises that it will give you bucks back for buying ink, but if you read the fine print, it doesn't apply to HP ink.  For some reason HP is the only brand of ink singled out for this treatment.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />After exactly 998 pages, this printer died.  The paper handling mechanism is munged and it can no longer pull paper in.  The paper just sits there.  At first I thought about replacing this printer with the exact same model so I could make use of the very expensive ink still in the tanks.  Then I realized that it's time to get off the HP train and try something new.<br /><br />My experience over the last 998 pages has been that this thing GUZZLES ink.

My use is at home for personal as well as some business printing.<br /><br />The set up was easy and the instructions clear.  Printing in B&W single sided is fast and of high quality.  I find the color printing to be a bit muted and not photo-like, but still acceptable.  The biggest negative is the duplex printing.  It works, but...  When I select two-sided printing, it takes forever to print.  It is so slow that I have given up using it completely.  As I was hurrying out of the house on a road trip, I tried to print a Google map in duplex, and it took so long I simply left the house without the map.  I don't know what is going on inside, but this is so bad I'm shocked it ever was released.<br /><br />Once I ignore duplex printing, and treat it like a nice feature I will rarely if ever use, then I am generally satisfied with the printer and recommend it for the price.;;3.0;;July 14, 2009;;20;;21;;0.952381

It will not do anything (scanning included, or black and white printing when color cartridges go) unless you keep all the ink cartridges filled and there are 4 of them.  Each one costs $15 and they always seem to be running out.  I got so frustrated that I took apart one of the ink cartridges and ink literally poured out of an "empty" cartridge.  The only reason why I bought this printer was because it was free with rebate when I bought my mac.  Zero dollars was too much to pay for this thing.  I wouldn't expect any better from a printer company like Epson but I do expect more from Apple.  Apple should not participate in such a racket.  Consumers and supporting companies like Apple should be aware of how much of a scam this printer this is and hopefully Epson will rework its business plan.  I plan on going back to my old HP, it will print until the ink runs out and will scan even if the ink is gone.

So far, it has proven to be a reliable workhorse.  While the Canon would require a reset (power cycle) on every 3rd or 4th print job, this HP has never yet needed a reset.  The same types of print jobs were being handled by each printer - MS Office docs, PDF files, and Web pages, for the most part, along with occasional check from QuickBooks.  The Canon would have a problem anytime the print area of a doc exceeded the printer's capabilities (e.g., less than 1/2 inch margins).  The HP takes those kinds of challenges in stride.  No one makes better Windows print drivers than HP.  Since the Canon was connected to our wireless network through a print server, troubleshooting was always complicated.  With the HP connected directly to the wired network, not only does it start printing faster, but it has yet to lose a print job.  As the lead tech support specialist for my house, I truly appreciate how resilient this printer is in dealing with whatever is sent to it, as well as how reliably it prints.  It has made my life quite a bit simpler.  My wife has come to me and said, "Have I told you how much I love this printer?"  Setup was a breeze and was completed in 10 minutes on multiple computers. I've found (and ordered on Amazon) replacement knock-off cartridges for about $25, so consumable costs are low. As has been noted in other reviews, the printer is loud when operating (especially the first page - which prints incredibly fast), but goes back to sleep in 30 seconds or so.  I've solved the noise problem by locating the printer in a credenza with doors.  The sleep feature is great, since it feels like it uses less power than the Canon. If you are looking for a super-compatible, networked laser printer, you can't go wrong with the P2035N.;;4.0;;May 3, 2010;;6;;6;;1.0

Since i have a mix of MacBooks, PCs, iPhones and iPads at the office, I was a bit worried about this.  No need, when I set up the machine and turned it on, I simply plugged it into my server, and off it went, for all of my "computers."  I can now print from iPads, iPhones, MacBooks, and PCs.

Truth be told, I was ticked off and not expecting to like the Envy, and thought I'd probably just go back to one of my many previous printers and hook up the old scanner as well.  I've used many ink-jet printers and a laser or two over the years, most of which have worked well, but buy new ones as "must-have" features become available.  This is the first time I have had a printer that made me say "This is SO cool!"<br /><br />It is so sleek and compact, with an auto-retracting paper catching tray and a touch control menu screen.  The setup went exactly as it was supposed to: wireless addition to my home network, scanning directly to my laptop, and HP's eprint, which allows you to send a print job from anywhere (android, ipad, other computers, etc) to this printer by way of its own email address - how cool is that?  I never expected to be so wowed by a printer.  It's great.<br /><br />NOTE:  Although it's called an all-in-one, it actually does not fax, partially allowing for the downsizing.

Initially, based on user reviews, I debated between the 430 and the Epson Artisan 730. But cost differences and the larger size of the 730 swayed me toward the 430, and I'm glad they did.  Overall, I've found it to exceed my expectations.  I did have an installation problem with the scanner software that appears to have to do more with my Windows than with the printer software (I detail this pretty common problem and my solution below).  Value-for-buck, I doubt there's much competition.<br /><br />In its category, this is one of the smallest all-in-ones I was able to find.  It has an efficient and fairly sleek design, with extendable paper trays and a tilting screen.<br /><br />The wireless printing and scanning is pretty fast as long as your wireless connection is pretty fast and unburdened. It responds immediately upon hitting the 'send'/'print'/'scan' buttons. If you download shows like I do, it will be slower during those times.<br /><br />Printing quality is reasonable.  When new, the 430 comes with a set of mid-range ink (124). You can purchase higher end Epson ink for better printing quality, but for ordinary documents the mid-range ink does the job.  From what I've seen, the ink costs are not unusual and even slightly lower than my former HP all-in-one.  That said, I've yet to see how long these fairly small Epson ink cartridges can last.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this printer is the simple interface and the wireless applications.  I can send print items from anywhere in my house, from my email if I'm away, or from my cell (there's an app).<br /><br />Two things I wish the printer could do but can't are automatic double-sided printing and auto-feed of pages to the scanner. Double-sided printing requires that you rotate the pages manually after the first side has been printed.  When scanning multiple pages, you need to be nearby and replace the pages, one by one.  That essentially nullifies the benefit of wireless scanning.  At the same time, for what I paid for this printer ($60), I can't really complain either.<br /><br />Finally, as I already mentioned, some users including yours truly have experienced some software installation problems with the scanner.  Like other reviewers, I've found Epson's customer support very underwhelming. But the fix to this problem was fairly simple once I figured it out.  First, I went to the product page and downloaded the designated scanner software (as opposed to the entire software package).  The installation worked this time, but the software still wouldn't work, claiming all kinds of strange things (including that the software was incompatible with my Windows Vista 64).  Then it occurred to me to check out the Epson scanner settings (as opposed to the Epson scan application), which appeared in my start menu.  There I was able to identify my scanner, and that seemed to do the trick.;;4.0;;November 29, 2011;;15;;16;;0.9375

Every Epson had the head clogging problem and cleaning the heads to get a perfect print was time consuming and ink wasting. You can let this Canon sit for weeks, fire it up and print a perfect image every time.<br /><br />I wrote a book and wasn't sure how it would sell so I started printing the front and rear convers on this printer. I printed the book pages on a duplexing, high speed HP LaserJet. The book has sold well and I continue to print the front and rear covers on thick photographic paper. I do this 100's at a time and there is never a burp. Every page is perfect and the print speed is very good.<br /><br />I use various brands of photographic paper. In fact, I have never used Canon papers. I have my monitor calibrated but not the printer.

No more 10 foot wires or dragging your laptop up a flight of stairs to print!<br />-Very good print quality on photos and jpegs. If you let it dry for about 2 minutes, no smearing or bleeding either. It's pretty dang fast too, taking about 1 minute to print out an 8.5" x 11" image.<br />-Very compact and lightweight for an all-in-one printer! Factor in the soothing blue activity light and shiny piano finish, and it makes a handsome addition to any home office corner!<br />-Cheaper than anything in this class at Staples or Best Buy, but with canon quality...that's a winning combo!<br /><br />CONS:<br />- It has the WiFi! Well, a little bit slow, but it still has it...I've connected the printer wirelessly to 3 computers: a macbook pro laptop running leopard, a brand new intel iMac running snow leopard, and an older Dell Optiplex running Windows XP. The printer runs well with all 3, except you have to sometimes hit the "Go" button on the printer before you print so the printer doesn't stay in sleep mode. Annoying, but it still works!<br />- Canon EX software. Not sure why this software sucks so bad, but it does! Besides being way less intuitive than other pre-packaged software, it also is the ONLY way to get your wireless stuff to scan. Which is odd, since you can copy something by pressing the easy to find "copy" button on top of the printer itself. The "print" and "scan" functions don't do diddly squat if you press them on the printer, you HAVE to use the unfriendly and densely laid out canon software. You may also print from the application itself (MS Word or text edit), but scanning is a single method as far as I can see.<br />-Ink doesn't last that long! Although it's not terrible (ahem*HP*ahem) in it's longevity, we've already started to run out of black ink after only 2 months of moderate printing (maybe 100 pages, tops).Refills haven't been ordered yet, so I can't say if the newer cartridges will last longer.<br /><br />So I was going to give it only 3 stars after reading my own comments, but for some reason I really like this printer and can't seem to give it less than 4 stars, especially comparing it to the other crappy HP and Epson printers I've had in the past.;;4.0;;April 18, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

I looked at Epson, an excellent workhorse and I have one that prints CD's; at Canon which looks nifty but didn't have the envelope printing capability, and ultimately went again with HP.  This one uses fewer ink cartridges even for slick multicolored photographs on glossy paper.  HP has dropped the Photo-black on this model. The nifty touchscreen is shaped like an iPhone, which I find curious and even has a slide show on how to do setup and load the paper tray which (HOORAY!) slides out for easier loading.  The only difference I encountered was in initiating a scan ... toss the old HP Scan Pro and click directly on the new HP Scan 3 from your desktop or laptop.  It brings up a more user-friendly window to work your scan with.  Also; I've used heavier paper (28# for laser print) for more durable copies when I need a color photo and don't want to waste a glossy page.  The documentation says it will take cover stock as well.

The Canon photos were pretty bad, compared to my Epson R280.  The HP was somewhat better, but lacked the snap of my Epson R280.  The Epson NX420 produces very acceptable photo prints, almost the equal of the Epson R280. The Epson R280 is designed as a photo printer and uses the 5-color plus black, dye-based Claria ink.  The Epson NX420 is designed for general-purpose use and uses pigment-based, DURABrite inks, 3 colors plus black, in separate cartridges, unlike the Canon and HP which have all three colors in the same cartridge.<br /><br />I wanted to consolidate the scanner and printer to save desktop space and reduce the wires.  All are Wi-fi wireless printers, but I never got the HP to work wirelessly.  The Canon was somewhat difficult, while the Epson was a breeze.  The Canon only cost $49 and the HP $69 from WalMart.  I ordered the Epson NX420 from Amazon for $49.95, postage and tax free. Amazingly, I ordered on Wednesday and received it on Friday, two days, total.

It's a good looking AIO, reasonably quiet and convenient.

I selected this particular model because it was on sale at for half price at Staples but I also checked reviews carefully before purchasing and was satisfied that it has been rated very positively by other users.<br /><br />Prior to this purchase I have been using an HP b&w laserjet printer P1006 that is now four or five years old but continues to perform excellently, and a Canon injet printer (MP610) which has also worked fine and is under two years old. This Epson printer will eventually probably replace both as I use up the toner and ink supplies that I have on hand for those older printers, because the ink cost and efficiency of this printer are claimed to be much better than what I've been using.<br /><br />My usage is not heavy, I am using this for home needs and it is probably very light compared to some users.<br /><br />My home network consists of an iMac with Apple AirPort wi-fi. My existing printers were networked by plugging them directly into the AirPort device since they do not have wi-fi built in. Those printers have always given me intermittant problems in that they did not always respond immediately to print jobs sent to them. Whether that is due to printer software issues or something else, I don't really know. I've always kept the software drivers up-to-date.<br /><br />Setting up this new Epson printer was straightforward and easy. In fact it could not have been easier. Once the printer was powered up and ink installed, and the software installed on my computer, I used the setup screen on the printer for it to find the home network and log in. Once linked to my network, the computer recognized it and I added it to my list of printers. Just a very short time after unpacking it from the box, it is a part of my home network and printing seamlessly from all applications. I also ran Apple's software update program right after completing the installation and verifying operation of the printer, and it updated the printer driver so that it is completely up-to-date since I knew that the driver included with the CD may not have been the latest version (but it did not result in any problems with installation).<br /><br />I would therefore rate the wi-fi compatibility of this printer to be outstanding based upon the ease of connecting to my home network and the immediate availability for printing from the computer.<br /><br />Print quality is excellent for everything I have tried so far. I like the fact that this printer has a paper tray to hold the paper supply, rather than setting the paper vertically in a feeder (like my Canon printer uses), and the printer tray capacity is large at 250 sheets. The paper tray is also adjustable for various sizes including envelopes (for those who still send things through the US mail). The tray is somewhat flimsy as other reviewers have noted. It also has the capability for two-sided printing (as well as scanning and faxing), another feature I did not have previously. This printer uses separate cartridges for each ink color (I expect this is pretty standard these days for color inkjet printers).<br /><br />This printer has also given me two important features I did not previously have - scanning and faxing.<br /><br />For my first test of the scanning capability I scanned a CD booklet cover that I needed for my iTunes library (some older CD's, when loaded into the iTunes, do not find CD artwork in the database used. I've put most of my CD collection onto iTunes and have been frustrated in the past when I was not able to get the right artwork to go with the music in my iTunes library. Now I can scan in the artwork for those CD's which are not in the general database - finally!).<br /><br />The iMac comes with Image Capture software. All I had to do was open the Image Capture program, and it recognized the Epson scanner immediately. I put the CD booklet on the flatbed scanner and initiated the scan from the computer. It works perfectly. Lots of settings to play with; to vary resolution, rotate the image and so forth, which I think are probably more a function of the scanner software than they are of the scanner itself. I've also tried scanning objects that require the lid to be left open, with very good results. I am completely satisfied with the scanning capability, lots of things I can now do that I was unable to do before having this printer. (I should mention that the Canon MP610 also has scanning capability but I was never able to get it to work for me. Probably my fault for not putting enough effort into it, but again it illustrates for me at least how easy the setup was for this Epson unit).<br /><br />I've since used the scanning frequently, and it works very well. I am very satisfied with this feature<br /><br />Faxing is likewise troublefree. The initial setup is done at the computer where you program in the heading that you want printed to each sheet faxed, set the number of rings before picking up, and so forth. Also can program quick dial numbers so that they are available from the keypad on the fax machine itself. Very nice to be able to do these setup tasks on the computer rather than having to do it on the printer itself. My first fax transmission consisted of a 16 page document, and it fed through and faxed without trouble. Fax receipts have likewise been fully satisfactory.<br /><br />Finally, this Epson printer also includes "print-to-fax" software, so that I can now send a fax directly from the computer without needing to print the document first and then run it through the fax machine. The way this is implemented is that the available printer listing on the computer now includes this printer twice - the first time for printing normally, and the second listing for fax use (both are clearly labeled and differentiated). Select which one you want depending on what you want to do, and use the drop-down menus to either provide the fax number to send to, or use one of the quick dial numbers. Superb!<br /><br />I have not yet tried the AirPrint capability but that is one more thing this printer offers that may be of interest to others.<br /><br />For me, most of these features were a welcome upgrade from my previous setup, and I'm delighted with having this on my network at home. This is my first Epson product, and I'm looking forward to receiving good service from it. I will update this review over time as I gain experience with it and have more basis for reporting on reliability and any other issues or features I have not yet come across.;;5.0;;March 2, 2012;;11;;11;;1.0

The bottom line is that Epson has a winner, I made the right selection for me, and I highly recommend this product!  The printer itself is beautiful, sleek, and not too large for my cabinet-top. The printing, copying, touch panel, optics, firmware, flawless setup process and level of automation were extremely well engineered. I was able to eliminate three other disjointed components plus a separate wireless print-server and all associated cables, power cords, etc with this multiple function component. We never needed a USB cable for anything-wireless worked perfectly, even for a firmware update.<br /><br />I'd been researching multiple function printers for a few months and had settled on either the newly announced Canon PIXMA MG8220 or the newly announced Epson Artisan 837.  Both have excellent features, specs, reviews and capabilities.  I wanted to replace my standalone Epson scanner, standalone Brother black and white laser printer/fax/copier and my standalone HP D5360 color text/photo/direct to CD & DVD printer, all with a single multifunction printer.  They both would enable me to do this, but what pushed me off the fence was the auto-document feeder, which the Canon doesn't have.<br /><br />Make sure you remove the blue tape used to secure the 837 during shipping.  There's even some tape you can't see, such as in the paper tray.  By the way, some reviewers criticize the paper trays on both the predecessor Epson Artisan 835 and Canon printers.  Indeed, the plastic is thin, but no more flimsy than many of my other printers and I have no qualms that it'll break unless I physically twist it.<br /><br />Setup was amazingly simple, fast and automated, using the printer's touch panel.  It walked me through the process when I powered up, including connecting to my wireless network.  I don't broadcast my SSID so it let me input my Network name, then it proceeded to verify connectivity as "excellent"!  It prompted me to install the ink cartridges and after about seven minutes had primed them and was ready to print.<br /><br />Next, I installed the most current drivers for my OSX Lion Macbook from Epson's support website.  The first note on the installation guide says to not use the included CD if running Lion. I never had to connect my Macbook to the printer with a USB cable at all.  Once Lion drivers were installed, I let it find my Artisan 837, I configured my options for printing (duplex) and provided my header info and configured my Macbook for faxing.  Last, I printed a test page to confirm everything was completed--all was perfect.  Then I inserted the CD and installed the Print CD app, User's Guide, and ABBYY FineReader (everything except the drivers).<br /><br />I installed the drivers and fax setup on my wife's Windows 7 notebook using the CD.  The Epson app scanned and found the Artisan 837 immediately, made the wireless connection, and proceeded to ask me if I wanted to automatically update the firmware (I did).<br /><br />I've printed photos, text and graphics so far and the results are truly spectacular, as are print-outs from the copy function.  The scans were fast and very sharp.  I haven't printed directly to a CD or DVD yet, nor have I used the fax (other than to test that the fax configuration is correct) but I'm confident both will be perfect as well, based on other reviews.  If not, I'll post an update.<br /><br />** Updated review title to include great support for OSX 10.8 also.;;5.0;;September 10, 2011;;135;;139;;0.971223

The quality is truly LAB QUALITY!!! Setting it up was so easy (I turned it on and followed a few prompts on my laptop and on the printer and within 10 minutes I was wirelessly printing photos and documents from my living room!  It was so easy, in fact, that I even got a little crazy and decided to use some of the other functions. Double sided printing is amazing...you don't do anything except click "double sided printing" on your computer!  The printer prints a page, sucks it back into the printer, then prints the back of the page.  I can also take a picture with my smartphone (doesn't have to be an iphone) and send that phone picture to my printer to print the photo when I'm not even home! WITHOUT a computer I can print today's weather (and customize it so that it's local to me)today's USA Today news, Epicurious recipes, stuff for the kids to color and a bunch of other things.<br />+ The scanning resolution is amazing!<br />+ The touch screen is large, easy to see and use<br />+ There's a little door for my memory card from my camera<br />+ While providing lab quality photos, it's amazingly economical on ink!<br />+ When printing photos and documents it's super fast!<br />As a side note, the sleek design is a nice change from the crappy dated designs out there.

Upon receiving this printer I ran into only one problem in setup--it doesn't support wireless N networks. This means I would have to slow my entire network down to Wireless G speeds in order to use the wireless functionality. Additionally, there is no ethernet networking capability so I couldn't connect it to my wireless router via ethernet. I was able to print wirelessly by plugging the USB cable into a USB port on my router so my router works as a print server.<br /><br />Not a huge deal, but I would have preferred to not pay for wireless capability since my setup couldn't utilize it. Again, if I had done a little research, I am guessing I would have been aware of this before purchasing. I hope this saves somebody from buying a printer that won't work on their wireless network.;;3.0;;April 14, 2010;;11;;13;;0.846154

We were using a Brother laser printer for most of our printing - and then switching to an Epson inkjet whenever we needed color.<br /><br />Aside from having 2 printers, the main problems we were having were: the Brother printers in general tend to ruin envelopes and the Epson inkjets cost a fortune to run.<br /><br />The main requirements we had for this printer included:<br /><br />- Needed to be accessible through the network.  Wireless doesn't matter at all - it just needs to be on the network.<br />- Good color capability<br />- Duplex printing - most of the documents we print are required by law to be duplex, and it's cheaper anyway since it saves paper<br />- Good envelope handling - As I already mentioned, I love Brother laser printers in general; but, they really do wrinkle up envelopes pretty badly<br />- Color printing needed to be less expensive than an inkjet - I know it's still more expensive to print color, but the inkjets are horrible!<br /><br />Fortunately, this HP has delivered in every category.  It is just a bit slower than the Brother HL-5370DW that we were using, but it is keeping up with our workload just fine.<br /><br />I've always hated the huge software packages that HP bundles with their printers, but it was easy to just download the driver off their website and install it directly.  The driver installer didn't have any issues locating the printer on the network either.<br /><br />As far as print quality goes, it is absolutely amazing!  The black is what we've come to expect from any modern laser, but the color just blew me out of the water!  Honestly, I've always thought you couldn't get photo-quality pictures from a laser printer, but this definitely comes close.  It excels at printing any kind of business graphic we would ever need - and does it quickly, and with full duplex.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend the M451dn.  We've been very pleased with this one over the last month, and I'm having trouble thinking of anything we don't like about it. :);;5.0;;March 21, 2012;;35;;37;;0.945946

It's a shame as the 5320 otherwise seems pretty well designed. The paper drawer/tray is the actual bottom of the printer, making it more difficult to open, & they went to their older style, extending rear paper feed/support, but those are minor negatives I could live with if it didn't print red as orange. Also darker prints tended to have a blue or purplish tint [that can be compensated for in software], while all images/graphics printed to non-photo paper showed an awful lot of grain. We're more than happy to live with that level of print quality with our 1/2 dozen other Canon printers, but those are bottom dollar remans [~$25] used for everyday tasks where that sort of thing doesn't matter, & in fact on plain paper the output from 1 of our MX320s actually looked better than what we got from the MG 5320!<br /><br />One thing I immediately disliked was Canon put LEDs on their print cartridges to tell you the cartridge installed properly [they also can tell you when the ink is low or out, but I can't imagine opening the printer to check ink levels when with a mouse click you can see the same thing]. We pay enough for ink cartridges already without upping the costs by adding LEDs you don't need [perhaps an attempt to distinguish Canon ink from 3rd party replacements?].<br /><br />The included software is for the most part useless & unchanged from 3-4 year old versions. Their photo print app can't use ICC profiles or Windows color management in win7, makes it a lot of extra work to import an image to print on a CD/DVD, and makes you set the diameter of the CD/DVD printable area in inches rather than mm [& only goes to 2 decimal points, making it impossible to avoid non-printed, outer white rings]. There's very little in the way of printer ICC profiles &/or driver-based color adjustments.<br /><br />All in all I really wanted to like the MG5320, but in the end I simply couldn't justify keeping it -- I couldn't find any Positives to offset the Negatives. Cranking the driver's color adjustment over towards red helped a little, but not enough. The lack of red also meant some faces were completely washed out, looking like ghosts with no other features besides the eyes & mouth. Software was only a minor, negative issue, though the drivers left a lot of leftovers when uninstalled -- I've got other software I could have probably used to print CDs/DVDs/BDs, though the driver settings to use weren't immediately clear, & I have no idea how many discs I'd have to go through adjusting the print position. Time to print [before printing really started], especially with DVDs was very long. Ink usage seemed poor, & replacement cartridges aren't cheap compared to other brands. Using the same ink cartridges, & apparently the same software & driver controls, I'm not optimistic the higher end Canon models do better -- I'm skipping the brand for now.;;1.0;;January 3, 2012;;29;;36;;0.805556

[...] Due to budgetary constrictions, translation my sweet wife, I have been making a gradual move towards perfect color for the past 3-4 years. Perfection being unattainable of course, things you MUST have to get close to perfection include:<br /><br />1) A good camera, tons of good stuff on the market from Nikon and Canon. I use a Nikon D300. Shoot RAW files btw, take my word for it, Google it, end of the day its like having a time machine for things like white balance, exposure compensation, saturation levels, black levels, fill light, recovery, vibrance and on and on and on. With lossy jpg files...good luck. You can always export jpgs from your RAW files, so shoot RAW.<br /><br />2) A good monitor (doesn't have to be a $2,500 - $5,000 Eizo save your money for things that will get you closer to perfection with more bang for your buck). I'm using a 27" HD Viewsonic VX2739wm that is calibrated which leads me to #3.<br /><br />3) A way to calibrate your monitor and printer (with Epson pro papers, the ICC profiles they provide via download work exceptionally well, but you still MUST calibrate your monitor) take my word for it; get the Color Munki Photo (under $500 now) and it works amazingly well. Better than devices costing 5 - 7 times more just a few short years ago.<br /><br />4) Good photo editing software; I use Lightroom 3.3 and Photoshop CS5 but I have to tell you I spend 95% of my time in Lightroom so most bang for your buck is there. I use PS for retouching or being creative primarily, I never print from Photoshop. I always print from Lightroom, it has the best printing interface of anything on the market. If you are thinking yeah but I can't softproof in lightroom, that leads me to #5.<br /><br />5) Softproofing plugin for Lightroom: [...] This is a very important piece of the puzzle, if you don't learn how to softproof, you will never get close to perfect color and contrast in your prints. Visit the Luminous Landscape web site and download ($44) their "From Camera to Print" video series. They are updating it from the version I have that was shot in 2007, worth every penny. I learned more about color calibration and getting great prints watching this series than everything else I have seen and read combined.<br /><br />6) Professional paper, sorry you're not getting close with that off-the-shelf coated crap from Staples or Walmart and you need a good printer to handle professional papers which leads to #7.<br /><br />7) A good printer. The Epson R3000 fills the bill at a great price point. It uses the same print head, firmware and inks of printers costing thousands of dollars. If your print volume is low and 13" wide (panorama's up to 13 x 44) suits your need don't even think about the 3880. It doesn't handle roll paper (think canvas on hardboard or gallery wraps up to 11 x how long you want) or thicker fine art papers at all. The R3000 handles many more professional papers than the 3880 from Epson and from other manufacturers including Hahnem&uuml;hle with ICC profiles for the R3000. Forget the Epson 4900 with 200 ml ink cartridges if your volume is low. Those cartridges will run you a thousand bucks or more to replace and if you don't use them in a timely manner because you are terrified of the cost they could expire and do a wonderful job of clogging the print head. With a low volume you simply don't need it.<br /><br />I have nothing but praise for this printer. It is phenomenal. The roll feeder and WiFi are two great features. Check out RC Concepcion's (Photoshop User Magazine) review of this printer on YouTube.<br /><br />I have finally attained the contrast, color and black and white print quality I have been waiting for. Epson has bridged the gap for amateurs who want pro results with their prints with this printer.;;5.0;;December 16, 2011;;23;;24;;0.958333

The printer is top-notch (a little bit noisey, but not too bad) and the Zeen Tablet is great. It has great battery life and a great build-quality (with a glass screen and rubberized body). Don't listen to the comments of people that just don't know how to use an Android Tablet. Some reviews I've read suggest that this tablet can only be used indoors on the same network as the printer...NOT TRUE, this is a tablet that has all of the same functionality as any Android 2.1 Tablet (plus all of the ePrint functions that you won't find on any other device) with the exception of the official Google Marketplace. To me, this is not a big deal as there are so many other ways to install Android Apps (alternate Markets, side-loading or direct downloads from the web). Some people have also complained about the Tablet being slow or laggy. This is not uncommon for any Android Tablet (with the possible exception of the Tegra2 processor Tablets) as there are many things that can be running in the background. The simple fix is to install a Task-Killer app that will shut down unused programs that are still running in the background. I would also recommend the purchase of the external power adapter/charger so that you can travel with the Zeen Tablet and not have to worry about losing power. I have over 100 working apps on the Zeen and counting. It plays all my music, videos, downloads YouTube videos, opens and edits Office documents, email, multiple web-browsers, etc. Unless you need a device that has 3G, you won't need anything else in a tablet. The way I look at it, I paid less than $250 for a great Tablet and got a great FREE wifi-enabled printer. Oh, and one more thing, for those that have complained that they don't like the HP User-Interface as opposed to the standard Android UI, why not just install a Home-Screen replacement app like LauncherPro that way you can make your Zeen tablet look like every other Android device?<br /><br />UPDADE: 3/18/11:<br />HP just released their Beta Program for Android Froyo 2.2.

But it does have its drawbacks and its important for people to know about them prior to purchase.<br /><br />The unpacking and setup is a bit of a challenge if you are not tech-savvy. The instructions are in some ways almost too simple. If you can follow pictures you are probably okay. But if you ever ask 'why' questions or want to know what you're doing and why, you won't get anything like that and installation may be harder for you.<br /><br />The printer is 'smart', and not always in a good way. It takes a very long time - orders of minutes - to initialize. Many times I have had to turn the printer on because I forgot to do so in advance. And then had to wait several MINUTES while it initialized. This is not a one-time process. This is an everytime I turn the power on process. The printer is fond of cleaning its print heads often too, which may be unexpected if this is  your first 'smart' printer.  The HP  Deskjet 6122 I had previously (another double-sided and image printer) was quieter, smaller and much faster responding to print commands. The 6122 dual-sided paper handling was done entirely internally. The new OfficeJet Pro 8500A Plus uses a separate mechanical dual-sided paper handler that frankly is very kludgy. And it often bends paper. The paper eject is quite forceful; it often lands on the table in front of the printer and not atop the document tray which I think is the intended design.<br /><br />Installing the scanner software seems to be a bit problematic. It does not work directly out of the box; at least it did not for me. This might be a setup error, although I tried to follow the limited instructions correctly. There seems to be a missing software component which I finally located and installed manually. Honestly, if I weren't a software professional I don't think I would have ever figured this part out.<br /><br />I cannot comment on the fax capabilities. Again there is a bit to the setup and I am not currently configured for it. I would be suspicious however given the other minor surprises that have popped up.<br /><br />I have to admit that overall I am NOT IMPRESSED with the HP OfficeJet 8500A Plus. It looked like a good idea. I wanted an 'all-in-one' printer, scanner, copier with fax capabilities. This particular printer DOES NOT DELIVER is my opinion.  I would strongly suggest that anyone contemplating buying this printer (or any HP printer in the OfficeJet product line) demand to see every aspect of the printer demonstrated on a live system. Lacking that, I must RECOMMEND AGAINST BUYING THIS PRODUCT! Do so online with no prior evaluation AT YOUR OWN RISK!;;3.0;;March 3, 2011;;6;;7;;0.857143

The reason this printer is going to the recycler is the cost of operation due to HP's decision to gouge consumers on replacement ink cartidges.<br /><br />If you look up the unit price on replacement cartridges, it does not sound unreasonable: roughly thirty USD for the black cartridge and twenty USD each for the three color cartridges. However, what you need to be aware of is that the printer decides when the cartridges need to be replaced and WILL NOT FUNCTION until you comply.<br /><br />This is a change from a few years ago, when you would receive a low ink warning but could still print until the cartridge actually emptied. This disabling of all print functions may be becoming a standard industry practice but, in my experience, is particularly egregious with this HP printer.<br /><br />It is no coincidence that all four cartridges are flagged as needing replacement at roughly the same time.  Even if you have been printing only black and white draft copies in the interval since replacement, the color cartridges will be flagged as empty after a few months.<br /><br />As this happens, at the least, twice a year, you will be spending close to two hundred dollars a year to maintain even minimum function.<br /><br />After literally a mere few months, using the "high-capacity" XL cartridges and extremely rare use (I rarely print more than a dozen pages per month), this printer is once again disabled due to an entirely fictitious low-ink warning.  This function is clearly not triggered by actual use, the number of pages printed or the volume of ink remaining.  It is based entirely on an algortithm combining some arbitrary time since cartridge installation and HP's greed.<br /><br />Again: The resident software decides when you will replace the ink cartridges (of which there are four) and it will not print so much as a single page until you do.<br /><br />If you print enough pages in both black and white and color, and exhaust the cartridges in a short period of time, you may consider this printer a good value.<br /><br />Read many of the four and five star reviews carefully: "I've had this printer one month and I love it", "I've had it for one day...", etc.  I'm happy for them, but I have owned this printer for fifteen months and am replacing it.<br /><br />This will be my last HP printer.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have received (11/18/2010) notice of a settlement offer in response to three lawsuits filed against HP alleging fraudulent practices related to the issues noted above.  Quote: "HP denies all these claims" but will offer coupons redeemable at the HP online store (only) as compensation.  One can therefore assume they intend to continue these practices. HP is offering an insulting maximum six dollar credit for qualifying printers. For more information: hpinkjetprintersettlement dot com;;1.0;;October 22, 2010;;246;;250;;0.984

The cooling fan turns on as soon as you plug it in, and it will not turn off for 15 minutes (according to Brother tech support). They said this is necessary to cool the fuser. I haven't experienced this before with any other laser printer, and it's annoying as hell.<br /><br />I sent it back for this reason alone, it may very well be the best printer in the world if they hadn't designed it in such a way. If you don't mind listening to a buzz/hum of the fan for 15 minutes after you print a document, then this might be the printer for you.;;2.0;;November 3, 2011;;30;;35;;0.857143

I wanted an all-in-one that had wireless capability as my router is not near where I wanted to put the printer.  After researching several different printers, I chose the Cannon after reading the other reviews.  And I am glad I made that choice.<br /><br />Pros: Very good picture quality, ease of set up and the features.<br /><br />Cons: No paper level indicator on the outside of the printer.<br /><br />This was the easiest printer I have ever set up.  After unpacking and un-tapeing it, I plugged it in and went through the set-up procedure in the Quick Set-up Guide and in about 10 minutes the printer was working.  The wireless set-up was just as easy.  I went through the wireless set-up and chose WPS Push Button Mode, confirmed my choice and then pushed the WPS button on my wireless router and within a few seconds the Cannon found and connected to the router.  After that, I installed the Cannon software on my laptops and after each software install, the laptop found and installed the printer.  It took about 30 minutes to install the printer on all three of my laptops.<br /><br />The print quality is very good and pictures, while not as good as an inkjet, are good enough for everyday use by my family's work and school projects.  The printer allows you to fax from a computer and the copy quality is also very good.  As with other printers I researched, we have not had a problem with the paper rolling too much after a print.  There is some minor rolling to the paper but it flattens out after a minute or two.<br /><br />My one complaint, and it is a very minor complaint, is that there is no paper level indicator on the outside of the printer.  My old Okidata had a lever on the paper tray to tell you how much paper is left but Cannon did not include one on this printer.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with the printer so far.;;5.0;;January 18, 2012;;13;;13;;1.0

Even though the printer does not state it supports Linux, HP generally does provide open source drivers.  I did not have any issues setting up the printer or getting it on the network.  I could not use the utility on the included CD, since it is for Windows, but as able to accomplish it from the printers front panel.  I was able to print from all my machines wirelessly without much fuss.  My only problem is that I cannot scan wirelessly or via USB.  It might just be an issue of waiting for the next version of the HP drivers to come out.<br /><br />Note that there are SUB-VERSIONS of this printer. Mine says it is a OfficeJet 4500 g510n-z.  According to HP's web site [...] the g510-a, g510-b, g510-g and g510-h are fully supported in their latest version of the drivers.  So depending on the sub-version you get you results may vary.<br /><br />I have printed quite a bit with this printer and the only complaint I have is that sometimes it fails to go into power-saver mode.  It does not appear to have issues losing the network connection, it has sat idle for days then printed wirelessly on the first attempt.<br /><br />If you see this printer in a store and see on the box a statement that it can scan to any network drive, there is a caveat to this.  You can only scan TO a computer running Windows or Mac software from CD. Your computer can then save it to a network folder.  Even though the printer is network enabled, it cannot scan directly to a network share.  I was kinda bummed out about this.;;3.0;;July 16, 2010;;12;;14;;0.857143

This printer was easy to install if you have a little knowledge of printer installation using the disk provided.  I was able to toggle through the menus to achieve basic set up without reading any of the other documentation and it has worked very well for three months now.  The fax function is preset to store your document(s) before transmitting and that can be a little annoying if you are expecting to have your document scanned and sent immediately, but there is a fax confirmation page available through the menu that is actually a small copy of your document front page which is real nice and addresses any questions about if the document was sent or not.  There is also a summary transmittal page the can be printed daily as well.  We like this machine quite a bit although it is hard on toner, the print quality is very good for our needs as a basic office printer/fax/copier. At the time we purchased this unit HP was offering a special rebate at 50% off so we were able to get quite a deal.  We would buy it again, even at full price.;;5.0;;September 13, 2008;;5;;5;;1.0

I have not had any problems with it.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Connecting wirelessly is a nightmare, even for technical people like me.<br />- Connection drops frequently.<br />- Can't print when connected to VPN.<br />- Clearing print queue doesn't matter...all documents will still print even when queue is cleared.<br />- I'm not sure what it does before and after each print job, but it's loud and takes forever...and when you think it's done, nope! Extremely annoying!<br />- Tells me my ink supply is low when it's not....of course, you have to clear the warning before you you can print.<br />- God forbid anyone wants to use generic ink...errors pop up telling you this as if you didn't know. The errors have to be cleared before the print job will start.<br />- If you lose power or the printer gets unplugged by mistake, the printer will make sure it yells at you for not shutting down properly. Of course, error has to manually be cleared before the job will print.<br />- The printer kicks out a blank sheet before every new job.<br />- The paper feed stops at the end of the page and will not let it go, then after a few minutes finally spits it out.<br />- The paper just falls on the floor because the tray is not long enough...I mean, there is really not a tray to catch the paper.<br /><br />I'm sure there are plenty more issues that I couldn't think of.

I hooked up the USB (a USB cable, supplied in the box, is required for initial setup) and the printer was not recognized by the Mac.  So I power cycled and it was recognized.<br /><br />I ran the HP Firmware Upgrade Utility to flash the firmware so the printer will work with AirPrint devices like my iPad.  The printer did not show up as a valid device. on the iPad  Then I noticed that the blue wireless networking light on the printer was not on.  So wireless would not work.<br /><br />I tried following the instructions by By R. Ruiz to add wireless networking, but they failed at the step<br /><br />9. Click the HTML CONFIG button<br /><br />The web page would not display, so I could not proceed with the steps.  This means I would be stuck using this as a USB printer, not wireless.<br /><br />Fortunately, I had a Windows 7 laptop.  I plugged in a USB cable.  Automatic setup did not work as advertised, so I inserted the driver CD and installed from there.  I requested a wireless setup and did the steps manually just to be safe.  It confirmed my SSID, and it asked for my network password.  It then installed the driver and the blue light on the printer turned solid blue.  I unplugged USB and printed a test page.  It worked.<br /><br />Back to the Mac, I replaced its USB cable then went into Print & Scan preferences under Settings.  The USB printer was defined there.  But I wanted wireless.  So I followed R. Ruiz's instructions again, and got past step 9.  It turns out that wireless was already setup.  This was confirmed by going to<br /><br />1) Click Open Print Queue<br />2) Click on Open Printer Utility (this displayed the printer's web page)<br />3) Click on the Networking tab<br />4) Click on Wireless link on left<br /><br />At that point, I was able to confirm settings that had been established during the Windows 7 install.<br /><br />I then<br /><br />5) Clicked OK on the print queue window<br />6) Closed the print queue<br />7) Deleted the printer from the Print & Scan list by highlighting it and clicking the '-' button<br />8) Clicked the '+' button and selected "Add other printer or scanner"<br />9) Selected "HP LaserJet Professional P1102w" with Kind Bonjour and clicked Add<br /><br />The printer was set up.  I printed a test page from the Mac and it worked.  I revisited the iPad and tried AirPrint, and the printer was displayed.  I printed from the iPad and it worked, too.  (AirPrint probably would have worked once wireless was set up on the Windows 7 machine.)<br /><br />So in summary...wireless setup did not really work on the Mac under Mac OS 10.7, it was only because I had a Windows machine that I could get it to work.<br /><br />Edit...later...I found a procedure that looks like it will allow you to set up wireless on a Mac running Mac OS 10.7.  I will summarize it here:<br /><br />1) Power the printer on,<br />2) Go to the Airport icon on the Mac's menu bar and click on it.  Select the network associated with the HP printer.<br />3) Go into Safari.  Ignore the warning that you are not connected to the Internet.  You aren't, instead you are connected to the web server on the printer<br />4) From the Bookmarks menu, select Show All Bookmarks<br />5) Under Collections, s&eacute;lect Bonjour<br />6) Double click the HP LaserJet Professional P1102w bookmark<br />7) Click on the Networking tab<br />8) Click on the Wireless link on the left hand side<br />9) Select Infrastructure<br />10) Under Network Name (SSID) click Refresh.<br />11) Select your Network Name by highlighting it and clicking the &lt;&lt; button<br />12) Select your Security Mode.  Enter your passphrase if you have one.<br />13) Click on Apply<br /><br />The web  page will disappear.  At this point, go to the Airport icon in the menu bar and connect back to your wireless network.<br /><br />Proceed with Software Update (which, in theory, will install the latest printer driver).  If that does not work, download and install the latest driver from the HP site.<br /><br />If the printer does not show up under Print & Scan preferences, add it as a Bonjour printer, as detailed above.<br /><br />This should take the Windows laptop out of the mix when installing wireless!;;4.0;;June 9, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

This was a top-rated machine, and I was excited when it arrived.  Unfortunately, the particular 8500 that we received, although easy to setup, jammed constantly.  After a week of jamming headaches, I headed online to Amazon to arrange for a return.  When considering a replacement, I saw that the 8600 series OfficeJet printers had arrived, so I needed to consider them as well.  At only about $25 more than I had paid for the 8500, I took the plunge.<br /><br />The first decision with the 8600 was which of the three models to order.  The basic model was quite attractively priced, and has features similar to the Plus and Pro models.  The Plus model's big advantage (in our case) was the larger display.  Other features separating it from the basic model are the larger automatic document feeder (50 vs 35 sheets) and a slightly faster print speed (20 vs 18 ppm black and 16 vs 13 ppm color, according to the HP website.)  Had we upgraded to the "Premium" model, we could have added an additional 250-sheet paper tray.  The Premium model might be appropriate for a small workgroup which does does lots of printing, but in our case, would be extreme overkill based on our printing volumes -- one ream of paper can last us many months!<br /><br />Display: This printer went to my mother-in-law's house - and she's not the most tech-savvy consumer.  We chose the "Plus" model because of the larger display - and it was a great choice!  The display is great - large, bright, and intuitive.  My mother-in-law has no problem completing most tasks and following the very good on-screen video instructions.<br /><br />Configuration: The printer was easy to configure without even connecting to a computer using the on-screen display to connect to the wi-fi network.  In all, it probably took about 10-15 minutes, most of which was allowing the printer to complete its self-configuration checks and print head alignment.  The software was easy to install on the computer, and the computer was able to discover the printer on the network almost instantly using the drivers on the included CD-ROM.<br /><br />Printing: Print quality is quite good and very fast -- the last time I purchased an inkjet printer was about 7 years ago, and the one this one replaced was 8 years old.  Speed has come a long way in that time!<br /><br />Copying: Again, this was quite simple.  I especially like the easy on-screen options for dealing with two-sided originals and copies, allowing for all duplexing options without any additional fuss or difficulty.<br /><br />Faxing: Also a straightforward operation, there were a few points worthy of comment.  First, the fax self-configuration was great, and I appreciated the self-check during the setup process so that sending a "test fax" to someone was not necessary.  Also, it worked fine with the AT&T U-Verse digital phone service -- not all fax devices play well with digital phone services, so this was very nice.  My mother-in-law also commented about how she appreciated that you can enter the destination fax number before inserting the document to be faxed into the feeder - a nice feature as the destination fax number is usually at the top of the front page, which is often hidden by the document feeder once inserted.<br /><br />Scanning: The network scanning was quite easy, and worked seamlessly - something not true of all network scan devices.  My previous experience had been that devices scanning over the network have some usability problems, and that they work best when connected directly to the computer.  No issues here, however - it worked great right out of the box with no physical connection to the computer.<br /><br />Driver: The included drivers on the CD-ROM worked just fine, as well as those downloaded from the HP website.  My one small complaint is that when auto-discovering the printer using Windows 7, Windows fails to install a usable driver.  The user must first go to the HP website, download an appropriate driver, then install the driver directly.  These extra steps were time-consuming and annoying - but not enough for me to deduct a star.<br /><br />Ink: The ink cartridges were very easy to insert and replace.  I particularly appreciate that they are simple units and don't have the tape-covered electrical contacts common on the older generation of cartridges which could sometimes come off during installation.<br /><br />Overall: I give this printer a strong recommendation, and 5 stars.  You may need to decide which model is best for you -- depending on pricing, the larger display of the "Plus" model might not be worthwhile, and the price of the basic model is quite attractive.  For us and our given user, the larger display was key and worth the extra cost.  I'd buy one again!;;5.0;;January 25, 2012;;57;;57;;1.0

I hoped that the 5514 would give me similar results as the others I had owned, but that didn't happen.  Note when you buy an HP that some models have "black" ink and some have "photoblack".  The "black" that the 5514 uses is crappy.  Looks kind of reddish black.  So, what's the big deal that HP couldn't use photoblack?  Beats me. Just don't expect to use the 5514 for all you photo needs.<br /><br />The HP kind of falters, balks, and tends to go into endless cycles in copy mode.  Had to start it, stop it, and repeat this about three times before I could get it to copy. If you're concerned about having a quiet printer, you better not get this one.  It sounds worse than a garbage disposal when you start it up and never gets any better regardless of what mode you use it in.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, HP should give us the 5514 for free.  The software is almost pure advertising.  Nothing useful.  HP used to give you some software (kind of cheesey, but nevertheless, somewhat useful) that you could use for templets.  Now, it's buy this, buy that, on and on and on.  I ended up deleting just about all the software they included.  I've never seen so much advertising come with any product.

First off, it is a remarkable machine that produces superb prints of artwork.  All final digital product is, of course, dependent on the filtering and scanning that the intake and digital manipulation software provide, but the quality of printing for line drawings, ink washes, and similar works really impressed me.  I have not done a lot with photograph reproduction, but what I have done was also impressive.<br /><br />It is not, however, a perfect machine.  The settings process which has to be done per print, or saved as a custom batch setting is cumbersome.  The layout is a bit awkward and makes it difficult to remember to go through every setting and tweak it for your particular batch printing job.  You can establish your own profiles, but not every setting is included in the profile which means you might still have to tweak the settings for even the  minute differences in a batch.  As per tech support, the layout options per print are dependent on the software you are using to order the print job.  The manual paper feed at the rear of the machine is EXTREMELY sensitive to paper being cocked a little to one side or the other (so sensitive that I truly believe it is imagining things).  I am actually completely unable to determine what the problem is in each instance, and simply wiggle the paper a tad in its position, and try again.  The output print is pushed hard against the right side of the machine, which is ridiculous considering the amount of space there is to work with.  It tends to catch on the sundry little irregularities and joints in the plastic located there when using thin/flimsy paper.  Thicker paper seems to glide over it without issue.<br /><br />All in all, I can highly recommend it for quality of output and economy of use (relative use of "economy" here - these are very high quality prints and not dirt cheap), but it is not a 'set it and forget it' producer of batch prints. You do need to stay on it from start to finish.  The last and final aggravation is that if you miss setting a paper-type change that requires matte black ink when you've been using photo black ink or vice versa, it undergoes a purge of the system, spilling all the 'other' type of ink into a waste tray.  This is better than having to change out ink cartridges, but once it begins there is no way to stop it without shutting down the machine mid process which I'm sure is not recommended.  However, if you don't, it will finish purging the one type of ink and then reloading with the other, and will do the whole thing in reverse when you correct your settings.  A phenomenal waste of ink.  There desperately needs to be an "abort" button to halt all processes in mid stride considering how easily you can miss a setting.;;4.0;;July 27, 2010;;33;;33;;1.0

I researched and came up with a few possibilities, and this one got the nod.<br /><br />Her typical use is on the order of 95% "copy machine" 4% computer printer, and 1% scanner. (Scanning is almost always with help over screen share.)<br /><br />This machine is difficult to find in brick & mortar stores. We called them all in her area with no luck... and as there was really no rush, she ordered with the free shipping option... and the machine arrived in about a week. It shipped from the Phoenix area.<br /><br />I helped her set it up via long distance screen share (she's in PA, I'm in CA). I downloaded a copy of the manuals off Brothers web site so I could better "play along". Set up went smoothly with no significant hang up's.<br /><br />She's a Mac 10.7 user, and we discovered no software installation was really necessary. Her Mac already had all the necessary printer drivers, and Apples stock "Image Capture" application nicely handels all the scanner needs. Used as a "copy machine" the machine works independently<br /><br />She reported it prints and copies beautifully... the print dialog box looked complete and straight forward. We did some scans, and they looked great as well. I suspect, but don't know for sure, that the scanner uses LED's as it's illumination source as there was almost zero 'warm up' time required.<br /><br />She said printing was a little noisy but reasonable... and it's unlit display & control panel are both straight forward.<br /><br />Yes, a long distance review, hope it's helpful. I won't even go into her last inkjet printer/scanner that took days to set up, and after that she was never happy or comfortable with.<br /><br />Myself, I have a separate scanner, and Brother HL-2140 stand alone laser printer, of which I'm also very pleased.;;5.0;;June 22, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

Although two things were a bit ambiguous about the instructions.  First, the matter of how it's connected to the network refers to how the printer is connected to the network.  Never mind that your computers may be connected wirelessly to the router.  The printer's connection is all that matters here.  Secondly, even though you may have an infrastructure (central router) based network, choose peer-to-peer as your network type.<br /><br />The software installation was a bit surprising.  While most manufacturers embed a pile of useless software and some rather annoying add-ons like browser toolbars, the Brother allowed a clean and minimalist install.  It was quick and efficient, and it worked.  Just a solitary icon on the desktop that directs you to support if you need it.<br /><br />One aspect of the printer driver that is rarely touched upon in the reviews, is the "booklet" mode.  I've often wanted to print items in a reduced size format that could be carried about easily.  I tested the function and chose a 15 page PDF document to print.  I merely set the printer driver for "booklet - automatic" and it printed perfectly; all of the pages in order, ready to fold and staple.  This is normally something you have to fiddle around with in a word processor to achieve.  For better or worse, the driver reverts to single page printing upon completion.  I like that, I don't want to send a stack of invoices to the printer and have them inadvertently printed as a booklet.<br /><br />Another nice feature that's been overlooked is that the printed pages are delivered to the tray face down.  In other words, in order.  No more sorting them or having to print in reverse order, as is the case with ink jet printers.<br /><br />The thing is blazingly fast; typically done with a job before I reach for it.  Print quality is very good.  Ninety percent of my work is in monochrome (or could be) so by having a dedicated black and white printer will save me a great deal of supplies.  Most color printer drivers don't give you an option of using the black only.  I'm sure everyone has experienced printing a flashy web page with a color ink jet printer and have the pages come out laden with ink and noticeably damp from printing all of the useless advertising and background colors.  Even more maddening, it now refuses to print a black and white document claiming the yellow has run out.  With this monochrome printer you don't have to worry about it.<br /><br />A number of reviews have commented on it's power consumption.  First there's the allegation that it's draws so much power that the lights dim in the house.  The problem here is that your building needs to have it's wiring upgraded.  In any case, the printer shouldn't be plugged into a circuit that also supplies room lighting.<br /><br />Next, there have been comments that it's not really energy saver, seemingly because the power LED remains on in dimmed mode when it's sleeping.  In fact, in only uses 0.9 watt when it sleeping (2.8 watts with WAN on); that's a lot less most modern appliances, such as TV's or microwaves.  Far less than a high speed modem or router.  It needs to consume some power in order to keep it's connection to the network on standby.  You can change the status of the power indicator to "off when sleeping" in the software if it makes you feel better, but why bother?  You can save a lot more energy by vacuum cleaning the coils beneath and behind your refrigerator.  (I know you haven't done that lately.)<br /><br />Finally, it's been stated that it draws 1,000 watts while printing.  Well, inrush perhaps.  But let's do the math based on the 1,000 watts.  In most cases 1,000 watts for an hour's time would cost you about ten cents.  Ignoring the time you'd spend reloading it with paper, and at 25 pages a minute, your cost in energy would be 0.00666 cents per page ($0.0000666).  Pretty cheap, all things considered.<br /><br />It does exhibit a slight "curling" of the paper, particularly when using the duplex mode.  I switched to 24 lb. laser paper to combat this and noticed an improvement in print quality as well.  There is an option in the printer's software that supposedly will reduce paper curl.  I haven't tried it because I feel that the manufacturer would not have the default set to off unless there are performance issues associated with it's being on.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this printer.  For what it's designed for, a SOHO environment, it can't be beat.;;5.0;;January 24, 2011;;28;;28;;1.0

Starting with ink tank issues, at 15 bucks a pop couldn't they have made the tanks a little larger ? With 10 tanks, each being used at a different rate, it feels like at every print attempt one of the tanks will run out. At these prices and with this number of tanks I can't afford to have a bunch of spares lying around and these inks are hard to find in local stores meaning they have to be bought online, which can mean a delay of several days to produce a print.<br /><br />I have also found the startup time for the printer to start printing to be a little annoying and wondering if I have just got a 'bad' one in this case. I did some timings from pressing the print button on my computer to the thing actually starting to print and it averages around 4 minutes. Can hear the print head moving back and forth multiple times accompanied by various other 'whirring' and 'chugging' noises. No idea what exactly it is doing or whether this is typical.<br /><br />Last, and biggest, issue is the color reproduction which I have found to be completely hit-and-miss. I have my computer monitor calibrated and use only genuine Canon inks and paper but have found the print results to be very unreliable particulary in the red-pink-orange range. Seems to have major problems with color reproduction for photographs with dusk/dawn alpenglow type light. My results in these type of situations haave been of very washed out colors and a major loss of detail. In these cases I have ended up sending the pics to a pro print shop where they have printed fine without any color correction. Up-shot of this is this printer has become nothing much more than a very expensive test printer for me and I end up sending most of my prints to the pro shop.<br /><br />Oh and Canon customer service sucks : unknowledgeable, arrogant and completely un-helpfull.<br /><br />Update - as of today I have given up on this thing completely and put it in the dumpster. Considering the price paid and money spent on ink and paper this has to go down as my worst ever purchase. Had degenerated to the point that only the magenta ink tank seemed to be coming out on prints and no amount of head cleaning would remedy this. On previous experience with the Canon service department I would guess that it would be more than it's worth to send it to them for servicing. It really is hard to see who this product is aimed at. To prevent print heads clogging and needing to be cleaned (using $$'s of ink) it seems that it needs to be used on an almost daily basis, which only makes sense for professionals selling prints, but the tiny size and huge cost of the ink tanks would seem to prohibit this.;;1.0;;January 10, 2011;;12;;16;;0.75

I just tried my new printer and it pumps out the copies as fast as it reads them in using the ADF - no delays. I know what he means - the printer is constantly chick chicking away between print jobs  and I think the doc says it can do that in the middle of the night (so don't unplug this machine) - all to keep up good print quality, which so far is GREAT. I'm selling my HPs and have this and a DCP-J125 from Brother - all in hopes of reliable printing with ability to use generic cartridges. I was pulling my hair out with HP in that dept and refuse to pay so much for HP cartridges, PERIOD.  So this machine so far prints, copies and scans well and I got the fax to work inbound and outbound using our Ooma VOIP system (just have to do *99 before outgoing fax number). Haven't tried wireless yet as we connect our other PCs via the house network which works great after you 'share' this printer. This is a huge printer though - wish it was smaller.  I love that this does easier duplex than the DCP-J125, and this printer does booklet printing - all very valuable. Check out LC-75 cartridges at ldproducts.com.<br /><br />Update: I originally installed this with USB cable to home desktop - that worked fine with the "home network"/shared printer setup. This past weekend I reinstalled to take advantage of wireless - for two reasons 1) don't have to walk up or downstairs to turn the PC it was connected to "on", 2) use the Iphone app. I just reinstalled and followed the instructions (infrastructure setup I believe) and it connected fine wirelessly to my desktop - could fax and scan as well. It appears you have to install the whole (big) MFL Suite on each laptop. I did that on my Vista laptop and got 2 "specified port does not exist" errors - tried adding some ports per the instructions but got that error three times. I could see the printer in "Network" and right click and get its IP address. There is, in All Pgms / Brother / MFCJ425W folder an uninstall pgm that I used each time - also installing it again seems to do some uninstalling to begin with. Couldn't get around that error and couldn't choose the wireless printer when I went to print. Call Brother - they sent me the "solution" which is basically "good luck". Googled network printer problem and found some info - followed that to "add printer" / Wireless or Network / Don't See Printer I Want and then used the IP address to add the printer. That went fine and all of a sudden there it was and could be used...  Then I went to daughter #1's Win 7 machine - that installed no problems and works.

Actually I think of it every time I have to buy replacement ink cartridges.  Well, I was in Office Depot and getting ready to buy a $[...]dollar package of cartridges (4 cartridges) and went over to look at the laser offerings.  I really like lasers but wanted a color laser and REALLY wanted a wireless version.  Was looking at the HP's but they were $$ when I saw the Brother HL-3070CW. (*Technical note: the Brother is not actually a laser but uses LED technology.  I came across this fact in a review site in the UK.  They say that this technology might actually be more accurate than the laser technology.  Hope I got that right.) It was everything I was looking for and more...it was Mac friendly!  Office Depot was selling them on sale for $[...] + tax.  I put back my ink jet cartridges and went home and started searching the net for reviews.  Well, it's a pretty new printer so not a lot out there but places I read said that it was a good home solution.  Went to Amazon and of course they had it and the reviews were good.  Oh yes, Amazon's price was $[...]and free shipping ( it is free standard shipping but I took them up on their Prime trial membership so I would get it in 2 days...pretty sweet) and of course no tax.  I figure I save about $[...] by buying from Amazon and of course there is the $[...] I saved by not buying replacement ink jet cartridges so my price came down to $[...].  Yeah, I know a bit of rationalization there but hey.  Well, UPS came 2 days later and I was in business.  First, the unit is very well packaged.  Oh yeah it's heavy too....49lbs I believe.  Notes: it comes with "starter" cartridges.  They get you going but don't have as much toner as a replacement cartridge.  Still I think they have a lot of life.  Also, no usb cord if you are going to go that route but I bought it specifically for wireless so no biggie.  It does come with an install disc that has both Windoze and Mac drivers along with the complete manual.  The quick setup guide also includes directions for setting up in both environments.  Hooray for Brother!  I was excited about getting this thing up and running but after looking at the quick start guide reference to wireless setup I stopped and thought to myself, "eeeewwww, this may be harder than I thought".  Well, I did some "R&D" (that's Research and Delay) but came back to it a day or so later when I had some time and the house was quiet.  I followed the quick start guide and their recommended method of setting up the wireless connection.....ethernet connection (yes, you need your own ethernet cord as the unit does not come with one) from the Brother to your router and install through wireless computer (old G5 in my case).  Directions were clear and was able to get up and running in very little time and the "first" time.  I believe that other reviewers have said that this was not clear and/or a bit difficult.  I had no problems you just have to know what kind of security you have on your router, and basically the password.  If your router supports "AOSS", "Wi-Fi Protected Setup", or "Secure Easy Setup", things are probably even easier.  Installed the drivers on both my G5 and wife's iBook and everything worked!  This doesn't happen to me very often so I was overjoyed.  My wife is loving this printer.  She's out in the living room and hit's "print" and the Brother wakes up and starts printing.  Print speed is quite sufficient for our needs.  Quality seems very good.  We've only printed out documents with color printing and everything is very crisp.  When you first install it you can print out a demo page that is just awesome!  One thing you might want to remember is paper.  Brother recommends laser paper that is 20-24lbs.  Think I'm using some copy paper that is 20lbs and think my next purchase will be 24lbs paper.  The unit holds 250 sheets in a paper tray below and has the ability to print envelopes and other stuff using a straight through path.<br />  Lastly, everything I've read indicates that the cost of ownership of a laser is better than an ink jet so that's a plus.  Print quality is top notch.  Wireless is the way to go.....happy happy.  I'd heartily recommend this printer to friends and even family.  GO FOR IT!<br /><br />28 Aug 10  ......Update<br />  Just wanted to add that this printer is playing well with a bevy of new laptops.  My eldest son when home from UGA (GO DAWGS!) connects up wirelessly with his Lenovo laptop (Win 7).  My wife's ancient iBook died a couple of months ago and was replaced with an ASUS UL50Vt-A1 running Win 7.  Connection was easy and it works great.  I recently purchased a Sony VAIO VF111FX/B running Win 7 and it too was a piece of cake to get up and print wirelessly. NOW, I'm at the stage where I'm looking at replacement toner cartridges to replace the "starter" cartridges.  Be very careful when ordering and don't be confused between toner and drums.  Amazon has a four pack of drums but you'll need toner before you buy drums so be careful and order correctly.  I'm looking at buy some remanufactured non oem toner cartridges....a four pack for around $[...].  If anyone has a suggestion as to where and how much for a four pack of toner I'd love to hear.;;5.0;;January 10, 2010;;24;;28;;0.857143

We have a Windows 7 laptop, OSX 10.8 laptop, and a OSX 10.7 workstation.  The Windows setup was fairly easy - but I didn't use the included CD because it was OLD.  You can download the latest software from Brother - you have to download the main driver package (about 130MB) and then the ControlCenter update package (about 45MB).  Upon install it finds the printer (which had already been setup on our wireless network), and installs the drivers.  The included CDROM does NOT contain software for OSX > 10.7, so you'll have to download it anyway.  Brother's download website isn't very clear about which files you NEED versus the other 6 files that you don't really need.  Grab the first two at the top of the page - the "CUPS" driver and the TWAIN driver - the first is for printing the second is for scanning.  DO NOT CONNECT THE PRINTER TO YOUR COMPUTER YET - heck, don't even turn it on.  Install the software packages and just for fun reboot so you force the CUPS daemon to restart.  Once you are all booted connect the printer USB cable to your computer, then power on the printer.  Your Mac should automatically setup the printer and you're ready to go.  Configuration on the Mac Laptop was a little more detailed - we had to configure a static IP on the printer and setup an IPP config for the printer in the Mac settings - but it DOES work.  I would hope that Brother is developing a new version of the automatic installer that will work on 10.7 and 10.8.  Also, if you want to print on CD/DVD/BR you'll have to download a newer version of the NewSoft software, a link is available on the Brother website.;;4.0;;August 29, 2012;;5;;6;;0.833333

Each one promised bigger & better things.  But in the end, what it came down to was:  does it print when I press the print button?<br /><br />The HP DeskJet 1000 does.  It is very simple to plug & play (no CD required and the drivers are all easily found online if you need them).  The ink is reasonably priced & you can refill your own cartridges (unlike Lex$Mark who charges more for stinkin' ink cartridge than it costs to fuel my car up for the year).  I bought this printer in February 2011 and just now (September 2011) ran out of ink.  This is with printing a few pages a week, black and white, basic quality.  I have printed a few full-color "photo quality" items and honestly, they looked just as good as the expensive printers I've owned.<br /><br />The only reason I'm marking it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I've not been able to figure out a way to change the print settings to be "fast draft/low ink" so, though the cartridges last a reasonable amount of time for my light use, they would last longer (and print faster) if I could just get it to zip out the most basic print (like when I want to print up a recipe really quickly or a quick homework assignment).<br /><br />The paper doesn't jam, ever (unlike the other brand I owned).  It's simple to understand the instructions, the ink can be found for a reasonable price, there doesn't seem to be any chip on the cartridge that says my printer is out of ink long before it really is.  This is actually the first printer I've owned in the last couple of years that I've found it more economical to buy a new cartridge than it would be to buy a whole new printer (which usually includes TWO cartridges).<br /><br />It's not wireless, but I'm able to share it on our home network through Windows 7 Home Premium, so no problem there. It doesn't have a bunch of bells & whistles, but I don't need them.  I just wanted a printer that printed when I press the "print" button, didn't cost a bundle to purchase OR maintain and lasted for more than a few months.<br /><br />The HP DeskJet 1000 is exactly that, so I'm happy. :);;4.0;;September 8, 2011;;8;;9;;0.888889

I'm thrilled with this printer. Absolutely thrilled. I can't believe I have such a great printer at such an affordable price.<br /><br />I have a low-end Canon printer at home, another in my art studio and two others in my design classroom and I was searching for a Canon when I was researching large format printers. I am very impressed by the sturdiness and reliability of all my Canon printers and very satisfied with their ink cartridge system and wanted to stick with the Canon brand.<br /><br />I haven't printed photos yet--but will. (Using CS3--well, soon CS4). Right now, I'm using the printer to print images from a topographical map program. I'm scaling up portions of the maps into other media and I was becoming frustrated with the limitations of a 15" laptop screen and an 8.5 x 11" print. Now, I'm using a 30" Apple Cinema Display and printing on 13 x 19 paper and experiencing printing nirvana.<br /><br />I'm using 24 lb bright white bond that I got from an internet source; just search for "13 x 19" paper and you'll find a wide range of paper at good prices.<br /><br />I do like that the printer completely closes (good for dust control) but nonetheless I made a custom cover for it, partly to camouflage its bulk. As others have noted, the printer is BIG, so allow for a wide stand and plenty of room for the front and back paper trays.<br /><br />Three tips:<br />First, I did have some trouble learning how to use the front sheet loader. Silly me, I thought the paper would feed from the front and exit the back, but instead, you manually feed the paper from the front toward the back and the printed sheet then exits the front. Once I understood the paper path, I did appreciate that the printer drivers prompt you to insert the paper, press the front feed button, etc.<br /><br />Second, if you want to use the auto feed for 13 x 19 paper (for proofing, or if, like me, you're printing chart-type output on bond paper) note that the auto feed only supports paper up to 12.95 x 23 inches (even though the paper feed is wide enough to handle 13" media.) To print on  13 x 19 paper, just set up a custom paper size of 12.95 x 19 and print away.<br /><br />Three, although the specs say the printer will print on lighter weight paper (17 lb, if I recall correctly) I wouldn't use anything less than 24 lb if you're going to use the auto feeder. I just feel that there is a good chance of paper jams with lighter weight paper.;;5.0;;January 7, 2009;;15;;16;;0.9375

This is also known as a 4-in-1 printer, as it prints, scans, copies, and faxes.  The fax part works both incoming and outgoing.<br /><br />2) Photo print quality is simply excellent, as with all Canon inkjet printers.  I had an HP that cost almost as much and it not only lacked many of the MX870's functions but printed photos rather poorly.  That's what made me come back to Canon.<br /><br />3) Text print quality is very good.  I use my cheap (under 70 bucks) Brother laser monochrome for text printing.<br /><br />4) Canon is the company that started using individual inkjet tanks which is convenient and may save money.  I say "may" because inkjet cartrdiges are cheap nowadays so having individual tanks is no longer a big cost advantage as it used to be.  Still, the convenience is worth something.<br /><br />5) You can do double-sided scanning, copying and printing.  Both source and output can be double-sided.<br /><br />6) Initial setup took me 10 minutes mainly because it was a pain to remove all the orange protective tape as well as install the print head, which comes sealed in a separate package and not pre-installed.  Installing the first ink tank was a little scary but after that it was a breeze to install the other ink tanks.<br /><br />7) Software installation, on Vista and XP, took about 15 minutes for the Easy Install option.  I connected this to one laptop using USB and the other laptops (XP and Vista) via wi-fi.<br /><br />TIP: if you have a Vista or Win7 PC, use that PC to set up the initial wireless function on the MX870.  Vista and Win7 have this awesome Windows Connect Now feature which makes wireless setup of the MX870 a complete breeze, no matter how your wi-fi network is configured.<br /><br />You only need to set up the wireless function on the MX870 once.  You do need to install the printer driver and turn on wireless printer connection on each PC, but the software installer takes care of that.<br /><br />8) Canon's software suite is just great, making scanning and printing very easy to carry out.  This is something that really distinguishes Canon multi-functions from other brands.<br /><br />9) I did a lot of research before settling on this Canon and I've been very happy with all aspects of it.;;5.0;;May 7, 2010;;23;;24;;0.958333

Here's how I would rate the various parts:<br />- Printer = 5 stars<br />- Scanner = 4 stars<br />- Fax = 3 stars<br />- Interface panel = 2 stars<br />- Wireless = 2 stars<br /><br />The touch panel interface is nice, but the manufacturer needs to re-examine the layout and choices. Had run out of color ink and had a very hard time getting it to allow an incoming fax. You can select options on outgoing faxes but not for incoming faxes (how hard can a "black only" option be?).<br /><br />As for the wireless, I've found it to be hit and miss. Sometimes it works fine and other times it just goes away and you have to turn the unit off and back on. It may be there there is some timeout feature, but I can't find a setting to tell it to just stay on. The manufacturer may have tied it to the "power saver" feature and when the unit goes to sleep the wireless just goes away.<br /><br />Epson has always been a great printer. With the correct paper (laser paper won't work right here!) you get a high quality document. As for the scanning features, I've found that it works best when you run it from the computer (using Windows). When you try to go from the scanner to the computer it can never find it.<br /><br />Must admit I haven't tried some of the other features for connecting flash cards and such.

I bought this printer to replace a very old, outdated HP printer and a scanner that doesn't work on Windows 7.  At first, I was marginally happy with the printer because it printed nice photo images and the scanning was simple to use.<br /><br />The problem came when I ran out of color ink.  Not all of the colors, just one.  (The colors come in three individual cartridges).  No problem, I think, because I don't really need to use the color as this printer's primary function is scanning documents and printing black and white text documents.  I am a college student and I rely heavily on those two functions.<br /><br />Well, when the color ink ran out, I found out that I could not print in black and white either.  You must replace the color cartridges in order to use the black ink.  I also could not scan using the standard method.  I found a way around the scanning problem but could not adjust what I was scanning unless I added the color ink.<br /><br />In the mean time I went back to using my outdated HP which thankfully lets you print in black no matter what.  You can even take the cartridge out and shake it to get every last drop out.<br /><br />I finally get some color ink and install it.  I go to print a black and white document and it prints blank.  I am confused.  I check the ink levels and they are fine.  All the colors are full and the black ink is about 3/4 full according to the picture.  The printer tells me to clean the nozzles which uses ink.  I do this and it corrects the problem, but now it shows that my black ink is down to 1/3 full!!  Where did all that ink go?<br /><br />It will be no time at all before I will have to replace the black ink again!  In the year that I have had this printer, I have printed more on my old, outdated HP (maybe not so out of date afterall).  This epson is basically reduced to a humongously bulky and temperamental scanner and is not worth the beaucoup money that I have spent in ink.;;1.0;;April 27, 2011;;32;;32;;1.0

This is being used to supplement a high end Ricoh color MFP at my office that goes on the fritz from time to time and leaves with 100% down when it does.<br /><br />Bought for under $200 here at Amazon, took one day to receive (overnight). Un-boxed and set-up in less than 45 minutes. THE KEY to success in set-up is doing things per the instructions, in order. CD install, driver install, then plug in, add ink, continue with set-up instructions. I am running a Lenovo T61 (XP Pro SP3) here at the office with, from time to time, a MacBook Pro (OSX 10.6.4), so I set-up both laptops to print, scan, email, "N" Wireless network, etc. The copy, scan and print quality is as good as any other inkjet that I have worked with, the last was a HP6180, died with the "yellow cartridge of death" syndrome, to me it was a total waste of money.<br /><br />This has some really great tools under Lexmark Smart Solutions, scan to emails, scan to Mobile Me, print graph paper, etc., pretty cool, online set-up of this customization was a breeze. Lexmark offers a cartridge recycle program online when you register the printer that provides free return shipping and a free cartridge for every 5 you recycle or buy from them, price is the same as the big 3 office centers. Good idea. Register this device, the warranty is second to none and service was great. I had an online chat before receiving the printer (order placed, not delivered) and I was concerned that one reviewer wrote that they "hate" this printer since it does not scan using Apple OSX 10.6, NOT TRUE. Tech support assured me it would work, ok. I have an Intel based 10.6.4 MacBook Pro, scan looks great (first thing I tried)....maybe the other reviewer did not set-up properly, or they are using 10.6.4 with a PowerPC processor (possible?). The card scan to Outlook works great too, I collect a certain amount of business cards in my day to day and used to hate typing info into Outlook by hand...now, using XP, I can scan them all in automatically, works great.<br /><br />Regarding print costs.....it is on average with ALL other inkjet printers, black is a bit less expensive. I know printers, I worked for and now support one of the largest printer manufacturers in the world and print costs are dependent on what you are printing, the type of paper you print on, and the coverage.<br /><br />Overall, a robust printer with today's technology being utilized across the product.

It works to print one document, but then goes to sleep.  Once it is asleep, my Mac is not able to wake it up.  I have to reach behind the printer, unplug it, and plug it back in every time that I want to print anything.  And on top of that, it will add on 5-10 sheets with random words to my print jobs, wasting both paper and toner.  I have talked to the tech support people, as well as customer service people, from Samsung countless times.  I have had several tech support people tell me that the waking from sleep problem is a known issue, but there is currently no fix.  It is a firmware issue with Macs, and the newest firmware does not address this problem.<br /><br />All I asked was that they exchange it for a comparable model that does not have this issue.  The tech support people seemed to think that that was a reasonable request, and I have been forwarded to their "Executive Customer Relations" department many times.  Finally one person said that I needed to have the printer looked at by a service center before I would be eligible for an exchange.  I drove it the 20 miles away to the nearest authorized service center, and they found exactly what I expected.  When plugged in to their Windows machines there was no issue.  They also told me that this firmware issue with Macs was something that they have run in to before.<br /><br />After I got it back from the service center, I talked to someone who said that they had approved my case for an exchange and that someone would call me from the appropriate department.  That person called me while I was at work (because most of the non-tech support departments seem to keep hours only during the middle of the day when all of the rest of us are at work) and left a message saying that I should call him to set up an exchange for a new printer of the same model.<br /><br />WHAT!?!?!  I don't want the same model because it will have the same issues.  SO... I called the number that he left me and it took me to the exec customer relations people.  Again, they told me that someone from the exchange department would call me back.  And THEN I HEARD NOTHING.  So I called back again.  And was told that the approval for my exchange had been withdrawn because all I needed to do was install the newest firmware and it should work.  Well by this point I was STEAMING!!  THEY CANCELED MY EXCHANGE??  WHO DID?  NO ONE TOLD ME!?<br /><br />Of course the firmware that I downloaded and tried again was the exact same firmware that I had already tried.  So I called back and finally got a tech-support person to put me in the que for the product support rep for this model.  And at this point I am just waiting for this person to call me.  I have been waiting weeks to hear from him, and it has been over 2 months since I got the printer.<br /><br />The moral of my rant is that Samsung's tech support is AWFUL!!!!!  Just flat out awful.  They have been rude to me, they don't return calls when they say that they will, and they are making me jump through a ridiculous number of hoops to get to talk to anyone that will help me.  I should have just mailed it back to the original seller, but my dealings with the Samsung support jokers has pushed me past the 30-day exchange limit.  At this point I basically have a 15 pound paperweight in my office, for which I paid $100.  This is my last Samsung purchase,for fear that any time something does not work they will leave me high and dry.;;1.0;;August 21, 2010;;22;;26;;0.846154

I walked into Wal-Mart, and it was selling for $38, and I got a "free" printer with it. It's steal at this price. Amazon should match this price.<br /><br />The printer prints out very crisp and clear printouts.  IT didn't require  It can print photos as well.  I recommend you print from the included software for the best color matching, and use photo paper.  You do NOT need a little LCD screen on a printer, if you are just going to print from a computer anyway.<br /><br />Since I got this for the scanner feature, the printer feature wasn't too important.  It scans very at good resolution, and reasonably quick.  It's a low-end scanner, so don't expect it to scan film negatives, but at $38 I cannot complain.  The scanner software was comprehensive, I did not find it very intuitive.<br /><br />If you must get more bells and whistles like a memory card reader, a puny LCD, and wifi, get the higher end model like the Canon PIXMA MG6120. But don't spend more than $100 for a new printer, these inkjet printers aren't really durable overall from my experience with printers, and new technology wall always come out later.  Plus, these are design only occasional printing, and the quality will not match real photos printed on photo paper from a lab.  Inkjet printer printouts will fade and discolor with time, and they are not waterproof.;;4.0;;August 23, 2011;;125;;134;;0.932836

I did quite a bit of research before buying, and am very happy so far with the printer.  It prints well, scanning is a snap, and it's very handy now having a fax at home, since I have a number of document recipients who prefer fax to email.<br /><br />I really like being able to fax without actually printing a document out -- the fax function shows up as an available printer, so to send a document, whether pdf or Word or Excel or PowerPoint, all you have to do is click the print button and select the Canon fax as the destination printer.  A window pops up asking for the phone number.  Enter the phone number from the computer keyboard, hit "enter" and ZIP -- the printer dials and faxes the document directly from the computer file with no intervening paper copy.  Paperless faxing is VERY handy!<br /><br />The automatic duplex is also handy but very slow -- it prints one side, then sucks the page back in to print the other side.<br /><br />It appears to be a bit more frugal with ink than the old DeskJet it replaced; I've not yet put in new cartridges but the ink indicator says I've used about a quarter of the pigment black and negligible amounts of the dye tanks.  With the older printer, I'd have used about half the black and a quarter of the color tank after the same amount of time -- and with this printer, I can change out individual color tanks instead of the entire cartridge when I run out of one color.  Ink cartridge costs, both for the black and for the color set, are comparable to OEM for the HP and a little lower for non-OEM.  As a rough estimate, it looks like my per-page costs will be about 75% or so of what they were with the DesdJet.<br /><br />I'd read several comments about the footprint, but although the printer is much more massive and bulkier than the DeskJet, the two-dimensional footprint on the desk is virtually the same.  The DeskJet had a large base with a fairly small upper body, while the Canon is much more cubic.  It therefore seems much bigger and more in the way.  Though it doesn't take many more square inches of the desk surface, it consumes many more cubic inches of volume and is easier to bump into.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with the print quality, ease of use, and functionality.  I can't address photo printing since I've not done any yet.  I don't know if it will last 12 years or even 12 months, but no regrets on the purchase as yet.<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />ADDENDUM after five months of use:  I've now run about 400-500 pages through the printer of Office Depot recycled paper.  I've seen some complaints about jamming with inexpensive paper, but the only feed problem I've had is the ONE time the printer took two sheets of paper at once.  I had let the supply tray get down to near-empty, and the printer grabbed the last two sheets at the same time.  I also now have a handle on ink costs, and I'm VERY happy.  My HP InkJet used HP 45 black and 78 cartridges; a set of both ran about $70 OEM and about $50 for off-brands and refills -- and the off-brands and refills had about an 20% failure rate, so they weren't any cheaper than HP name brand cartridges.<br /><br />I just now changed out the black pigment tank and two of the color dye tanks -- using off-brand cartridges I ordered from an online discounter for just over $7 each (about $36 for a full set vs $50 for the HP).  They work perfectly with no streaking, spotting, or missed spots.  After three weeks of use, I'm using the off-brand no more quickly than I used the Canon brand -- and I got about 50% more pages using the Canon "fast" setting than I did with the HP "draft" setting.<br /><br />Cheaper ink cartridges that print more pages -- I LOVE saving money on ink.  It looks so far like my ink costs could be about half what they used to be for the same print volume.  It will be nice not to spend as much on ink every year as I did for the printer.<br /><br />My only annoyance is caused by my fairly low print volume.  I print 20-30 page jobs about 5 or 6 times per month, with one or two page jobs about twice a week.  That means the printer may be in use daily for a few days, but it also means it might sit idle for four or five days at a time.  After an extended idle time, the first print job may not start until the machine takes about 3 or 4 minutes to clean the cartridges and do other "internal maintenance."  I guess the cure would be to print more often, but it's a very minor and occasional annoyance.<br /><br />So, after six months of use, I'm still very happy with the printer and would definitely purchase again.;;5.0;;May 15, 2011;;51;;52;;0.980769

I'm replacing a Dell 1600N Multi Function Printer. While I generally liked the Dell printer over the years, it didn't play well with Mac.<br /><br />To give you an idea how this was set up, let me describe it briefly. The Brother was installed in my home network via an Ethernet cable to my Apple Time Machine.  My iMac is hard wired to the Time Machine and I also have a MacBook that lives a wireless life.  The installation instructions that came with the printer were quite clear and I followed directions for a "Wired Network for Macintosh".  The installation and setup to my iMac took less than 2 minutes and worked right away.  I then installed the software in my MacBook and also selected Wired Network. It also went quickly and worked right away.  I use Ooma VOIP for phone service and the registration FAX was sent successfully however I have not yet received a FAX. I should mention that I'm just a regular guy and not a computer guru in any way shape or form.  I just read the manual and followed directions.<br /><br />I should mention that I've only had this printer powered up for a couple hours and my first impressions are very positive.  I've printed one sided and duplex jobs with zero complaints.  I've scanned to my iMac, perfect.  I made a single test copy and it was about 90% on the quality scale (I haven't messed with any sort of copy settings yet).  I printed one envelope.  It came out slightly wrinkled but not enough to not use it.<br /><br />A few words about printer noise.  I don't think it is objectionable at all.  My old Dell printer would run/hum for 30 minutes after a print job and was quite annoying.  This printer powers up with an incoming job, prints it with minimal noise and then puts itself to sleep.  Yes, you can hear it run but I don't find it overly loud and certainly quieter than my old printer.<br /><br />Time will tell but so far, I'm very happy with my purchase.;;5.0;;April 19, 2011;;55;;57;;0.964912

This isn't a showstopper for me, but it's irritating at times and worth noting.<br />- Noisy. The operation noise and fan is fairly loud, much louder than inkjet and louder than some older lasers I've used. And the fan runs for quite a while after you print. But I'll note that much of the operation noise comes from the duplexer -- it's quieter without it. I don't think noise will be an issue in a large office environment, but in a small room it might be an issue.<br /><br />If you want WiFi and Fax, look at the similar but much pricier MFC-7860DW. I think it's pretty much identical except for the addition of those two functions.;;5.0;;January 19, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

Since the Airport Express does not have an outbound ethernet cable port, I wanted to set up the printer wirelessly from the get-go. I wasn't able to find a clear answer as to whether this was possible, so I decided to take the risk and try it. I was pleased to find that the printer set up on the incuded CD has an option for "Set up without cable," and following the directions in that method proved to be relatively simple. The only snag was that the printer's wireless feature needs to be turned on before it will connect with the router, and that took a little bit of finessing (you need to hold down the "GO" button for 15 seconds, something I had to figure out using Google).<br /><br />Ever since I got it going (not once connecting it to my laptop with a USB cable), it has been working wonderfully. I am a law student and frequently use it to print double-sided (duplex) pages, to cut down on waste -- not to mention the amount of paper I need to physically carry. Printing duplex pages on a Mac is a breeze, as the "two-sided" option is located under "Layout" in Word and other applications.<br /><br />The included cartridge is said to print 3,000 pages, and additional cartridges are capable of printing 8,000. This printer has already saved me the considerable hassle of using the printers at my school's library, and over time, it will also save me a great deal of money.<br /><br />For me, the convenience of being able to open up my laptop and print wirelessly as soon as I get home, combined with the duplex feature, make this printer well worth the investment.;;5.0;;November 15, 2009;;13;;13;;1.0

Yes, this switch was a "bit of a step-down",  but it has all the bells and whistles I need in a home office printer.<br /><br />My MX7600 had developed a problem where it started printing a black stripe down the back of each printed sheet.  I performed every cleaning I could and tossed the ball to Canon Tech Support (who have always performed admirably for me).  They told me that sometimes the felt pads that sit down somewhere deep in the innards of the printer get loose and start depositing ink on the transport rollers.  Since my MX7600 was out of warranty, Canon Tech Support referred me to our local authorized repair center.  A call to the repair center confirmed what I already suspected.  It would probably cost more to repair the printer than it would to purchase a new one.<br /><br />The MX7600 had some "annoyances" I never really liked, so rather than buy the very most expensive injet multifunction all-in-one Canon printer I could find, I opted for the Canon model that had all the features I wanted; multi-sheet scanning via an auto-document feeder, duplex scanning and duplex printing.  I no longer print my digital photos at home, so the photo print quality of the printer was not important to me.  Nor was the ability to fax - although I do, from time to time, fax a document or two.<br /><br />At any rate, the printer was extremely easy for me to setup.  Perhaps that is due to my previous experiences with Canon printers.  I chose to use the hard wired network method since my home wireless network is already somewhat conjested.  Canon gives you three methods to connect your MX882; wireless, wired and USB.  You can even purchase an optional Bluetooth dongle that will allow you to connect your BT-enabled phone or tablet for printing to your MX882.  I should note that the total time to install and configure the printer is about 20 minutes.  Longer than most, but worth the wait.<br /><br />Canon supplies an adequate suite of applications to use with your MX882.  However, the web printing application does not yet support IE9.  So you might want to bypass the installation of that application if you are already using IE9.<br /><br />On running some preliminary tests, I was surprised to find that the MX882 is actually faster than my old MX7600, both in scanning and printing.  And even better, Canon designers seem to have improved the duplex scanning.  On older models, I experienced a 50/50 success rate in duplex scanning.  The MX882 scanned all my duplex jobs without a single jam!<br /><br />They have also improved the MP Navigator application.  The older version I was using with my MX7600 also had some annoyances that were never fixed with updates.  The version that shipped with my MX882 does everything I need it too without constant reconfiguring.  They "smarted" it up!<br /><br />One of the biggest annoyances I had with the MX7600 was the manner in which it handled envelopes.  After many discussions with tech support, they admitted that the MX7600 was meant to be more of a workgroup printer rather than a home office printer.  The MX882 sees when I am printing an envelope and automatically switches to the rear feed tray - just like a well-behaved printer should!<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this purchase and would give it a high recommendation for anyone looking for a first-class home office printer.;;5.0;;August 28, 2011;;11;;11;;1.0

The cartridges are tiny and the printer guzzles ink. It makes noise when you start it up and the tech support person says it is cleaning using a "negligible" quantity of ink to do so... I don't know if that is true or not but it does make quite a bit of noise setting up before the first print.<br /><br />I purchased this printer after extensive research on several sites and reading reviewers. I like the multifunction capability but am overall disappointed with my purchase because of my usage habits. I am a low volume print user. After 1 month of only low usage (probably only around 30-50 pages max with only a few color pages and no photo prints 3 of my ink cartridges are 1/2 full and 2 are 3/4 full. Only the small black shows full.<br /><br />I have the settings on Fast to save ink. I called tech support today and they did inform me that using Duplex printing uses the color cartridges because the color ink dries faster. I wish I had known that. However I am not sure I will meet the following yields the tech support person gave me for mixed text/ graphic prints.<br /><br />He stated the continuous printing page yields are 322pg on the Lg Black, 1250 pg on the small black, 448pg on Cyan, 445 on Magenta, 477 on Yellow, 1370 on Gray. I was told that real life printing will have lower yields (possibly even 1/2 stated quantities) because the tiny nozzles need to be cleaned to ensure they do not get clogged when the printer sits idle between printing times. I know many reviewers have complained about ink usage and I agree wholeheartedly. This is a very expensive printer to run.<br /><br />However, all that said if you are a high volume color user and are looking for very high quality photos or color prints and do not mind paying for the ink usage this may be a printer for you. My mom had a much larger older Canon photo all in one printer (obsolete model) that does not consume as much ink. It has probably 1/5 the print density heads but she is extremely happy with her printer and the quality of the photos, ink usage, etc. The increase in number, decrease in size of the print heads comes with an increase in operating cost.  As long as you are willing to pay for the ink, the printer performs well.<br /><br />A note about the copy machine function. It works well on master copies with white paper but when you copy from a master printed on colored paper it does print a light grayscale background... acceptable but not as nice as taking it to a real copy machine at a Fed Ex office location which only copies the text.<br /><br />If I had to do it over again I would look for a printer less expensive to run. I will probably buy a cheap laser printer and do 90% of my printing there and only use the Canon for special color projects. I don't think I'll ever bother trying photo printing, the cost for the ink alone makes it cost prohibitive for us.<br /><br />Perhaps all the multifunction printers consume ink at a high rate. I just think that a user needs to consider their usage habits carefully before committing to a printer that has such high operating costs. I knew ink consumption would be somewhat expensive but I don't really want to pay $25 a month in ink for mostly black and white prints. It is possible I will get higher yields toward the end of the cartridges or with the next set not using Duplex printing. I will post an update.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/21/2010<br />Switching off duplex printing slowed down the consumption of my color inks; however, after nearly 3 months of low usage (mostly black & white) all my cartridges are at 1/2 with the exception of the page black which is at 3/4. Most of my ink is being used to keep the heads clear which is a waste. If I were a higher print user at least the ink would be on paper.<br /><br />I have changed my opinion on the purchase however. I like having color available and a photocopier at home so I am willing to pay for the ink for the personal convenience. I figure I will need to buy 2-3 sets of cartridges a year. I may be able to cut down my usage by purchasing a laser printer.;;3.0;;July 6, 2010;;7;;8;;0.875

My new MFC-8890DW is no exception.  It's a feature-laden printer that's faster and quieter than the one it replaced.  I especially appreciate the full-duplex printing.<br /><br />I give it one demerit, which probably doesn't deserve the subtraction of a full star.  After following the documented instructions, I couldn't get wireless printing to work when the printer was in sleep (power save) mode.  The included printer monitoring utility showed the printer as "offline", and sending a print job while the printer was in this state resulted in nothing but queued documents.<br /><br />After a web search, I found a FAQ / troubleshooting article about print problems with Windows Vista (I'm using XP), buried on Brother's Canadian site [...].  It provides instructions on how to configure the print driver to use Raw protocol.<br /><br />Why that works, I have no idea, but I can now print reliably whether the printer is online or offline.<br /><br />This is a great machine, and I recommend it, despite this setup problem.;;4.0;;January 28, 2010;;26;;26;;1.0

I have always loved the trouble-free service the 2100 has given me and will some day figure out how to make my 2100 "play well' with the more modern computers.<br /><br />The P2035N was a snap to set up even though the directions supplied were at best minimal. The easy to follow directions were on the supplied CD, though, so I had it up and running in about 20 minutes. Most people have said how loud this printer is, and won't disagree. However, several have said it has a quiet mode which cuts the decibles to about half and only slows down the printing minimally.<br /><br />I found it quite easy to network all my home computers to this printer. I thought it would be a magicical, mystical experience but it took a bit of thinking on my part. I used the install disk on each computer I wanted to network and they all printed to it with no difficulty at all. I'm not a networking genius but it worked perfectly, the first time.<br /><br />Print quality is excellent! Very crisp and very fast. I like the fact the paper tray holds about 250 sheets. I don't expect to have to refill it often. I was told mine has a 'starter' cartridge that will print maybe 800 copies. I did some shopping online and ordered a replacement, compatible with this printer, for just $35. An OEM HP cartridge is about $90, so it was a no brainer what to order. Since a regular cartridge will print over 3000 pages, I figure it's a big savings over the cost of ink for a regular ink jet printer. Ink jet copy smears while laser doesn't- a definate plus for me.<br /><br />Since I've always had exceptional luck with HP products, I don't hesitate in recommending this printer. There's a nice discount at some office supply stores plus HP has a promotion of an additional $50 off if you return any printer when buing this one. So, the price is great, the printer works beautifully, and life is good. Drop what you're doing and get one of these just as soon as you can!;;5.0;;November 20, 2009;;6;;6;;1.0

However, I have been extremely disappointed with this printer.  First of all, it burns through ink cartridges, which gets expensive.  Secondly, I am constantly having to clean the nozzle heads to prevent gaps (which uses even more ink) so that the text on my documents is legible. It's so bad I have to clean them before almost every print job, and even then I rarely get a page to print out cleanly.  Also, the printer has major problems with the paper feed - mostly when trying to print double-sided.  After *every* page I have to push the paper feed button.  Very annoying for large documents.  Finally, when printing photos or anything that has a lot of ink coverage the colors are terrible.  It's been so frustrating I am thinking of forking over for a laser printer.

I know my way around a computer, but am by no means tech savvy. I read instructions, watch videos, everything I can before starting to mess with wires and stuff. This was the EASIEST set up of my life.<br /><br /> When I took the printer out of the box there was a quick start guide (unwrap and plug in, which made me giggle) and then the little touch screen dock sprang to life. It has videos to show you how to insert ink (I was confused by the cartridge, not gonna lie about that!) and paper. The printer then wants you to do a test photo, it's.....kind of loud. But, my printer is maybe a foot away from my face and it's not as if I'm going to start to print something and take a nap. My photo came out ah-maze-ing.<br /><br /> Then it will ask you to pop in the software CD and follow on screen instructions, leading to wireless setup. Now. I am clueless when it comes to wireless settings. I am a fish trying to ride a bicycle. It was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo easy. And yes, that "so" had to be that long for correct emphasis. You do have to know your WEP key or passcode to get it setup (of course) so have that handy.<br /><br /> I will try to come back and update my review after I have used it a few more times to let all of you know about ink use, quality, ect.

It took about 30 minutes to get it set up on the network, due in part to my slow optical drive taking awhile to install the software.  As long as you follow the instructions in the book that comes with the printer and then on the computer when you install the software you should have no problems.  I love the fact that it has E-print(email documents to your printer) so that if there is something I need to print when I am out I can email it to the printer and have it ready when I get home.  It even sends me an email to the same address letting me know that the printing job has been completed.  It also does have security features for the E-print so that it can be set up so that only certain email addresses can use it which is comforting.  I know some people complained that the scanner was really loud but mine makes no noise whatsoever when it scans, I actually thought that it wasn't scanning at all until I looked at my computer screen and saw the image on the screen fully scanned.<br /><br />On the downside it is a bit noisy when it prints and makes some weird noise when it stops printing as well.  It also sometimes manages to push the paper in the tray back so the point that it thinks that it is out of paper so you have to push the paper in the tray forward in order to get it to print.  The good qualities outweigh the bad and make it a pretty good printer, especially for the price range.;;4.0;;August 2, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

Prints from Tablet/Smartphone. AirPrint Compatible (C11CC36201);;So far really impressed!;;This is tentative 5 stars as I just got this today.<br /><br />I am replacing an Epson WF-1100 that was total junk for me, even though it came highly recommended by people in my field. I was leery of trying another Epson, but I need pigment ink and I need something that is made to print a lot of color prints-- I have a lovely Cannon printer, but it's not made for loads of printing and it's mostly dye ink.<br /><br />Things that I really like. It does have a manual paper feed in the back. That was a big must on my list. Based on reading reviews about other Epson connecting the wifi to Macs I was nervous, but it was as easy as selecting my network and entering my password... the two machines did the rest.<br /><br />I also like that it has a really small footprint. I will use the scanner, maybe the copier, but not the fax... so those features aren't relevant to me.<br /><br />I knew it came with the teeny starter ink, but I was bummed that I couldn't buy the high-capacity ink at Amazon yet, I had to go to Epson, but when I registered my printer I got 10% off from Epson's store. Sweet.<br /><br />In my other Epson the color profiles were off I spent a lot of time adding color profiles just to get it to print right. In my test prints with the WF-2540 I have been really impressed with the colors. As good as my beloved Cannon Pixma... which says a lot.<br /><br />It prints fast, as fast as I need, I'm used to slower color printing and didn't mind that, so this is just an added bonus. It also prints quiet. I set this up while my toddler was sleeping in the same room and he didn't even budge.<br /><br />I haven't tried syncing it with my iPad or iPhone, I don't usually print from them, so it's not high on my must-do list.<br /><br />To sum up, I am very pleased that out of the box it does what it's supposed to quickly, easily and with good quality prints.<br /><br />I will update if things change.

Apple heard us and with the release of IOS (iPhone Operating System) 4.2 the company included Apple Air Print a technology that allows, or is supposed to allow the iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch to print wirelessly from the device to an ever-increasing number of Hewlett Packard printers like the HP Envy 100 e-All-in-One D410a Inkjet Printer.<br /><br />Hewlett Packard upped the ante with this All-n-One (AIO) unit by including wireless and giving the "HP Envy 100 e-All-in-One D410a Inkjet Printer" an e-mail address from one can print from your iPad via a technology called "e-Print."  One is also supposed to be able to print wirelessly via Apple Air Print.<br /><br />The Product<br /><br />The "HP Envy 100 e-All-in-One D410a Inkjet Printer" is a small footprint multifunction printing device (compatible with PC as well as Macintosh) that allows you to print, scan, copy all from one unit.  The HP Envy 100 has the added capability of printing photos directly from the unit and will accept input from all manner of removable and or portable memory devices including SD Media, or USB port for connecting directly to a digital camera.  All of these connections are situated on the front of the unit.<br /><br />Wired networking is built into the HP Envy 100 e-AIO; the machine has built-in 10/100 Ethernet port.  Once set up, computers speak directly to the printer abrogating the need for a dedicated print server, or sharing via Windows.  Note: the HP Envy 100 e-AIO can also be connected directly to a PC via a USB cable (not included), in which case its printer functionality can be shared via Windows.<br /><br />Unlike other AIO printers the HP Envy 100 e-AIO is a smaller than usual unit without an automatic document feeder.  Gone as well are (4) cartridges, replaced by (2).  The HP Envy 100 e-AIO also features a flatbed scanner, copy collating, two-sided printing, print up to legal size; and a slide-in 25-sheet input paper capacity.  The HP Envy 100 e-AIO offers print and copy speeds up to 27 pages per minute (ppm) black, and up to 22 ppm color, with up to 4,800-optimized dpi color and laser-quality text.<br /><br />Un-Packing<br /><br />As I stated above, the HP Envy 100 e-AIO is a small unit, and as such it ships in many different parts and had to be put together before use.  It took me a little less than 15 minutes to completely assemble the printer.  Since the printer is so compact there are few moving parts, even the duplexer is built-in.<br /><br />Network Setup<br /><br />Before connecting the HP Envy 100 e-AIO to a computer (USB), or network (Ethernet), the decision must be made to utilize one or the other communications medium, but not both.  But, of course there is one other option: wireless, so I installed the HP Envy 100 e-AIO utilizing wireless and USB and I can print either way. Wireless set-up was effortless using DHCP.<br /><br />Wireless Printing & e-Print<br /><br />One of the selling points of the HP Envy 100 e-AIO is of course the ability of the iPad to print to the device either wirelessly (Air Print) or via e-Print.  For me the first doesn't work, while the second mostly works; let me explain.<br /><br />IOS version 4.2 shipped with Air Print, which allow the iPad to wirelessly "talk" to Air Print enabled printers like the HP Envy 100 e-AIO.  While I could see the printer on the iPad from Air Print enabled applications like Safari, select the printer and the app stated that it was rendering a print job, yet nothing came out of the printer, ever!<br /><br />I Google'd the issue and it turns out I am not the only one with the issue; it appears to be a wide-spread and caused by a combination of wireless access point (WAP)/ Router, printer, and iPad compatibility.  I tried all of the steps outlined in numerous BLOG's on the issue and I have yet to resolve it; (heavy sigh!).<br /><br />On the other hand, e-Print works like a charm, most of the time.  With e-Print the HP Envy 100 e-AIO is assigned an e-mail address to which one can forward e-mail's to be printed from iPad, iMac, iPod, or PC as long as the printer is connected to the Internet.  This feature works reasonably well; it is supposed to be able to print attachments, but this is a hit or miss proposition; i.e. sometimes it works, sometime not, sometimes it print half a page.  Overall, I am pleased with e-print, and of course since I cannot print to the HP Envy 100 e-AIO via Air Print, it is the only way I can print from the iPad.<br /><br />Software Installation<br /><br />To get the most of the HP Envy 100 e-AIO you will have to install the software suite on a PC or iMac, and for this you will need to connect the AIO via a USB cable.  The software will allow one to control features on the printer, as well as download HP Apps, yes I said Apps from the Internet in order to use directly on the printer.  Via HP Apps like Disney you can print out ready to color pictures from the movie Tron; just bring them up from the color screen on the HP Envy 100 e-AIO and hit print. Seriously cool!<br /><br />With the software is installed the workstation will be able to print, scan, and copy from the HP Envy 100 e-AIO.<br /><br />Printing<br /><br />Pretty straight forward; the software installation process installed a full set of print drivers on each workstation, which in turn give you complete control over the printing process, including two-sided printing.  The HP Envy 100 e-AIO can also print from inserted USB flash drives and or SD Media cards.<br /><br />Scanning<br /><br />The HP Envy 100 e-AIO offers up only a flatbed scanner for use, gone is the ADF.  Initialing the scanning process can be accomplished from the included software or the HP Envy 100 e-AIO control panel.  Once an item is placed on the flatbed scanner on the scanner glass surface, you can push the Scan button on the front panel, at which time you choose where to scan to: Computer, USB Flash Drive, or Memory Card. Once a destination is chosen, you can then chose to scan to file, e-mail, or photo.<br /><br />Copy Process<br /><br />This process, like printing is pretty straight forward; both color and black & white copies can be made, up to 99 at a time.  Because there is a duplexer installed two-sided copies can be made in a number of different configurations, including 1-side original/ 1-side copy; 1-side original/ 2-side copy; 2-side original/ 1-side copy; 2-side original/ 2-side copy.  Copies can also be enlarged up to 144%, or reduced down to 25% of original.<br /><br />Working with Photos<br /><br />As stated above, the HP Envy 100 e-AIO will accept input from a number of commercially available portable memory storage devices, slots for which are located on the right hand side of the printer underneath a sliding panel.  Simply insert the memory card and the photos it contains are displayed on the small 2.4" 256 color display in the middle of the OJ L7680 AIO's control panel.<br /><br />Using the square control button that sits to the right of the display, pictures can be scrolled through and then printed on borderless or regular paper.  Pictures can also be shared between users as long as the HP Instant Sharing utility is set up.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Overall I like the HP Envy 100 e-AIO, it is compact, easy to use, and has an aura of coolness that is hard to resist.  Of course its inability to utilize Air Print and print wirelessly from the iPad is a big impediment considering it is what I bought the AIO for.  However, since the e-print is working relatively well, I can excuse the minor, well okay, major bump in the road to iPad nirvana!<br /><br />The built-in wired Ethernet capability, coupled with USB and wireless make the HP Envy 100 e-AIO a versatile, flexible unit that is ideal for a small home office setting and well as workgroup setting; however, with its multitude of family-centric HP Apps, the AIO seems to be geared towards the home user.  If you or your small workgroup need a scanner/ copier/ printer, and need to print from your iPad is some form or fashion the HP Envy 100 e-AIO should be given serious consideration, just be aware of the wireless constraints!;;4.0;;May 20, 2011;;6;;8;;0.75

I'm getting used to the low intensity color, too.<br /><br />I've owned at least three low-cost scanners with 11x17 capability, and I've returned them all because their 11x17 scans looked terrible. The scans from this one are superb. Once you figure it out, the scanning software is very good, too. (In my experience, Brother products come with very good software, but limited information about it.) You can control the scanning from the panel of the scanner or from the included Control Center software.<br /><br />I found the controls on the hardware to be intuitive and easy to use for scanning and printing. (I haven't used it as a FAX machine yet, but the FAX controls appear to be of a similar nature.) Those in the software are somewhat less so, but once you figure them out, they give you a lot of flexibility.<br /><br />I love the fact that I can keep 11x17 and letter sized paper in separate trays that are easy to print from. I love that the unit connects wirelessly to all the stuff in my office.<br /><br />I haven't experienced the serious paper feed problems that others have talked about, but I HAVE had a misfeed or two, and there HAVE been times when the unit seems not to know what I'm asking it to do. When that happens, I just abort and start over.<br /><br />The color printing is definitely unusual, in that the intensity of the colors is very much less than that of other printers I've had. The printer has two color modes: Natural and Intense. Both of them do pretty well at delivering readable color, but it's pretty washed out when compared to what I am accustomed to (mostly H-P). Once I got used to the Brother's lower color intensity, I began to appreciate the fact that it makes a lot of things easier to see and differentiate. I have several small logos with a lot of detail that normally can't be seen when printed in color. It shows up nicely on the Brother, though.<br /><br />The duplexing works well and is easy to use, but it only seems to work on plain paper. I couldn't get it to duplex anything on bright white inkjet.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with this unit. I have two H-P laser printers and three H-P color inkjets in my home office, and the Brother is a useful addition to my capability.<br /><br />UPDATE (2/19/12) I'm getting to appreciate the benefits of the 11x17 scanning bed. One of my occasional projects is to scan some booklets that are printed on 11x17 paper, then folded and saddle stitched. In the past, I only had a letter-sized scanner, so I had to work hard to get the booklets straight on the scan glass. I either folded them back on the saddle-stitched edge and hoped to get them straight, or else flipped the booklet on every other scan then unflipped the alternate scans electronically. Either way was inconvenient, and somehow neither ever worked out very well. I'm doing one of these projects today, and I just open the booklet, lay it on the scan glass, and scan it in 11x17 mode, always with the top edge of the booklet facing into the scanner. There are no alignment problems, since the 17" side fits perfectly flush with the edge of the scanner bed, and more or less "locks in" on its raised edge. This is a tremendous improvement in convenience from what I had before. And as I said up above, the 11x17 scans are VERY clean and nice, MUCH better than anything I've had before.;;4.0;;February 10, 2012;;9;;9;;1.0

I think we live in an age where products tend to not just fall short of expectations in terms of how they satisfy us, but all too often simply fail to operate as they advertise in basic functional ways.  I buy things fully expecting them to have some sort of problem that inevitably disappoints me, typically just basic operational failure that should not happen.  This is all to say I am glad to report this Cannon printer, once again proves Cannon still makes good products.<br /><br />I set this printer up on our Wi-fi network as if it were made for it.  I couldn't believe simply using the printers own menu options and its little 2 inch screen (never touching my computer) would be all I'd have to do to get it up and running and printing/scanning.  Naturally, the printer takes a driver you have to install on any computer using it, but as far as getting it up and running, you don't have to touch your PC.  And the menu options are not obscure DVD player firmware style options.  They are simple, short and well thought out and illustrated steps to help people of varying experience levels set the printer up with absolutely no headache.  There was not a single moment during the printer setup that I did not know what I was doing or where I felt lost or confused.  It was, and it's so rare with computer products, a very pleasant process.  Altogether it took about 30 minutes to set it up, including a somewhat lengthy print head alignment, which is optional but recommended if you plan to print photos.  But, even there the printer did all the work and I just had to facilitate transferring the printed test sheet to the scanner.  Job done.<br /><br />The printer comes with a set of free glossy 4x10" photo sheets.  For the first time in my life, I printed a photo on a home printer.  I was expecting it to look nice, but this was of a quality I would have gotten printing at Walgreens or Target.  It's just that clear and rich in how it prints.  I don't plan to do much photo printing, but I may change my mind considering how well this printer does that.  Document printing is also very nice, but I'd think that should be a given on just about any printer these days.  Something to think about, and this may be common with photo printers, is that you have the 3 standard color ink cartridges, a photo (I believe) black cartridge, and a fifth larger black cartridge for everyday printing.  So, ongoing expense includes 5 ink cartridges.  If you do a lot of printing, I can see where that might get pricey.<br /><br />The scanner works well.  This is the only function of this printer that I think falls short of the rest of the printer, and that's really only because the rest of the printers functions blew me away whereas I find the scanner solidly adequate.  My complaint is that it seems to scan bright, and by that I mean it tends to wash out the document you are scanning.  It's not awful, but a bit too much brightness.  A quick run through Photoshop would be more than enough to compensate, but I know not everyone has that sort of software.  Otherwise, if you just want usable scans of good quality, this printer will make you happy.  If you want perfect scans of the quality of a dedicated "fancy" scanner, I don't believe this one will satisfy you.<br /><br />All in all, this printer is feature-packed and more than lives up to its promises.  I'm pretty cheap, so even getting this on Black Friday for 79 bucks made me squirm, but I can say having it here and setup now, I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />Thank you Cannon for being one of the few companies that still makes quality products.;;5.0;;December 1, 2009;;21;;22;;0.954545

Overall, given the price and features, I would recommend it, but there are a few foibles that hold it back from a perfect score on all factors.<br /><br />Installation was easy enough, as it is with most Brother machines. It set up to a Win7 machine in about 20 minutes. Subsequent install onto 2 other XP machines and three OS X Macs took around 5 minutes each. It is important to read the manuals and follow the instructions because it does get a little tricky in places if you're not paying attention. Print quality is excellent. Copy function is good. Once you've got it set up properly it's good. The duplexing works well, although it sometimes sounds like it's shredding the paper instead of duplexing it. The 'bonus' software is all geared towards colour printers, but might prove useful sometime. Maybe.<br /><br />Now, the negatives: it's noisy when operating. Not obtrusively so, but it's not exactly quiet either. It settles back to sleep mode quickly. The scan function does not generate (as far as I can tell!) pdf files, which is annoying. It will scan in several formats and directly to wireless networked machines, but won't generate PDF's automatically.<br /><br />ETA:  Thanks for the comment below! Yup, I figured it was just me not setting it up correctly for PDFs. It does indeed, as you would expect, generate PDF's automatically. Very small amount of messing about to set up, once you know where to look. Yay!<br /><br /> It is also a pain in a arse to set up to run wirelessly on a Win& network. Once the win box goes to sleep, is shut down, or re-starts for any reason then the Win machine can't see the printer for sending print jobs. Several calls to Brother when this first happened had them get me to uninstall the priter from the Win box and then re-install it. That worked, but only until the next time the Win7 box was shut down...  This didn't happen on the XP or OS X machines, just Win7. Updating the drivers didn't help. Eventually, after three calls to Brother's help desk (which was very nice to deal with but totally didn't suggest the right solution), and spending three hours wading through online forums for a solution did I find out what needs to be done: the default install has one print standard on the Win7 box and another on the machine. You need to go into the Win7 settings and change the printer to RAW so that it matches the printer's internal default setting. Once you do that then everything works perfectly over a wireless network connection for Win7.<br /><br />Anyway, yes: aside from those things, it's all good and hard to beat at the Amazon price of ~1/2 MSRP.;;5.0;;June 27, 2011;;15;;15;;1.0

I loved this printer right out of the box even though it wouldn't talk to all of the computers on our network - or rather it only talked to one or two of the 6 in our network and only one with any reliability. It made beautiful prints in both color and black and white. It was quick once it got done with it's alignment schtick for each job (someone has referred to this process as "licking itself" before and after each print job). I was happy. The print cartridges weren't too expensive and lasted a good long time (the XL cartridges, that is).<br /><br />Then one day - yesterday, in fact, it had an issue that none of the usual tricks fixed - reset the printer, restart the sending computer, remove and put back the print cartridges - so I looked at the cool web portal to find out what the printer thought about the issue. It said that the printhead was incompatible. Now, it had been using the same cartridges for over a month with no trouble, so I was confused. I looked online and found, with difficulty, advise on servicing the printhead assembly. But no joy. Things only seemed to get worse after that. It is going to need a new printhead assembly which costs about the same (within 5 bucks) as a whole new copy of this printer. I got a grand total of 2111 pages printed before this happened, but it took me 150 days longer than the warranty period to get to this problem. So now, after only 2111 prints I have something to add to the local landfill.<br /><br />So I offer this advise to those interested in purchasing this printer in great hopes of not having the same issues I have had: get the extended warranty if it costs less than 20 bucks. My best advise is to avoid the heartache altogether. Don't get used to the lovely prints of this printer only to have to lose it after only 2111 pages of printing.;;1.0;;March 15, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

It has every function you need if you are working with 11x17 paper sizes or smaller.  The software it comes with is great but you need to be somewhat computer savvy to figure out how to use it to its full potential.  I would recommend going ahead and spending a couple extra bucks to get the one with two paper decks.  This one only has one and if you need to switch paper sizes it is a pain.  It is inevitable that you will need both paper sizes.  Also, we already have a copier and fax but this is a excellent backup if one of them goes down.<br /><br />The only problem I really encountered is that it does not have ink cartridges that last very long.  It really needs to have a better ink cartridge for the black ink.  It is also a pain to purchase the cartridges.

I travel a lot and wanted a machine that duplexed so that I would have to carry less paper. After looking through all the reviews and price-points, I decided on the Canon MF8380Cdw.  It has been a great printer to date.  The color is crisp, clear and true, and it duplexes very easily.  I have it directly connected to my desktop which is Windows 7 and it installed without a problem.  The desktop application has made scanning a breeze to use and the quality has been perfect for what I do - brochures, receipts, etc.  The printer is a little noisier then my Oki but nothing that I have to stop talking on the phone for.  And it quickly drops into energy saver mode where it is super quiet.  The various functions are easy to work through and once you know how each one works, moving quickly between scan - print - copy and fax are all very easy.  I send documents to print that vary between standard letter size and A4 size.  I have the A4 set up in the secondary tray which is OK for now; but I will probably go ahead and get the second sheet feeder unit so that I can set it up and leave it.  Right now when the printer turns off I have to reinput the setup information for the type of paper in the secondary tray.<br /><br />I also have a MacBook Pro which is connected via my wireless network to the printer.  This is where my headaches were found.  It was easy to install the print utilities on my Mac but I had to get them from the Canon download site as they didn't come with the printer.  It does have one quirk that I don't like.  When the printer goes into energy saver mode, the Mac seems to loose track of the Canon. When I go to print and it is in energy saver mode, the Mac says it can't find the printer.  Reading further through Canon's site you will find a note that Canon is aware of interface issues with the Mac and they are working on it; however at this time they don't have a solution for the problem.  The only work around I have found is to turn the printer off and then back on and the Mac finds it.  Simply bringing the printer out of energy saver mode won't do it.  It is surprising that I have any Mac problems at all since the Canon is advertised as working with Macs, Apple logo and all.<br /><br />Thus - if you use Windows this is an excellent machine without hesitation.  If you use a Mac and don't mind the inconvenience of sometimes having to switch the printer on and off, its also well worth the value you get for the cost.  I am glad I have mine and can wait for the first update to the printer's software whenever that comes out. Hopefully it comes soon!;;4.0;;March 20, 2012;;10;;11;;0.909091

Lots of orange safety tape tabs on lots of spots on the printer itself. What could have been a simple operation of inserting the ink cartridge carrier was confusing because of the "easy to understand pictographs" explaining what to do. It really was easy to do. The "helpful" instructions  made it needlessly complex.<br /><br />I ignored hard copy installation instructions (I'm a guy, it's against the guy union rules to read instructions, what can I say) Followed prompts as per printer display screen. Instructions claim you must manually disable wireless connection at the physical printer controls to print over the wired network: pick either wired or wireless printing not both. ARRGH! I have 3 desktop machines in my home wired network and 2 laptops plus my iPhone in my wireless network. In spite of what other reviewers said and what the installation instructions claim this printer works perfectly on both wired and wireless networks run from the same router without manually switching print modes (Netgear switchboxes and Linksys WRT54GL wireless router WEP security)perfectly. I installed the Iphone app: Canon Easy Photo Print on my iPhone 3GS and can now print photos wirelesly from my phone. I'm pirnting from my wired desktop, my daughter and wife print from their wireless laptops.<br /><br />PRO'S: Installation was easy using WinXP Pro SP3 printer control panel. Prints clean quick nice looking output. Works simultaneously from the wired network and the wireless network. Copies look great. None of the special Canon software supplied seemed necessary to use as printer or copier.<br /><br />CON'S: Installation software on CD is glitchy and ultimately failed to complete. Canon's own claims about what the MP560 can do seem wrong. Printed instructions that came with printer insist you must switch from wired to wireless mode. This was not true for me. Be prepared to spend a little time working through the install process, it was manageable but not smooth. Canon installation software crashed every time I ran it and never did admit to finding the printer wirelessly. After multiple tries I gave up and detected the wireless printer from Windows which worked perfectly. After rebooting Windows Canon software showed up as installed and has worked great ever since.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'm very happy. I like the MP560, prints great for average home use, both wirelessly and wired. I only tried the scanner in copy mode and it was easy to use, made great copies. Be prepared for a bit of a project using the installation software which is glitchy. Setup and installation instructions are poor. If you can set up your own wireless network at home getting this printer to work will be a breeze. If WEP encryption sounds like a Cold War spy story and you're pretty sure you have a router but not sure what it does do not buy this printer, Get something with better installation software.;;4.0;;December 10, 2009;;37;;38;;0.973684

However, before the first cartridges were fully used (within the first 2-3 months of purchase) two of the color inks clogged the printhead. No amount of running deep cleaning utilities would clear the clogs. The optional light swab as described in help also did not clear the clogs, and the printhead was functionally unusable. This is where the fun starts. In November, 2010,Lexmark made available its 100 series printhead (part # 14N1339) for purchase at its web site, along with ink, as a supply. I was warned of a back-order and I patiently waited a month without complaint for a new printhead. It arrived, I installed the new printhead and for the moment it is working beautifully again. Expecting a recurring problem, I tried to order a back-up for inventory.  The web-site now instructs that an 800 number must be called.  After waiting my turn, I was told that Lexmark will NOT accept ANY orders to purchase that replacement printhead. I was not given any explanation, nor any hope that the printhead will ever be available for purchase again. My statement that I was perfectly willing to wait months did not sway Lexmark. I was told to search for vendors who might have one left in stock. I wasted my time, and found none. Other than the 901 and 905, I do not know whether the same printhead is used in other inkjet printers. It is simply astonishing that Lexmark is continuing to sell printer models, with the knowledge that a printhead is likely to fail but no replacements will be sold. Even if I was given some explanation of a change in manufacturing sources, it would be somewhat understandable, but Lexmark has offered no explanation. Elsewhere in these comments, a Lexmark employee suggested that the commenter contact him.  I tried the same address and received no response. I regret that I did not ship this printer back to Lexmark when the first printhead failed.  Lexmark has not only created questions of credibility and reliability, but more serious questions about its liability for continuing to sell a product for which it refuses to supply replacement parts. There are serious questions about the representations of Lexmark concerning the fitness of this product for its expected and intended use.  My recommendation is that no one buy any Lexmark printers using the printhead series 100 part 14N1339 until Lexmark explains its refusal to sell replacement printheads, and its proposed remedies.;;1.0;;December 21, 2010;;100;;107;;0.934579

The best feature is the wireless faxing. Canon customer support if amazing...fast and took care of a simple issue ( which was operator error not the unit) in minutes...good bye HP...no more ink jet!<br />Super quiet and faster printing than what they stated. The quality of my printing is superior! NO skipped prints even on copies...this baby does not miss a beat.<br />I put 55 pages in to copy...all pages came out in order and perfect...scanner: I scan reciepts into this unit it has not turned or grabbed the thin flimsy receipt like other scanners do...then I tried 60 multiple sizes at one time...still did not skip a beat and all were straight and exactly what I put into the top loader. Fax: sends in color if recipient accepts and fast...no timeout errors like my HP and other units I have tried over the years.<br /><br />I just do not know what else I can say about this unit...I love it and for those of you who are tired of the costly ink jet...welcome to the new world! The replacements are a bit pricey but Amazon took care of that, I found a seller who was competative and free shipping thru amazon...so I bought extras and am ready to roll for my next ???? copies etc.<br />The laser cartridges last a heck of a lot longer than stated...my original factory installed starters gave me over 2500 b & w, and over 1800 color...I honestly think there is more ink left to go on printing.<br /><br />My shipping was fantastic, Amazon shipped my unit within a week as opposed to the 3-6 week wait I was told...cudos to amazon! If you are looking for a totally wireless unit that will print from your 3rd floor laptop to ground level, which is where the unit is...this is your new best friend!<br />So, for all of you that are looking for the best home office (or business) wireless printer...you have just found it and it does not break the bank!<br />Thank you again Canon and Amazon!;;5.0;;December 3, 2011;;86;;86;;1.0

The one I bought recently started having printing issues after less than 100 (average) documents since I purchased it. The toner light keeps blinking or stays on solid and the printer won't print at all.  I called Brother tech support and the tech said that when the cartridge runs out on toner on their modern laser-jet printers it just fails to print. Every other laser-jet printer I have ever seen continues printing until the cartridge is obviously low on toner- you can see on the actual print has streaks or it becomes transparent or too light because of a lack of toner. This didn't happen on the HL-2140, the printer just stops and the toner light comes on. I believe that Brother actually kills the use of the printer after a period so you have to go out and buy a new toner cartridge instead of allowing you to actually use it until the cartridge actually runs out of toner. Another corporation using gimmicks to require you to pay them more. The tech informed me that their cartridges are filled according to an ISO standard for low volume cartridges. This should be enough to last several hundred prints, not less than 100. I bought a laser-jet printer to avoid having to replace the cartridge so fast....Big disappointment! I had to go out and replace the toner cartridge at about the same number of prints I would have made if it were an ink jet printer cartridge...;;1.0;;July 2, 2010;;5;;6;;0.833333

From start up to printing the "quick start" guide was clear and concise with a step by step approach that did not leave this novice confused.  Frankly, what has kept me from printing photos in the past has been a fear of technical language beyond my vocabulary.  But the instructions given here left nothing to chance or misunderstanding.  Loading the ink, the paper, connecting to my MacBook Pro and printing the first photos was easy and did not take a lot of time.  From box to print took about 45 minutes and that was after checking everything twice.<br />So far, color family photos, a couple of scenics and several black and white photos have gone through the machine with fantastic results.  The color on the print very well matches what I see on the screen.  And black and white photos come out even better.  They are fantastic.  After showing my wife the same photo in color and black and white, she preferred the black and white, but it was a hard choice for her to make.<br />I am only beginning to explore the capabilities of this printer and I know that in the hands of someone more experienced this machine would put out awesome photographs.  I would highly recommend the Epson Stylus R2880 to anyone who wishes to have more control over their printing.  Its ease of use and quality photos will spoil even the most critical user.;;5.0;;January 17, 2009;;8;;8;;1.0

This printer is perfect - I can see the smallest fonts clearly even on regular paper (I usually use matte photo paper for my work).  The print is amazingly sharp and clear.  I just upgraded from a Pixma ip6000 which was wonderful as well.  I'm very pleased with the color, detail, and crispness of the prints.  It was super easy to set up on our wifi network at home.  My only complaint is that I frequently run into "communication errors" between the printer and our basement router.  The printer isn't really that far away from the router  but I find myself re-entering the wifi password more times than I'd like.  I'm not sure if it is a matter of distance, in which case I'll have to put the printer ON my living room sofa right ABOVE the router and serve it drinks too when company comes.  It usually glitches at 7am in the morning right before the bus comes when the kids realize they haven't printed out last nights homework.<br /><br />So...when the printer and the router are on speaking terms the printer works like a charm and I'm more than satisfied with the print.<br /><br />Ink issues...I haven't had a problem.  I've had the printer about a month now and the kids have printed out some pretty heavily colored projects and we're only just now noticing that one of the tanks is getting low.

My other option was to take it to a local HP repair center which I did.

I then went to set up the "web ePrint" service which is a cool feature where your printer has its own email address (hosted on HP's servers) and if you want to print something on the printer from anywhere, you just send it to that email address and it prints.<br />This is a "nice to have" for me but I figured it might come in handy.<br /><br />It's a bit tricky to set up - the original setup of the printer printed out a page with a "printer code" needed to register but I forgot about it for a couple of days, and when I went back to activate that printer code on HP's web site, it had expired.  The HP web site directions on how to get a new code from the printer were wrong - they mention menus on the printer that don't exist, but this is apparently because HP keeps coming out with new models of this printer and changing the printer software menus. I eventually found a menu on the printer control pad that kind of / sort of sounded like what the web site was talking about and was able to reactivate my printer code to register on the eprintcenter.com site for email access.<br /><br />But it doesn't work.<br /><br />The problem of course is SPAM.  If anyone gets that email address, they can use it to print all kinds of crap (remember Junk Faxes?) on your printer.  So it appears that HP has the receiving email server set up pretty securely and the side-effect is - it rejects emails sent to it, even if legitimate.  I've spent about 30 minutes playing with this and found this thread on the HP site [...] with complaints from many with the same problem.<br /><br />If the email feature is important to you, I'd encourage you to research that before buying the printer.  It is pretty finicky and a lot of people are having trouble with it.<br /><br />Otherwise, the only complaint so far is the usual one - HP provides cartridges with just about a teaspoon of ink and a set of new cartridges cost about 1/2 the cost of the printer.<br /><br />== Experience 6 months later == (Update 6/28/2012)<br /><br />Wow, HP used to make such great printers.  My OfficeJet 6100 is still running after several years and with very few problems.  I would not recommend this printer. It's finnicky - the WiFi comes and goes and requires a periodic hard reset (pulling the power cable is all that seems to work) about every 2 weeks.  HP bundles TONS of crapware with their so-called "driver" install.  And even simple things like "out of paper" don't work quite right.<br /><br />Too bad that HP, which used to really OWN the printer market, has so muffed it.;;3.0;;December 12, 2011;;6;;6;;1.0

I was replacing a Dell P720 so just looking for a basic printer that would look nice in the desk area by eliminating cords. Well, the price was nice and shipment from Amazon good. The machine comes with TONS of print cartridges and was easy to put together. The main negative for me was there is a horribly placed "duplexer" in back that you MUST have plugged in at all times or print jobs will fail. This thing sticks out about 5 inches from the back of the printer, so you will never be able to place this machine flush against a wall. For me this was bad as it just doesn't look as nice as one that would sit in a corner flush to a wall.<br /><br />Secondly, the wireless. Good and bad news. Bad news = I spent about 90 minutes trying to get the stupid HP software to set up my wireless for me but it kept failing with indecipherable errors. I was about to give up and return it when I decided to delete the HP set up and just set it up through Windows default printer set-up. Doing it this way, the wireless works perfectly. Thinking I fixed it, I tried the HP software again, and it still was failing and would break the wireless. SO, I gave up on the HP software and just did it through Windows and have left it alone and it works just fine. Bottom line, don't bother with the HP software and do it through Windows if you are doing wireless.<br /><br />Printing is much quieter than my old printer, quality is good, and it looks nice. However, I wouldn't buy it given a second chance due to the inability to sit flush on a wall and the goofy HP software.<br /><br />One other tip, through the end of the year, HP is doing a "Trade up and Save" rebate where you can get $50 back on this printer just by mailing back your old printer (doesn't even have to be working AND they give you a pre-paid label).;;3.0;;November 21, 2009;;20;;20;;1.0

I couldn't wait to get started! BTW: A little surprised that a USB came with my inexpensive scanner (purchased same day) but one did NOT come with my expensive printer.<br /><br />I loaded a piece of the (not cheap, mind you) Epson Velvet fine art paper. Unfortunately, when printing with this paper, you must have your paper settings on "roll" and  use the single sheet feeder on back. If you don't, the printer will NOT let you select fine art paper by using the regular feed tray. (Which I found later/after a few tries to be a big annoyance.)<br /><br />My first print came out marvelously. The print speed wasn't too slow and the color was exceptionally rich and bright compared to my old Epson RX that was replaced by this new 2880. I was pretty happy with the investment at that point.<br /><br />I loaded my second piece of velvet fine art paper (which, with the back single-sheet feed tray, you must guide the paper down by hand until the printer grabs it and pulls it in further) and when I hit "print" I got an error saying there was a paper jam.<br /><br />WELL.. it is now three days later and I STILL am getting "paper jam" error messages despite continuously ejecting and/or removing the paper by hand and carefully reloading it. I haven't been able to print anything since.<br /><br />It does not seem to matter what I do (different piece of paper, rotate paper, blow on rollers to clear possible dust, turn printer off and on again, Epson manual, Epson support, etc etc) this printer WILL NOT load the paper without giving me an error.<br /><br />I can't sit here and mess with a fussy printer all night trying to get one print out of it. I did not spend EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS on a printer that won't print on art paper let alone load it properly.<br /><br />Epson got it all wrong with this machine. Way too many technical difficulties (not just the paper jamming but the way it is set up/paper profiles/charging ink on and on). I don't think I'll ever know what this printer is fully capable of because it simply WILL NOT WORK.<br /><br />***UPDATE: 4.2010***<br />I went back to the store I purchased my printer from and complained about the jamming. I've made the mistake of calling Espon support before. Not only is there a language barrier problem, they keep you on the phone for HOURS and offer no results or solutions. Anyway-- the store I got this printer from called me back three days later and offered to exchange it in house. I felt better about that; knowing for sure I wouldn't get a re-furbished one and that my printer was shipped by Epson on a palette rather than with some UPS schmo who chucked it around. Brought the new one home, plugged it in.. it charged the ink a bunch and wasted some.. printed one print magnificently, and then what do you know: PAPER JAM. I am SOOOOOO incredibly sick of this thing telling me there is a paper jam.<br /><br />{{{{{{{{ This printer has three loading options. ONE: normal tray for normal paper. Use it, and you CAN NOT select fine art or thick paper profiles. It grays them out and simply won't let you pick them. If you try to print from here your thick art paper gets nicked by the print head and you get black lines on the edges of your sheet. TWO: Thick or rear feed. Using this will let you select art paper profiles, but this is the one that keeps jamming. This one you have to use a "roll" setting with. It doesn't matter how long I sit here and fuss with it or what I do (see everything I tried above), this printer WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT send another piece of thick/art paper through. JAM/miss-feed/jam jam jam. THREE: front loading. This is where you can send 13x19 inch/thick paper, but I've read in forums that others are experiencing jamming here, too. I was told by employees at the store I got this to try the front-load option with my thick art paper (keep in mind I'm using Epson paper, not some super thick or strange paper), but when I loaded it and tried to print an 8x10 on 8.5x11 inch paper I got an error message. Something to the effect of: 'wrong paper type/wrong size/not loaded correctly'; the printer made me take out the paper and reset everthing before the error would go away and I never got a print from the front loading tray.  }}}}}}}}<br /><br />It seems to me that NONE of the three loading options will work with nice Epson art paper, which is what this printer was meant for. Perfect.<br /><br />SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE AND DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER. I have no idea how some people can give it rave reviews and not have any problems; they must be the few lucky ones that received a printer that actually functioned. I'm doing nothing out of the ordinary and even asked others to load the paper for me so I knew I wasn't doing something wrong. This is infuriating.

Some reviewers did not all give this an overall high rating, mainly because at the time of the reviews it was priced at 40% above the HP and Canon similar inkjet options at 400 dollars plus. However, in side by side comparisons this printer was generally rated better for most features, it was just thought by the reviewers to be too expensive. However, at it's current price which has dramatically dropped, possibly as a result of reviewers who did not rank this printer well due to its price,  it is a great value. It has a low print cost, excellent copy and scan functions and a great fax. photo copies look great and the text quality is very sharp and clear. Text while very good isn't as deep black as I would like, but it is good and near laser quality. If you just need black and white text, I would however suggest looking at a laser or hp or cannon, as the blackness of their ink/text is a bit more appealing to my eye. This machine is extremely fast, and not too loud. The quality of the fax, scanner and sheet feeder is probably better than the competition at this price point and the software seems to be solid so far, unlike some of the competition. At the time of this review this a great value. It can be found at walmart cheaper with free delivery at the time of this review.;;4.0;;June 21, 2012;;7;;7;;1.0

The Pogo's bluetooth printing works fine (although I wish it would beep or give some other indication that it has started receiving data) -- after about 20 seconds, the actual printing begins.  The few prints I have made so far have had ehcolor balance and banding issues -- if color quality is important, this is not the right device.  However, for on-the-go fun, this little gadget works fine.<br /><br />The 2"x3" paper is a bit on the small side, and the adhesive backing is only moderately sticky.

Let's hope that my review helps you out.<br /><br />Usually, I buy the top of the line everything. But this time, since I dont print 1000 documents a day, or 100 pictures a day, I deemed it unnecessary to spend hundreds. First of all, I dont think that I would consider this to be a "compact" printer. It definitely takes up some room. However, everything that is needed is in the box. The set-up was pretty much idiot proof, and the installation software worked flawlessly for me. I was up and running in less than 30 minutes.<br /><br />The printer itself is somewhat noisy, but it does print clear, crisp lines. I dont like that page 1 ends up on the bottom of the stack when printing multiple pages though. It is just a minor annoyance to manually put the pages in order.<br /><br />The scanner function worked perfectly, and I had to scan about 20 pages today. It is quick, and is easy for transferring over to your computer.<br /><br />I have only used the photo printer once or twice, and for a printer of this economical value, you cant beat the quality of pictures. They dont have the appearance of the typical cheap printer. But, remember that photo paper quality does play a role in the clarity.<br /><br />Overall, you cant beat this printer for the price. I would have easily paid over $100 and still been completely satisfied. If you are looking for small, compact, and quiet, this isnt the printer for you. If you are looking for inexpensive, great features, ease of use, and multiple functions, look no further.<br /><br />UPDATE: As of today, 1/19/2011, I have used the photo printer more frequently to copy 4"x6" pictures, first scanning and then printing them, and it is almost hard to tell the original from the copy. Very impressed!!! Such a great buy, and if it lasts longer than a year or two, I will have definitely gotten my money's worth.;;4.0;;December 29, 2010;;14;;14;;1.0
R3PM5VH2RVJ2TK;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A36Z1KJU547QB7;;Printer;;B004QM99JG;;Brother Printer MFC7860DW Wireless Monochrome Printer with Scanner, Copier & Fax;;Very nice, but has a few small quirks;;I just bought one of these a couple of days ago.  I had been thinking of getting one for some time, but wanted to wait for a really good price to come around and it finally did.  I specifically wanted to get this model because (a) is has Postscript emulation (which I want, just because it gives me a comfort factor... I _know_ that I'll always be able to print from my UNIX systems as long as I have that) and because (b) it fit my budget.  Basically, this is just about the least expensive all-in-one that you can get that includes Postscript emulation.  But that doesn't mean that it is short on features.  Far from it!<br /><br />This is about twice as fast (printing) as the crusty but reliable old HP LaserJet 3015 that it is replacing.<br /><br />Mostly, I wanted to replace my old HP 3015 because it had a rather annoying habit of refusing to grab sheets properly from the ADF.  It would often grab two or three sheets instead of one, or grab nothing at all.  Sigh.  This made faxing or copying kind of a pain at times.<br /><br />So far the MFC-7860DW is not having any such problem.  I managed to get it working with _both_ my FreeBSD UNIX system _and_ with my Windoze 2000 system with no problems at all.  It is now on my local network, hanging off on my reliable Linksys WTR54g router, and when printing from Win 2000 the data goes via the (hardwired) ethernet connection, but from the UNIX system, I am using a straight USB connection.  (It does appear that both can be used ``simultaneously'' however I haven't tried anything devious like trying to send print jobs to the thing via both connection types at the exact same time.)<br /><br />Initial setup of the thing seemed absolutely trivial to me, but then I _am_ a professional geek and I know my way around networking.  The only thing you really need to keep in mind is that the thing wants to do a DHCP handshake with your router, you know, in order to pull an IP address for itself.  The manual wasn't entirely clear about this, but if you have already powered the thing on and THEN you wire up the ethernet port... well... you will then need to power cycle the 7860dw in order to get it to reboot, whereupon it will do the DHCP dance and get itself an IP address and then you will be up and running.<br /><br />As regards to using it with UNIX systems, well, it seems that you can just push files (plain text or Postscript) out to the thing just by connecting to its (TCP) port 9100 and then just sending the data across.  (You can do that using `nc' aka `netcat'.)  No fancy wrappers, encapsulation, or extra protocol needed at all.  Alternatively, as I learned while playing around with it, the thing also has a built-in FTP server and you can also just FTP a file to it and a couple of seconds later that file will be automagically printed.  (Again this works for both plain text and Postscript.)  Nice and simple.  That's exactly the way I like things.  (It also apparently speaks the LPD protocol and the IPP protocol... on other ports of course.  It seems like Brother covered all of the bases as regards to different ways you can talk to this thing.  In short, they apparently didn't skimp when it came to the firmware, and the features thereof.)<br /><br />Other than the need to reboot (power cycle) in order to initiate DHCP, the only other things that were even mildly surprising about this thing were:<br /><br />1)  When it starts up from ``deep sleep'' mode, it must apparently need a LOT of power for a brief half second or so.  Anyway, it actually makes the lights dim in the room the printer is in when it starts up from deep sleep, but only for a fraction of a second. (It doesn't trip any circuit breakers though, so I'm not, like, worried about it or anything.  It's just a little spooky.)<br /><br />2)  As other people have claimed, it is rather noisy.  I haven't yet used the duplexer (so I don't know about that), but as regards to when it is actually DOING STUFF... printing or scanning or whatever... it actually DOES NOT seem particularly noisy to me.  HOWEVER I am just slightly annoyed that it has a built-in fan (my old HP didn't' have one) AND that little sucker makes noise... not a lot, but some... even when the bleepin' machine isn't doing anything at all.  THAT is what is annoying... not the ``working'' noise, but the ``just sitting there but not yet in deep sleep mode'' noise.  Fortunately, there is a configuration setting where you can tell thing thing to run that fan for only 1 minute (rather than the default 3 minutes) during inactivity and then turn it off and go to ``deep sleep'' mode.  That's good enough for me, but if they gave me an option to make that 0 (zero) minutes, I would use that.  I don't really see the point in running the fan when the machine isn't even doing anything.<br /><br />3)  Lastly, when I first tried testing out the FAX sending feature I was intermittently getting some unexpected prompt (on the LED display) after I pressed "start".  It said like "1. Next page 2. Send(FAX)" or something like that, and the thing would make noise like it was getting ready to do something, but then ultimately it would just quiet down and then just sit there at that prompt, never having even tried to pull any of the pages off of the ADF to scan them.  This was totally puzzling to me, so I called Brother Tech Support.<br /><br />Let me stop right here and say that Brother tech support is another big reason I bought this unit.  I had owned a different (and much earlier) Brother FAX machine, way back around 2001, and I remembered their tech support being very good at the time, i.e. their help with the one and only issue I ever had with THAT machine.  (It turned out that I just needed to wipe down some internal part that had collected some dust that was spoiling the printouts.)<br /><br />Fortunately, over the past decade it seems they have kept their good tech support.  I called and got through pretty darn quick (after the normal phone menu navigation)  to someone who (a) spoke good and clear English and who also (b) seemed ready, willing, and able to help me.  Fuggetabout the hardware!  Brother gets SIX stars out of five for tech support, at least in my book.  (Most people don't think about the quality of a manufacturer's tech support until its too late, i.e. when they need it and it's not really there for them.  Brother was there for me... in 2001 _and_ again in 2012.)<br /><br />Anyway, the bottom line is that after a few minutes and the tech support person telling me that the prompt indicated that the machine thought that I might be trying to FAX something direct from the flatbed (i.e. NOT using the ADF) the light finally turned on over my head.  Haha!  Operator error!  My bad! I just needed to push my originals down into the bowels of the ADF a tiny bit more forcefully.  As soon as I did that, I had no problems at all.<br /><br />So, the bottom line is that this one is a keeper, and gets five stars from me.;;5.0;;February 22, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

Sure, maybe someday when I have a real job and a real car and a real wife and I'm living the American dream, but those are theoretical points in the future that the college industrial complex has constructed for me to justify my sinking into debt and working a full time job while taking a double load of classes.

Great color, and very crisp printouts, nearly laser quality output (it's actually an LED printer, which uses a less-costly print technology than laser, but has the same basic laser-type toner cartridges).  Even from an inch away the fonts look very crisp.<br /><br />Toner cartridges are about $60 each.  The starter cartridges are supposed to last 1000 pages but I've only had it a month so we'll see how that goes.  You get (essentially) laser quality output but for $350, color, USB, Ethernet and wireless interfaces built in - so it's hard to beat.  No problems at all to date, but as I say it's still new.<br /><br />Colors are very good, but if you're looking to print photos it's not going to look as good as a photo printer.  Great for color images and charts/graphs in documents, though, and better color quality than my $99 Epson ink jet (non photo printer).<br /><br />Setup on the USB and plug-in Ethernet network connection is quite easy, there's a built in web interface in the printer that you login to.  Had to download a driver from the Brother website but that was easy to do.

The printer is easy to operate, and colors are nothing short of amazing...fine, detailed prints like nothing I've ever been able to produce.<br /><br />Drawbacks are probably what others mention...the matte black/photo black swapping thing is just silly, the ink cartridges are too small, at highest quality settings the printer's a bit slow, no built-in network interface, and the printer's physically a little on the large size.<br /><br />Still, for me it's all about the final image quality - and nothing I've seen tops the Epson in this regard.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Okay, so I've been living with my R2880 for about sixteen months now, and I wanted to refute some of the claims other reviewers have made. Perhaps I'm just one of the lucky ones, but my experience with the R2880 has been nothing short of fantastic.<br /><br />I've printed well over 2000 prints and gone through dozens of ink cartridges by now, and I'm happy to say that I haven't experienced EVEN A SINGLE JAM, MIS-FEED or other operational problem. I tend to use Epson's Ultra-Premium Luster for 8x10 size prints, Epson Velvet or Exhibition Fiber in 13x19 - and a few non-Epson brands including Museo, Ilford Silk and a few others. I've done a bit with canvas (both sheets and roll), though that's relatively rare for me. The short story is that everything I've tried has worked properly. Overall, I couldn't be happier with my printer.<br /><br />I do use my printer fairly regularly - always at least once or twice a week, usually more. As of now, except for the cycle when I install a new ink cartridge or initially power it on, I've never seen it waste ink on a cleaning cycle, nor have I ever had to manually trigger cleaning. My volume is high enough that I deal with the ink-swapping sillyness by simply waiting until I have enough material that I can use an entire print cartridge (about 50 prints, generally). I make the switch, print till I run out of matte ink, and then I switch back. This works for me, and doesn't waste any ink.<br /><br />My initial comment regarding the ink cartridges being too small is probably my number one gripe. Because the various color inks are used at different rates according to the tones in your photographs, it's not like you stop every so often and replace all the ink. You print, replace one color, print some more, replace the next one, and so on. I just find this slows me down unacceptably, and I'd like the option to have maybe 3-5 times more ink per cartridge.<br /><br />Print quality continues to be amazing...the only other printer I've seen that beats it is Epson's newer 7900 - a much larger printer that costs five times what the R2880 sells for. Yes, I'm a perfectionist with top quality gear, all the best software, calibration equipment, and I spend a lot of time fine tuning everything to get the best possible image quality. But I feel I've been rewarded for this work, and everyone who sees my prints comments as to the quality.;;5.0;;August 8, 2008;;106;;110;;0.963636

It was easy to set up and is easy to use.  I took a look at "Real World Color Management," by Fraser, Murphy, and Bunting, before I started using the printer.  It's a helpful book, even if you just skim a few of the early chapters.  It helped me to understand the printer's advanced options and to get the results I wanted.  You could just use the printer with the out of the box settings, and I suppose it would produce really nice results.  I'm an artist, though, and I want to be in control.  That's why I bought this printer, I was frustrated with unpredictable results from labs.<br /><br />A note on ink:<br /><br />I have been printing on glossy paper.  At $18.99 per cartridge for ink (Epson website price, with free overnight shipping if you order at least three cartridges at a time), so far,<br /><br />- my 8.5" x 11" prints are roughly $1.20 - $1.80 for ink<br /><br />- my 13" x 19" are about $3.50 - $5.50 for ink<br /><br />(Printing in "Photo" mode puts your costs at the low end of the ranges.  Printing in "Photo RPM" mode costs about 40% - 50% more and puts you at the high end of the price ranges.  I usually cannot distinguish between "Photo" and "Photo RPM" modes, so I almost always print in "Photo" mode.  Occasionally, I notice banding or tones which do not appear smooth on very close inspection, then I switch to "Photo RPM.")<br /><br />Warning: I believe ink use varies considerably with paper type. less ink for glossy, more ink for semi-gloss, and still more ink for matte and art paper.  I'm not sure though.<br /><br />I am printing on Inkpress Glossy paper (equivalent in weight, sheen, and brightness to Epson Premium Glossy Photo Paper) which I ordered from B&H Photo.  It's less expensive than Epson paper and looks spectacular.<br /><br />In fact, I recently gave two 8x10's to a friend as a gift.  She thought they looked wonderful and was astonished to learn that they were inkjet prints.  She thought they must have been "professionally" printed at a lab.  I was pretty flattered (credit to the printer, too, of course...)  She also happens to be an artist and professional web designer, so she's got a fine eye.<br /><br />---------------<br />Update:<br /><br />I've used the printer some more.  I'm still very pleased.  However, I've looked closer at the Inkpress paper I mentioned above.  From a distance, it looks great, but closer up, it has many problems.  Almost every sheet is covered with fine scratches, and about half the sheets have at least one major defect (some as large as 1/8" in diameter) where the gloss coating did not cover the paper.  The defects are like little potholes on the surface.  At first, I thought I had caused these problems through poor handling.  Epson Premium Photo Paper Glossy has an absolutely flawless surface, though, and I have handled the prints the same way.  I don't recommend the Inkpress paper.;;5.0;;February 19, 2008;;297;;305;;0.97377

Within a week, the printer wanted to get updates, so I let it.  It was stuck in an update loop for over a week.  After 2 phone calls to HP, they threw up their hands and sent me a replacement.  Can't tell if replacement is new or refurb.  But there are a lot of people in the hp support forums with the same problem.  No resolution from HP, no indication they have stopped the updates from going out, and no fix yet.  This is a buggy printer with zero support from HP.  A one-star rating is too high.  There needs to be a negative rating on this site.  I would give the printer -2 stars (I guess that means I'd take 2 stars from them?).  I still like the printer for what I need it for, just hope it doesn't go bad soon.

The unit was a prodigious consumer of toner, as are perhaps all color laser printers.  Printers in this price range are primarily vehicles for selling toner.<br /><br />The error indication on my CLP-315W was:  "System error.  Power cycle."  The User Manual suggested contacting Samsung for service.<br /><br />My first impulse was to repair the ailing CLP-315W, as it had given yeoman service.  Bad call.<br /><br />The Samsung web site led me through several steps for recording and reporting the problem.  When I was ready to submit these materials, I was informed that online submission was not possible for my unit (because it was out of warranty?).<br /><br />I used Samsung's Chat service to determine my next step.  Eventually, the Chat person recommended that I submit my problem online (as I had just attempted to do).  I gave up on Chat.<br /><br />I called Samsung's toll-free number and described my problem.  I asked for the location of the nearest Samsung service center.<br /><br />Silly question.  There is only one authorized service center.  A 3rd party repair facility called Koambra, located in California.  I live in Florida.<br /><br />Before calling Koambra, I checked online to see what the cost would be for a new imaging unit:  $150 + shipping.  For a new fuser:  $90 + shipping.<br /><br />I didn't bother calling Koambra.<br /><br />Fortunately, Office Depot was offering an online special on the CLP-325W. $99 plus tax, free shipping.  I also purchased a 2-year product replacement guarantee for $14 (product shipping costs included).<br /><br />The manufacturer's warranty is for 1-year, but I can only imagine the horrors of dealing with Samsung for warranty service.<br /><br />If my CLP-325W crumps out within the next 2 years, I am hoping to send it back/take it into my local Office Depot and pick up a new printer.  I prefer not to test this hypothesis, but it sounds good.<br /><br />One way or another, if my new CLP-325W holds together for a full two years, I will have had quality color laser output for about $60/year, plus the cost of toner.  Works for me.<br /><br />Although the form factor for the 315W and 325W appears to be the same, Samsung has cleverly changed the specifications on the toner cartridges, making it impossible to re-use the toner cartridges from my old 315W.  I have, however, salvaged the toner waste container and paper tray, both of which seem identical to those on the 325W.  These salvaged items will probably lie unused in my closet for the next 50 years or so.<br /><br />Given that my local Office Depot occasionally offers $5 for each recycled toner cartridge, my upgrade costs will be pretty modest once I turn in the four cartridges from my old 315W.<br /><br />Set your expectations for quality printing, useless technical support, and disposable printers.  And you'll be fine.;;3.0;;December 18, 2011;;7;;9;;0.777778

I lucked out and bought the unit when it was on sale at $329!  Actully, Brother, HP and other manufacturers should give these machines away for free because the cost of replacing the toners and drums will far exceed by several multiples the purchase price of the machine over the life of the machine.<br /><br />It was very easy to set up the machine and "pair" it to my wireless network --  you do need a USB cable to "pair" the machine to your computer and the network; the pairing took less than a minute.<br /><br />I've always had HP machines; oh, how I miss my HP color AIO that died after seven (7) years of use.  The specs of this Brother is better than my departed HP but the color on the HP seemed better (but the unit cost nearly $800 back then). I'll have to play with the color setting and use color laser paper going forward.<br /><br />Printing from my iPhone 4 was a breeze and the photos I printed came out pretty good.<br /><br />I'm amazed at being able to print from my laptop wirelessly.  I have Vonage so I have to keep the machine close to the Vonage adepter for faxing.  My home office is actually upstairs and the printer is hidden next to couch in the living room downstairs. I'm going to use my HP LaserJet P1006 for everyday black and white printing.<br /><br />The HP printers no longer look good; they look bulky and plain ugly.  This Brother machine looks attractive and elegant -- like the new BMW 3 series :-)<br /><br />It looks like the price for this Brother went back up close to the MSRP.  Even at that price, this machine is worth it.<br /><br />Setting the time/date on the machine (for faxing) is not as easy as my departed HP AIO. I have to read the user's guide to figure that out.<br /><br />I hope the scanner works well and easily -- that's next on my to do list: learn to use that function.<br /><br />Update February 29, 2012<br /><br />I ordered 512 MB of additional memory from 1 Arch Computer through Amazon; I should get it in a few days.  I wish the machine came with more than  64 MB of memory.<br /><br />The user's guides do not do an adequate job of explaining how to use the scannner; I may have to call Brother customer service for this (as I had to for my departed AIO HP).  I couldn't find an option to turn scanned documents into PDF docs that would go straight to my laptop.<br /><br />Maybe it's Vonage but I could not fax a 20 page document; I got an insufficient memory error message even though I used the "color copy" to send the fax.<br /><br />I'm hoping the additional 512 MB of memory will solve my faxing problem.<br /><br />On the plus side, the color photos I printed came out very nice.<br /><br />Update March 10, 2012<br /><br />The fax works very nicely even on Vonage.  The extra RAM I added helps a lot.  The machine scans the documents into memory and then sends the entire document -- very fast.  Great for large document faxing.<br /><br />As for printing photos, the quality of the print depends on the camera that was used to take the photo.  Photos that were taken with high quality digital cameras come out very nice; while photos taken with my iPhone 4 come out a shade dark and not as crisp.<br /><br />Next task to master -- learning to use the scanner.<br /><br />I love it that I can print wirelessly from my laptop, iPhone and iPad 2 -- this novelty has not worn off yet.<br /><br />Update: June 2012<br /><br />I'm happy with the fax, print and copy functions.  I'm still trying to figure out how to get the scan function to scan in PDF mode; I followed the MFG's instructions and set it to PDF but it still scans in JPG mode and the PDF image/file shows up as blank files.;;5.0;;February 24, 2012;;55;;61;;0.901639

It hasn't jammed once when working from the paper tray.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the manual form feed slot is frustrating. It's a tiny slit, not a tray that holds and support inserted media, and the slit doesn't lead smoothly into the printer feed. As a result, I have to try placing feed-in paper with precision, finding just the right position for it to be accepted. It seems the printer could have had a smoother intake window for manual forms. When the printer isn't warmed up, my insertion of manually-fed media seems to baffle the printer and it goes into it's "red light" error mode, as if the printer is going, "What, what?? Who, me?

I have to remove the paper, click the printer off and on, and resume the effort with a "warmed up" device instead.<br /><br />ADDENDUM: I've been having problems documents failing to print.

I am extremely pleased with how easy it is to scan, copy, and print for standard home use, with excellent quality plain paper prints made - especially for the price. The photos that we've printed have been slightly off in color, so we'll only print for casual use, and print our "artsy" photos at a lab.<br /><br />SAVING INK:<br />1. This printer has a pigment black tank, which is separate from the smaller black tank that is used with the three yellow/cyan/magenta tank to create color printouts/pictures.  Note that the default for this printer is for it to stay on until turned off (both done manually).  You can change the setting to have the printer shut off after a certain period of time, but DON'T do that - reason is that every time the printer is turned on, it cleans the print heads, which wastes a bit of every ink color every time.  Turn that baby on and off several times a day for different users, and you waste ink fast. (Note that the door to eject copies opens automatically with the first print job, and that it will reopen again if you close it gently between print jobs in order to conserve space or keep the dust out.)<br /><br />2. Check out the following article on Canon's website.  You'll learn how to use the pigment black ink only (cheaper) for b & w printing, by adjusting defaults.  Be sure to bookmark or print this out so you don't waste most of the first color tanks of ink like I did by printing duplex in grayscale (and shutting down and starting up the printer several times a day)!<br /><br />On the Canon USA website, get to the product page for the MG 5320 (multi-function, Pixma series).  Choose "support".  A window will open beneath that.  Type in "Print using black ink only".  You will see instructions for adjusting settings for both Windows and Mac OS.;;4.0;;May 15, 2012;;36;;36;;1.0

(See end of this review.);;I'm typing this review after my MP560 has decided that today it doesn't want to make photocopies. No reason given, it just doesn't want to do it. I'm beginning to think the "MP" in MP560 stands for "Might Print." (If so, I'd suggest to Canon that "MPMN" would be more accurate: Might Print, Might Not.) Some days it hops right to it. Other days it takes up to three minutes of enigmatic clunking and whirring before it deigns to copy one page. And today, as it sometimes does, it decides that it just doesn't want to be a printer. Pushing the "start" button on my MP560 is similar to pulling a lever on a slot machine: I never know what's going to happen. I suppose the upside of this is that I'll never waste money on a trip to Vegas, because my printer gives me all the gambling excitement I'll ever want.<br /><br />If you want an ontologically tormented printer that can't decide what it wants to be, then this is the printer for you. Me, I'd like a printer that happily embraces its function and performs it without throwing geeky temper tantrums.<br /><br />On top of this, the MP560 suffers from needlessly bloated software, performing inscrutable functions that are annoyingly non-intuitive. One example: scanning a document is needlessly complex, and the MP560 saves every scan in a very slow program where I've yet to figure out how to delete scans I no longer want. I'm sure it's possible to delete them. All I need to do is wade through the Russian novel of an owner's manual to find out how. To me, this is an example of software geeks gone wild, cramming arcane functions into what should be a simple product. Note to software designers: most people don't want to devote a significant portion of their lives to figuring out how to work a printer. We want to print, copy, and scan with a minimum of fuss.<br /><br />This printer's deficiencies even extend to minor details. For example, the blank paper holding tray slides neatly into the base of the printer. Is the front of the tray transparent, so you can see how much paper is left? Of course not. It's black opaque plastic, so the only way to know if there's any paper in the holding tray is to slide it out and look. One would think that making a transparent tray would be obvious to any competent design team. But it wasn't obvious to the MP560's designers.<br /><br />  --January 14, 2011 Update--<br /><br />Today my MP560 is refusing to scan a document until I replace an empty cyan ink tank. Mind you, I'm not trying to print anything. I just want to scan a document. Really? Canon, are you still running this old scam, forcing customers to buy an ink cartridge even when they're doing something that has nothing to do with printing? Unbelievable. If anyone wants a free Canon MP560, they can find mine at the curb in front of my home on the next trash pickup day. Although I've had this printer only one year, I want this piece of junk out of my life.<br /><br />  --Another Update--<br /><br />Wait, this gets better. After writing the above, I decided to give this printer one more chance. I bought the cyan ink cartridge that the printer said was empty. Installed the cartridge, and then tried to make a black and white copy for a student during a lesson. First my student and I waited a full three minutes while MP560 deliberated mysteriously. Then it announced that the magenta cartridge was empty. It hadn't said anything about this when it told me the cyan cartridge was empty. And of course it refused to make a black and white copy.<br /><br />  --And Yet Another Update--<br /><br />By this time, I have a perverse curiousity in just how bad this printer can be. So I bought the magenta cartridge and installed it. Then I tried to make a scan. Temporaily satisfied that it has no more empty cartridges, my MP560 is now refusing to scan a document. I push all the correct buttons (the same ones I've done in the past), the printer displays "processing" on its video display, then it tells me to press the "Color" button, which I already did. So I press it again. Again I get the "processing" display, then it again tells me to press the "Color button." And if I do it again? Same result. Will MP 560 do a scan for me? Not today. Apparently it now prefers to see how many times I'll push the same button hoping for a different result.<br /><br />Dear Canon: I say this with deepest sincerity. You've managed to design and build a printer that's guaranteed to drive its owner crazy. Indeed, I'm in awe of what you've accomplished with the MP560. Really. I consider myself a reasonably patient man. But your product has driven me to seriously consider smashing it with a sledgehammer. If this was your design team's intent, then congratulations on a job well done.<br /><br />  --Workaround to keep printing when a color cartridge is empty--<br /><br />Hold the "Color" and "Stop" buttons down simultaneously until the orange light goes out. Then you might be able to make a black & white print or do a scan. (Of course, if the black ink cartridge is empty, you won't be able to print a black & white page.) My thanks to "Staci," whoever she is, who described this workaround in a comment on another MP560 product review.;;1.0;;November 2, 2010;;41;;43;;0.953488

The MFC-8480 only provides duplex on printing.<br /><br />I have Macs--several of them--so I've been looking around for a while for a multi-function laser machine I could use for printing, scanning, copying, and the occasional fax.  I'm thoroughly impressed with this machine so far, and following the install from CD, everything just plain worked.  The printer driver was installed, it included a fax option right in the driver itself (on one of the print option tabs), and so was the TWAIN driver for scanning, and so was their ControlCenter software, which provides access to all the settings for the printer, documentation, and a bunch of customizable presets for the different functions of the printer (most useful for scanning different kinds of documents to different apps on the Mac, including an OCR capability).<br /><br />The duplex is great--the auto-document feeder reads both sides of documents for copying, scanning, and even faxing.  Most less expensive models (like the 8480 and a Canon MF4370 I recently tested) will only duplex on printing, but the 8890 will both read and produce 2-sided docs for any function.<br /><br />Network capabilities for Macs is also top-notch, with both wired and wireless network capabilities, you can use every function of the machine over the network, with seemingly quick transfer rates, even high-res color scanning.  By the way, my previous favorite printer vendor, Canon, does not support network scanning to Macs on ANY of their multi-function printers, but this is not apparent until you buy one and try to do it--their support has since told me this is true.  I think the only thing the Brother 8890 doesn't do via network to a Mac is faxing--it supports some kind of Windows fax server that Apple has no equivalent of.  But since you can simply scan a document and have it sent to your Mac over the network instead, I hardly care.<br /><br />So, if you want a fully network-capable machine that works with Macs, this is your machine.  The 8480 is a bit less expensive, but does not fully support duplexing, for those with simpler office needs.;;5.0;;June 19, 2009;;196;;199;;0.984925

The problems mentioned in the previous reviews have been fixed - There is a new firmware update already on the Canon site for the scan issue.  The people complaining about the printer either had unique issues with their machine or just plain didn't read the box.  No, it doesn't come with networking, so if you are looking for that, then try one of Canon's other printers.  It has great print quality, a nice set of software tools, and is easy to use.<br /><br />One other note about the printer:  The toner cost is fairly reasonable at around $65-70 (online).  I am still using the original starter cartridge a couple of months later, so I am thinking that I will get even more life out of a full cartridge.  I was so used to toner cartridges over $100, so this was a nice surprise.;;5.0;;January 6, 2009;;13;;13;;1.0

I have had this printer for a month and so far absolutely love it.  I also considered several inkjet printers, but the duplex feature on these models worked painfully slow.  This printer can print two-sided documents very quickly and neatly.  The printer starts up very quickly from its energy-saving sleep mode.  It copies and scans well, though may be a little slow for some when it comes to scanning documents into PDF.  The included software, by the way, does allow for scanning multiple documents into a single PDF file for those using a PC (MAC users have reported that they are unable to do this).

I was also impressed by the speed.  It used to cost about $500 for a decent color laserjet, so to get one for $150 or less is great.  It is similar in size and quality to ones that we use at my work (I work in a law office).  I did have some big problems initially, so I have to subtract a star for that.  The setup was fairly easy- you basically remove all the packaging and connect the usb and power cord.  The driver install was OK, but I was disappointed that I did not get any "driver install successful message" or any prompt for a test page.  I went to print a photo and got a flashing orange "error" light.  I had to run a 2nd program which they include that told me that status of the printer was "memory full".  I kept getting a "memory full" error no matter how small the file (even a 500 kb photo).  I turned the printer off and on, checked all the cables, rebooted the PC.  Nothing worked.  So I ended up having to go to the Konica Minolta website to download a new driver. That didn't fix the problem.  So then I had to download two kinds of new firmware and that finally resolved the issue.  It killed about 2 hours of my time troubleshooting this.  I have Windows Vista 64-bit, so it's possible there were compatibility issues and perhaps other people will not have this problem.

It refuses to scan unless you first open the software that came with the printer and click on "activate scan to computer."  You have to do this every time.  And then after a few pages it stops and says there's an error, and that's the end of that.  Once in a while, the scanner does work, but most of the time it doesn't.

So I decided to give this a try, since its so cheap. I figured even if I just use up the ink that comes with it, it would be worth the 20 bucks. I am pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br />1. The size. It fits on the plastic drawers in my small apartment. Great for a college student (think dorm rooms).<br />2. The sound. Okay, this is weird...I know a lot of people are complaining about how loud it is. But I love the printing sound this little machine makes. It is loud, but soothing. Nothing like HEARING the physical action of my work being printed out. I find it thoroughly relaxing to listen to this thing.<br />3. Speed. It is pretty fast for a cheap printer like this. I printed a full page painting yesterday, and it only took about 20 seconds. My essays get printed even faster.<br />4. Design. It is a nice, simple shape. All black. Pretty sleek. Nothing sticking out. Probably would fit on to a spacy book shelf.<br />5. Over all functional printer. Worth the money. Saves me a lot of time by eliminating my trips to the office/printing store.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br /><br />1. No paper tray. I have to catch the sheets as they come out (since I have it on a chest of drawers with no extra space). So sometimes when I print multiple sheets, they get out of order. Kinda fun to see my papers flying everywhere though.<br />2. Software. Yes, it makes you install a software on your computer. That's annoying, but a one time deal. Do all printers come with softwares?<br />3. No USB cord. That's right! I had to order a USB cord separately. That's really inconsiderate of Canon.<br />4. Requires special installation if you want to print something off of a webpage, unless you copy/paste it to a Word document. YES, isn't that strange? Even websites that give you the "print" button..it still will not work just because it is on a browser. So when you install the software, make sure to set up the Online Printing option. I have to figure out how to do it over again.<br /><br />Other than that, can't complain.

I make my money fixing Windows machines. ;-)<br /><br />The printer works great. I unpacked this printer and set it up completely from the touch screen panel. I never even opened the driver cd or hooked a USB cable to it. Found my 802.11n network, entered the security key, and it connected right up. Automatically connected to HP's servers after the internet connection and checked for firmware. It printed the HP_Eprint setup page, I followed the directions on the sheet of paper for HP_Eprinting (where you can email doc's to your printer from anywhere to be printed) and I was headed to the races.<br /><br />I literally spent more time removing the packing material and shipping tape from the printer then I did setting it up for actual use.<br /><br />A reasonable computer user with knowledge on simple steps for turning on a computer, connecting to a wifi network/hotspot should be able get this printer running with ease. The elderly who barely can Skype with the grand kids or the housewife who cant navigate a DirecTv remote to also turn on the Pioneer stereo receiver may need some assistance.<br /><br />All the specific functions of the printer test ok. It prints photos on 4X6 photo paper. I only ran a few Iphone pictures through it and the quality was acceptable. Can it be better? Sure it can, but this is a $100 ink-jet printer its not a photolab $50K Minolta.<br /><br />Printing works from Iphone, Ipad, MacBook. Again print quality is acceptable for home and lite office use. This isnt a printer for magazine ready layout or desktop publishing nor have the duty cycle. It is a $100 ink-jet printer.<br /><br />Scanning works. I only scanned a few individual photos and at that only used the native HP drivers to scan to the Preview application on my MacBook. I havent tested any bundled HP scanning software that came with the printer. Remember I still havent even opened the driver CD that came with the printer. The scanned pictures were acceptable .JPG facsimile of the originals. I can not speak to the multiple scanned pictures to individual .jpg files etc. although the native HP driver does in fact have user configurable setting for such.<br /><br />Duplex printing (both sides of paper) works fine.<br /><br />I am using the branded HP 4X6 glossy photo paper for pictures, however I loaded regular 8.5X11 printer paper that I had loaded in a HP 4050N. For the people experiencing less then acceptable photo or printing results. It is in your best interest to uses HP branded paper for both jobs and I'll tell you why. In the inkjet printing arena typically there are two types of printer ink in the market. One is dye based ink and the other is pigment based ink. Most all manufactures use either one or the other, and the determining factor to getting the best performance from either of the two types of ink is the correctly matched paper composition. In the case of this particular HP photosmart printer HP uses both types of Ink. Dye based for the color and pigment based for the black ink. HP formulated these inks to best be displayed and represented on specific HP branded paper. Furthermore, you have to realize that your blacks and colors will look slightly different when printed on a 4x6 glossy photo page then the exact same image on 8.5X11 full sheet, even if the full sheet is HP branded ink jet paper. Finally this shouldn't be an issue when you accept this is still just a $100 general use household all in one inkjet printer.<br /><br />All in all its a great little printer for what it is. Its not business class, its not for professional photography printing, scanning or duty cycle. The real bread and butter of this HP printer is its wireless E-print and AirPrint abilities. You want to scan a couple photos it works. You're on the couch and find a good recipe on your Ipad you want to try. hit the print button and it works. Out in town and catch your mayor or congressmen doing blow behind a restaurant and get a picture of it on your iphone and want to get it printed before the secret service throw you into Guantanamo Bay, email the picture back home to the printer, IT WORKS.;;5.0;;January 3, 2012;;70;;76;;0.921053

I erroneously read Canon's own specs as it being supported - their site said '...XP (x64)'  If you make the same mistake I did go here:[...] - this driver worked on my XP 64bit machine.  Its ridiculous that companies like Canon don't at least supply the drivers to run on XP 64bit even if they don't support it - this usually a change of one line in the registry.  I've done it myself.  Lazy and lame.<br /><br />Setup instructions were horrible, poor layout, confusing - they called for plugging in the network setup cable into what is the USB port to set up the wireless - it's a USB cable.  Calling it a 'network setup cable' makes one think there should be a network cable and ethernet port - like other wireless printers I've set up.  As long as you understand that network setup cable means USB here you'll be ok.<br /><br />The footprint is massive and the rear paper feed makes its required space even larger, add to that you have to open the front tray for outfeed - considerably larger than the HP OfficeJet I had previously.<br /><br />Lastly - another reviewer is right in saying the fax answer options are deficient.

As a wireless printer, my laptop connects to it. It also has a USB connection and that is how my main desktop computer connects to it. I've used it for copying, faxing, scanning, and of course printing.<br /><br />It has all the characteristics of a laser printer in that it is toner-based but it does not use a laser to write onto its drum but instead uses an LED matrix. This has pluses and minuses. The plus is that it is simpler, quieter, and less expensive. The minus is that maximum resolution may not be as high as higher-end laser printers. But at 600 DPI, the resolution is still very good.<br /><br />You don't get photographic quality with this printer. If you need film-level photographic guality, send them to Walgreens and pick them up there. Or maybe get a dye-sublimation photo printer for $100. But for 99% of your home, school, or work use, the color resolution is excellent. In fact, tonight my son printed photos and drawings that were used in a school poster project on this printer and the photos were of reasonable quality.<br /><br />I've had it up to here with ink jet printers. They gurgle up ink by the gallons ($$$) and are always plugging up. My wife likes this printer because you can print on regular paper with color and it is water-proof... great for printing recipes and labels.<br /><br />When you print with this printer on regular paper, the resolution appears to be much higher than an ink jet printer, even though the ink jet's spec says it is higher. That's because the ink spot spreads or bleeds on regular paper, making it much bigger than the spot produced by this printer. Hence, text and graphics printed by this printer on regular paper has a much sharper definition than with an ink jet. In addition, when you print a photo or image on regular paper with an ink jet, the paper gets all wavy and wrinkly because, well, its getting wet! With this printer, the paper stays flat and dry.<br /><br />Although they initially cost more than an ink jet, you will save money and trouble over the long run with a printer like this:  The cost for toner is at least 1/2 the cost of ink... and the cost of your ink jet plugging up or running out of ink and you not getting your project done is unmeasurable.<br /><br />We wanted this printer to be used as a fax and it works really well in that regard. You can send a fax from the printer directly, stacking paper in the feeder, or send a fax from your computer using the fax "printer" driver. It can plug into your regular phone line and detect an incoming fax, removing your phone or answering machine out of the loop while receiving the fax.<br /><br />I've used the scanner to scan in photos and the scanner was decent. You can scan via the USB or via the wireless connection.<br /><br />I had a small space to fit the printer into and this printer has one of the smallest footprints of the printers currently on the market. I did find another printer with a smaller footprint but its construction looked cheap.<br /><br />I have a wattage meter and tested the printer for power usage and guess what: you can leave it on all the time. It automatically puts itself in a low-power mode when it is unused for a few minutes. In the low power mode, it consumes only a few watts of power, which is about the consumption of a night-light. So maybe it will cost you a quarter a month to keep it on all the time. That's nice when you print wirelessly from another room and you don't have to run in and turn on the printer. Also nice if you have it hooked up for a fax.<br /><br />I've talked to a local business and they said they prefer Brother printers because of their reliability. The machine really feels both well designed and rugged and I highly recommend it.;;5.0;;April 29, 2010;;7;;7;;1.0

So, my review can only attest to the initial quality and operation of the printer.  When shopping for a printer, I wanted a small, wireless (i.e. WiFi enabled), laser printer that I could use on my home wireless network.  This printer fits the bill.<br /><br />Once I received the printer, setup was incredibly easy.  You just hook the USB cable to your computer, follow the software prompts, and then the printer is suddenly connected to the WiFi network.  That is the last time I used the cable.  Now, when I hit print on my laptop, it prints wirelessly.<br /><br />I also like that the printer is relatively quick (24 ppm) and prints clean, crisp laser prints quickly.  For $99, this is great deal and I'm pleased with the purchase.<br /><br />I'd recommend buying this laser printer over the all-in-one units.  While those all encompassing units may be tempting, I think you end up with a better deal by buying this Samsung printer and then buying a high-quality scanner as a separate item.  For instance, I bought a separate Fujitsu Scansnap scanner (also, a very compact item).  It scans so much better than the scanner I have on the all-in-one that I bought a couple years ago.;;5.0;;February 2, 2010;;84;;85;;0.988235

I had a simple HP Deskjet, but it could not handle my needs. I began looking for a new printer. I heard a lot of good things about HP printers and was a bit of a fanboy when it came to looking. However when going through the specs of their models, I wasn't feeling too hot about any of them. I decided to broaden my view.<br /><br />Looking at all brands, I was amazed to see that more people preferred Canon with HP a close second. I looked through their line of printers and this model the PIXMA MX882 seemed to be perfect for me.<br /><br />Look:<br />The printer is very sleek. It's a shiny, gloss black with a matte finish along the sloped rim at the top. The only downside to this is the attraction of dusk, hair and the fingerprints. Even then those aren't enough to take away from the beauty of this printer. It features a 3 inch color display; not a touch screen. I found the interface to be quite intuitive and easy to navigate through. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the buttons light up as you need them, eliminating visual "clutter". The design of the printer is very nice. There are many features to access such as the pop out ADF, the flatbed scanner, the inside containing ink replacement, the rear paper feeder, & the memory card ports which are all WELL concealed. Looking at the printer looks simple, but all these features are there.<br /><br />Performance:<br />Start up time typically was about 3 seconds and it stopped making noise at about 8 seconds which is very fast. The printer emits a slightly loud noise within the first 3 seconds, but after that its internal parts are quiet. Printing is a medium level of loudness and takes about an average amount of time to print. Printing double sided documents took longer as expected, just so you know (but not much).<br /><br />Features:<br />I love the wifi feature! Setting it up was easy as pie. Just use the onscreen menu on the printer to connect to your network and then go to the desired computer and let the install CD do the rest. No delay times on wifi. I was surprised to see how quickly from the moment I clicked print to the printer printing my document. I was also very impressed by the ADF on top which is used to copy or scan up to 35 pages in various modes including: 1 sided to 1 sided, 1 sided to 2 sided and 2 sided to 2 sided. Another thing I enjoyed was the use of templates. Say your out of paper and you need lined paper or graph paper, just go to the templates and print your own paper out.<br /><br />Printing:<br />I was happy with the print jobs. They were about on par with other printers I've seen, nothing too special unless you want to print in high quality all the time. A little thing I liked was when a print job is sent to the printer and the door is still closed, it will automatically open; however it will not retract once complete. Paper tray holds a decent amount of paper and it located at the bottom. Lastly, the photo quality blew me away the most. The printer came with five free glossy photos, so I tried it out anyway. I took some shots from my camera, inserted the SD card right into the printer, found a photo i liked, and printed it. The quality looked comparable to what youd expect at walmart to get your photos done. Im dead serious it looked damn good and afterwards I checked the ink levels which were still good, not even a dent.<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with this printer. Although there are some minor dislikes over the printer, the pros outweigh the cons. The heavy duty tank of a printer is solid; none of the parts feel "cheap" like those stupid Brother printers. Don't ever buy a Brother printer lol I swear they SUCK. Anyways no problems so far. I have been very impressed with the printer and all of its features. It would suite any user from the basic home use to the small office/business user without any doubt. I highly recommend this printer. You will not realize the world of a difference a multifunction printer like this can make in your life until you experience it firsthand. Trust me.;;5.0;;August 3, 2011;;11;;11;;1.0

We use only Canon inks and tend to stick to Ilford Premium Pearl photo paper and the quality is just amazing!  We picked these printers up when there were rebates available for purchasing with Canon DSLR bodies, so the price was great too.<br /><br />The only minor downsides (specific to our business) for this printer are:<br />(1) These guys are heavy!  this is not really a knock on the printers since the quality and potential are just so great, but before you buy, if you know you're going to be lugging it around everywhere, you might want to hit the gym a little!<br />(2) The printing could be a little faster.  There are times at events when I'll wish the printer didn't take so long print.  The actual speed of printing is pretty reasonable, its just that often theres a little delay (many seconds) between the print job being sent and the actual printer starting the printing.  That's often enough for a mini-line to start forming of people waiting for their printouts.<br /><br />All in all though, these printers have just been super reliable for our purposes.  We haven't had any issues--mechanical or otherwise--to complain about.  Highly recommended!;;4.0;;February 8, 2011;;9;;9;;1.0

For this purpose, it has worked fine, although it will not transmit scans wirelessly, only via USB cable, which is a pain.<br /><br />My kids have played around printing fun things on this printer and now the black ink has run out-  no worries because I just really need it for scanning, right?  WRONG!  Once the ink runs out, the printer displays a message that you need to replace the ink cartridge, and it disables every function until you do:  scanning, printing, copying, setup.  I don't need ink to scan, but now I can't use the printer at all until I order a new cartridge.  And in the mean time, I can't do my online banking.  I feel like my scanner is being held hostage by the ink cartridge police.  My dinosaur of a scanner that this replaced let me scan forever without ink, and it never occurred to me that this would do otherwise.

Got a computer guy in to add another router to boost the signal and got the printer set up no problem using the CD.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. Color multifunction laser - allows me to save tons of $$ by printing my own advertising materials<br />2.

Good price - I did a lot of research before purchasing this printer and it seemed to be the best for the price.<br />4. Nice appearance<br />5. Lots of features - allows you to customize color profiles, turn alarms on/off, set up your networking preferences, etc.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Cartridges cannot be re-filled - at least my local shops can't re-fill them.<br />2. Can't handle heavy cardstock - If you plan to print on cardstock, contact Samsung or check out the website - they do indicate the max weight on there. I've sort of solved this problem by standing there and manually shoving the paper in.<br />3. Only one paper-feed tray - I like to have 2 trays - 1 for colored paper, but that's not an option with this printer.<br />4. Gets hot - tried using it to print brochures and ended up with a bunch of brochure papers all stuck together. Maybe the paper should have been more heat-resistant but regardless, the printer does seem to get pretty hot after 20 pages or so.<br />5. Printing a bit splotchy with new cartridges - takes a while to get the cartridges going.<br /><br />Overall, a great purchase and serves it's main purpose.

Set up for the printer was rather complex since we have a Verizon Fivespot for our internet service.

Come to find out, the printer will not take card stock, and the thicker paper could actually ruin the printer. This also was not mentioned in the product description, and fortunately another reviewer pointed it out before I destroyed the printer by using the wrong paper.  There is a list of types of paper it will take, but I didn't pay attention to it. I assumed that a printer of this price and quality would accept card stock. Even crummy little printers will take card stock.  It will only print up to 24lb paper, (regular paper is 20lb) and you can't find this information until you have purchased the printer and read through the "user guide" that comes online with the software (it is not mentioned in the little instruction manual that comes in the box).<br /><br />We haven't tried printing any photos, scanning, copying, or faxing.  We don't have a phone line so there's no need for the fax.<br /><br />And one last thing:  don't believe that video that shows a color copy zooming out of the printer in 2 seconds.  Not even close.

I spent a couple of days researching other options for my home office.  I was really looking for a wireless printing option that is customizable through "apps" that can be downloaded to the printer.  I ran across The Lexmark Pinnacle Pro 901 at a brick-and-mortar store.  I read some really good online reviews of it and decided to give it a try and ordered it through Amazon at about $50 off the brick-and-mortar store.<br /><br />Compared to the HP, this printer is a JOY to use.  Set up was easy as pie and it works exactly as advertised.  I was up and running with my printer connected to my wireless network within about 20 minutes.<br /><br />The "apps" (which Lexmark calls SmartSolutions) have a ways to go.  They are mostly just smart buttons which are programmable to perform repetitive tasks (for example, scanning a document and emailing it).  I am hopeful that more companies will create apps for Lexmark which allow printing of boarding passes, maps, directions, restaurant menus, etc. directly from the printer.<br /><br />For now, I am so happy with this all-in-one printer.

This printer can print large formats from two different sides. Unfortunately it will jam if the paper is smaller than recommended size.<br /><br />This beast, as I like to call it is huge and heavy, and at start-up it's quite loud. But printing is quiet and fast.<br /><br />Quality of prints comes down to program profile and paper. Since this printer can print jaw dropping images, stunning illustrations and tiny type that will be visible. Program profile varies by computer so I had to experiment to find right one that syncs with what I see on the screen. But paper, this can either kill your work or make it stand out. So don't expect amazing prints with low quality paper.<br /><br />I have two problems with this printer though:<br />1)There are 8 inks and that last as you would expect. The problem is that Green and Red color are not being used, even when printing in RGB setting instead of CMYK. So you're forced to buy way over five rounds of other inks before R and G will empty. I see this as a huge problem as I already bought C/M/Y/PC/PM/K colors over 5 times and R/G colors are still around 90% full. Seriously, if you're printing standard red on white, why not use straight up red ink? This aggravated me when I ran out of ink.<br /><br />2)The printing size. It can print on 13x19 inch paper, which is great, but nothing longer. If you have something that is 13x21, it won't let you. I would love if it could print long paper, as long as it would fit width wise. Also some paper setting are restricted to size as well. Had to work around it in few projects. So if you want to print a long poster or something, you're restricted to 19 inch of length.<br /><br />That's it, overall, I love this beast. It's the best printer I've used, even my acquaintances thought I print my stuff at some print shop they don't know about.;;4.0;;June 28, 2010;;11;;11;;1.0

The product description for this printer on the HP web site states, "Fax, scan and copy unattended, and handle two-sided documents, using the 50-page automatic document feeder." After unpacking and assembling the printer, I searched the animated help that comes with the software for a description of how to perform a 2-sided scan, and sure enough it described the procedure. Great, only the software doesn't support this feature. (The menu options described in the animated help don't exist.) HP telephone and email support was abysmal. After several days, I eventually got through to someone who understood the problem, but they flatly refused to accept a return, saying that it was an issue for the retailer. Fortunately, Beach Camera (via Amazon) accepted the return, and $35 lighter (for shipping), I got a refund.<br /><br />I ended up buying a Canon MX870 with which I'm very happy.;;1.0;;November 26, 2010;;56;;61;;0.918033

It connects directly to our home network, which means I don't have to turn my wife's computer (or vice versa) on to print.  Perfect printer for a home office for a great price.  Replacing our old inkjet printer for a laser was by far the best decision we could have made.<br /><br />Our review:<br />My wife needed a copier (she has a home office) and our inkjet was acting funny for the last few weeks.  We had been spending $[...] every six weeks in ink cartridges and were getting tired of it.  So we looked into laser printers and figured out that if we spent twice as much upfront in a laser printer, in the long run we were going to save money.  Every one told us that bar Xerox (incredibly expensive), HP made the best printers.  We compared Canon, Brother and HP B&W laser printers and found that the m1212nf was the best deal: flat bed, automatic feeder (for when you need to copy a bunch of single pages), and a price tag comparable to lesser quality printers.<br />Truly plug-and-play for a Vista computer (my wife's), you don't even need a CD since the drivers are stored IN the printer. Painless installation for Linux (Ubuntu 10.4), as well. You just need to download HPLIP's latest version from HP's website.  It is that easy.<br />The printer is connected through an Ethernet cable to our LAN, and I can print wirelessly over WiFi, no need to turn my wife's computer on.<br />A flat bed cum auto feeder gives you the greatest flexibility possible to scan and copy documents.<br />Its footprint is a little big, but this is a multifunction device, so what are you going to do?  It sits quite nicely over one of those small file cabinets.<br />Overall is a well built piece of equipment: it's sturdy and it works as intended.

This is our networked printer, so our 5-person office all use it. We do a lot of printing and a lot of it is graphical and colorful.<br /><br />When it comes to printing a single envelope, it jams the printer. We get around that by printing labels instead or using a different network printer to do envelopes. It was out of warranty when I discovered the issue; I wonder if it was a manufacturer's defect in our machine (and may not be a problem in most machines.)<br /><br />Print speed is very fast (it just takes about 15 seconds to warm up before first page out, then easily prints text only at 30 pages per minute (ppm)). It takes a long time to print graphics-heavy PowerPoint presentations, but if you're printing multiple copies of a presentation, the first print is very slow and subsequent copies are quicker. Color graphics are excellent and crisp, and so is black text.<br /><br />I would recommend this printer as long as you don't need to print envelopes.;;4.0;;May 20, 2011;;7;;7;;1.0

Although I enjoyed the photo capabilities of the inkjet, it just didn't do it when I needed important black & white copies or color copies of my excel financial workbooks. I wanted a color laser printer but not at the expensive business prices plus it had to be wireless, network ready, & both Mac & PC friendly. Until I saw this Brother printer, no home color laser met all those requirements.<br /><br />I was a bit apprehensive with this purchase since I had always owned HP printers & respect their reliability. But I have been using the Brother printer for over a month. It has far exceeded my expectations! Once I got rid of the cheap inkjet paper & replaced it with higher quality laser paper, the print jobs really shined. It is both a joy to print out my work financial statements in color and print jobs for every day use. I recently printed out my tax returns & enjoyed the laser black & white capabilities sorely missed with the inkjet.<br /><br />This is the perfect printer for a home office. It is built like a small tank too (nothing cheap about the quality). Although I was a bit put off having to buy four print cartridges (at $40-$50 each), after shopping online I found some good buys. Plus, the output is more than double from anything you get from inkjet cartridges. The only thing it can't do are photos. But, I kept my HP inkjet for those jobs. I highly recommend this color laser printer (btw, Brother calls it digital color LED print technology).;;5.0;;March 27, 2010;;15;;16;;0.9375

It was easy to set up and the wireless feature is great since we have two laptops in the house and switching cables would be a pain.  The print quality is good and it prints fast.<br /><br />The bad; this thing can't print a color photo on any kind of paper.  It prints way too much ink (smears all over clothes and hands) and the photo looks terrible.  I would not buy this product for photo printing.  I have an Olympus Tough 6000 camera and have tried printing from files on the laptop and direct from the camera.  Since I didn't buy it for photo printing, I don't really care and it is too much of a hassle to box it back up and send it back to Amazon even though returns are usually easy with Amazon.<br /><br />Buy it if you want a cheap printer that can do good text and in color or black and white.

So when Xerox came out with the 3300 MFP I was interested in seeing how it compared.<br /><br />While the part number maybe close, the machines are completely different. The 3300 MFP is more rugged, with a real paper tray (optional add on paper trays available), a lower cost per page, and better paper handling. It offers all of the features you would expect on a modern laser, scan to e-mail, network scanning, printing, and faxing. I have purchased 5 of these so far (now 10). The initial firmware these some of the units shipped with was buggy and as noted by another reviewer the Web user interface (UI) did not work in IE and other browsers. However, Xerox soon corrected that problem with a significant firmware update that corrected the UI and even required new drivers on the work stations.<br /><br />Setup and administration was very strait forward via the Web interface (nearly identical to any other Xerox copier). You can import address books for fax and e-mail, and tweak all of the default settings. I have had no complaints from the users and with 9+ (now 14+) months of usage under there belt, these printers continue to perform well.<br /><br />Other vendors may have similar products, but one area Xerox has really shined is there onsite technical support. While no of my 3300's have required onsite services, Xerox has always come through for me on other units I have installed. (The onsite warranty is an optional add on.) (I have had one ADF feeder that had some problems jamming but they were quick to repair it)<br /><br />So where does this unit come short? It does not support SSL for SMTP which means if you use Gmail or some other vendor that requires SSL for SMTP you are going to have trouble. One work around to this is setting up a computer running STUNNEL ([...]) a free open source project that you can use to proxy through. The other feature lacking is LDAP support for a centralize e-mail address list. The only other "weakness" it has is a limited darken/lighten range when making copies. It has this feature but it does not have the same range that a full blown copier has.<br /><br />Bottom line if you are looking for a solid, cost effective, multifunction unit, in my opinion, this is it. (Revised this review because it does support duplexing which I had incorrectly stated it did not. My review is other wise still the same after more than a year of usage.);;5.0;;April 28, 2010;;8;;8;;1.0

And I'm not referring to the price of the printer.<br /><br />Epson made some horrible choices for the 1400:<br /><br />- The ink cartridge is unique and, incompatible with all their existing lines.<br />- The cartridges are very hard to find.<br />- The cost of each cartridge is $20 plus and there are six of them.<br />- They are not available in discounted packs.<br />- If you actually try and print photos with this printer (rather than just text and the occasional web page) you'll spend between $50 and $100 a month on ink.<br />- If you print a lot of large photos - the poster size - you'll spend even more.<br />- Almost no ink refillers stock this cartridge.

Was worried about the noise level after reading reviews, but after having used it for myself, noise level does not bother me since it is completely silent on ready/standby and we'd choose quicker noisier printing over slower quieter printing any day.  We were quite happy with our purchase for the first several print jobs - the problem came after we tried to manually feed an envelope.  Every time we tried to print afterwards, we'd get an error saying to clear a jam on tray 2.  Obviously, we knew that there wasn't a jam because the envelope got printed (quite well, btw) and there were no jams prior to that (we checked anyway).<br /><br />So we called HP support with the mindset that we'd probably have to return the product for refund/exchange since we don't have very high expectations of customer support to begin with.  The first surprise was that we got a hold of a real person within probably a minute at most.  The rep went through the usual troubleshooting procedures that you might expect, but found nothing interesting.  Then after placing me on hold for about 5 minutes, he came back and asked me to try and follow some instructions to remove the main roller from the top of the paper tray.  This was the first procedure that we weren't expecting as it was somewhat involved and getting the roller back on was even more trickier.  Nevertheless, with my wife's help (she has smaller hands) we were able to get the roller back on (after putting the rep on hold for about 10 minutes).  At this point, the only interesting thing discovered as to the cause of the paper jam indicator was that the main roller in fact does NOT move when it is supposed to in trying to feed itself the paper.  So while we were getting a bit closer to trying to solve the problem, it also seemed as though we were exhausting all of the procedures the rep could offer in trying to figure out now what's causing the roller not to move - that is, until after he put me on hold for yet another 5 minutes and came back with the second surprise which I would have never thought they'd ask me to do over the phone.  They asked me to completely remove the right side panel of the laser printer with a screw driver.  Once we did that we noticed a plastic arm that was obviously not connected to anything else and moving freely.  We had a hard time explaining to the rep exactly what we were looking at, so we asked if we can snap a few photos and send it to him.  Having received them, he pointed out to us where this dangling arm was supposed to hook up to and lo and behold, that fixed the problem!  The rep was quick to point out that the procedure of opening up the side panel is something they don't recommend the average user to do, but because we were able to take off the main roller and put it back on we unknowingly passed this little test to show we were quite competent to go even further.<br /><br />Having said all of this, we were quite ecstatic to have a working printer again without having to go through the pain of shipping it back, not to mention we were quite pleased with the price of this model since there is no other HP-branded laser printer of this price that has both network capabilities and double-sided printing!<br /><br />Although the total duration of the call with HP's customer support was about 2 hours, we couldn't be happier with this product along with their customer support if HP is successful in providing similar levels of support and value to other customers who purchase this item.  Hope you enjoyed this review as I tried to be fair and include a lot of details so that it might be beneficial to some people out there who might encounter a similar problem.;;5.0;;August 5, 2009;;59;;61;;0.967213

What is not being stated is that this printer can only run a small fraction of the total applications available. No maps, no boarding passes, limited news etc.<br /><br />What makes this worse is that there does not appear to be any easy way to determine if the applications that you want are compatible with the printer you purchased until after you register the printer on HP's web site.  In order to do this you must unpack and use the printer - this makes it almost impossible to return if not satisfied.<br /><br />I fail to see any reason that HP could not make easily available an list of which applications will run on which of their products before purchase. It appears to me that HP is deliberately hiding the poor functionality of their product so that the customer cannot make an informed decision.<br /><br />To be fair, I did find the setup of this printer (MAC) to be extremely easy even though the manual leaves a lot to be desired. The print quality and speed is acceptable although nothing spectacular. I have tried to use the e-print function and it worked well on the email attachment although the cover page of the email was printed too small to be acceptable. Processing of the email took less than five minutes.<br /><br />In summary, I would suggest that anyone considering this printer for the applications be very, very careful prior to purchase.

This also requires that you open the back door of the printer.<br /><br />2.  You can't stack more than 3 (that's right ... three).  And you have to remove them from the back tray one at a time as they are printed.<br /><br />3.  It can be very frustrating to get the setting right to get it to print envelopes at all.  Some symptoms of this are:<br />  a.  It will refuse to print unless you close the rear door, which you can't do when using the MP for envelopes.  Not cool.<br />  b.  It will complain about a paper size mismatch for the duplexer, even though you very clearly specified no duplexing when you sent the printout.<br /><br />4.  Unless you know about the secret levers (keep reading!) it will crease them severely.<br /><br />Solutions (which it took me over 2 hours to figure out...you're welcome):<br /><br />1.  Be sure DUPLEX is set OFF on the main printer configuration menu.  You can still print duplex on paper, it just won't be the printer default.  This isn't usually a problem.  You can generally set duplex as a default somewhere in your printer software if you want to, so you won't notice.  Or you can select it in your software on an as-needed basis, which will also work fine.  But if you don't set DUPLEX OFF on the printer configuration menu, it will throw a fit about the duplexer and demand you close the rear door whenever you try to print envelopes.<br /><br />2.  Inside the BACK door, toward the bottom, there are two small blue levers, one on each side.  Push them both down to the Envelope setting.  This prevents creasing, although they will still be slightly curled until they rest for a minute.  You don't need to do this for any other kind of paper (including thick paper), just envelopes.  I've heard you can just leave them down ... I plan to try that.<br /><br />3. Unless you are printing Commercial-10 size envelopes, you should probably do a (usually one time) Custom paper size setup in your software.  There are other selections, but rumor has it that setting up a custom size is the better way to go for sizes other than Com-10.<br /><br />4. On the printer's Paper menu, set the paper size for the MP tray to ANY.  Paper type can be left as Plain.<br /><br />There you go ... Envelopes 101.  Enjoy.;;4.0;;November 17, 2010;;29;;29;;1.0

I didn't buy another HP because the newer ones seem really bulky, I didn't want a touchscreen, and the Canon was priced much more attractively for a similar feature set (I really wanted duplex ADF capability.)<br /><br />The print quality seems okay so far, although I honestly don't care that much about it; if I want photo quality, I will have real prints made or head off to Kinkos.  This unit is primarily for printing the reservation confirmation, a document I want to review on paper and mark up, or a set of printed directions.  For al of those things, what I care about is the amount of time from when I hit print until I have a completed document in hand.  For that, this printer seems painfully slow.  It seems to spend most of its time preparing to print; something my old HP almost never did.  Once it finally starts it doesn't seem bad, so maybe it is fine for long documents that you expect to take a little while.<br /><br />I will see how it goes otherwise.  As with every printer that I have tried except expensive office multifunctions, the scan from the printer functionality is "heavier" than I would like; my ideal is to have it be able to drop it into a network folder automatically, with no need for special software on the receiving end.  The software that is required doesn't seem to be terrible, however, so it will probably be okay.<br /><br />Also no opinion yet on ink usage.  I tend to only ever refill the black on my printers, but we'll see how annoying the warning messages become.<br /><br />Overall, I want an updated version of my old HP, which this is not.  Unfortunately, neither are the current HP's.;;3.0;;August 24, 2012;;5;;6;;0.833333

The old one worked perfectly for several years.<br /><br />When I found out that Brother was offering this new MF Printer with 11 x 17 output capability I was tempted to buy one because I frequently print/fax/copy floorplan drawings.  Then when I found out that it was less than $300 on Amazon I purchased one immediately and gave my old MF Printer to a friend.<br /><br />I have not been disappointed.  It was easy to set up and working in a matter of minutes.  The warm up cycle at the beginning of a print job is a little slow, but fairly typical for this type of machine.  I haven't found any complaints with it.  The ability to print/fax/copy/receive 11 x 17 drawings is awesome.<br /><br />I fully expected that the downside to this printer would be the cost of the ink cartridges.  Wrong again!  Replacement Ink cartridges, in both black and color, were relatively cheap and available in XL and XXL capacities.<br /><br />One last thing.  This is not a photo printer.  Color printing is sharp and acceptable for most business applications, but don't expect to print photos.<br /><br />This is a great, inexpensive business printer.

So, I decided to save my penies. I have had this printer for about 2 weeks or so. I cannot complaine at all!!<br />I did a decent amount of research on this product before I decided to drop the cash for it. Unfortunatly, reviews are few and far between. Everything I heard and saw about the printer was from Canon press releases or the Web site. Not exactly a non-biased pool of information. But non the less, I took the plunge and got it. I have not regreated it one bit!<br />It offers large 13x19 borderless printing, amazing color reproduction, and it can even adjust the color for the type of light the photo will be viewed under. Canon also offers a full range of fantastic photo paper. I enjoy the look and feel of the Canon Photo Rag. This paper though, does not support boarderless printing. Make sure you read the print on the paper. Ink does not seem to fly out of the tanks. I have printed about 20 or so prints, and I have only had to replace the matte black tank (I do a lot of night shooting and had a bit of a learning curve to understand my new printer. It might last longer depending on your style and experience).<br />Since this is my first real photo printer, I had a bit of learning to do when I first plugged it in. However, the included "electronic manuel" had all the information that I needed. I was soon printing fantastic large color and B&W prints.<br />The construction is solid. It is not a flimsy bit of plastic that will fall apart! Opperation is quiet and fast. I have not exactly timed how long it takes to print, but it is done with a 13x19 print in just a few min. It does have a large footprint. So be ready to have some desk space! Some papers are too thick to use the top loader, ie museum etching, so you will have to front feed them. The prints will come out the back of the printer. So depending on what you print on, you will need to have the back of your printer open and free of clutter.<br />Over all, this printer is amazing! I know Canon has gotten some heat over its performance on glossy paper. I do not normaly print on glossy paper and have not yet done so with this printer. But on the Photo Rag Paper the prints are amazing. And the print is the important thing. Photos are ment to be seen, and this printer does an amazing job creating a print. I would definatly recomend this printer!!;;5.0;;July 3, 2009;;74;;84;;0.880952

By volume, we use about 1/4 of a ream of paper per week. In a broad description, the Epson printers are superior in print quality, but require the owner's manual to be at hand to determine what the problem is when one of the indicator lights starts flashing.<br />I have been an HP fan but this printer has changed all that.<br /><br />Please believe the other negatives mentioned in the reviews. They will all add up to a serous dissatisfaction with this printer.<br />The challenges with this printer are:<br />* - It will frequently stop in the middle of a print job to check itself. This can take from 60 seconds to a few minutes. This occurs about twice per day. If you are printing a large document, say 50 pages or more, plan on this delay happening at least once and perhaps twice during the print job. When it is printing it is fast, but the overall throughput is greatly reduced by these delays.<br />* - It will error out (all the lights start flashing) and you must power off the printer to reboot. This occurs about once per week and can even happen in the middle of a print job.<br />* - It cleans the print heads far too frequently - and can run out of ink (excess consumption) in the middle of the process.<br />* - Like most of today's printers, it will not use all of the ink in the cartridge before it stops printing until you replace the cartridge.<br />* - When connected wirelessly to a computer it will frequently take itself off-line. It will then refuse to print until several documents have been sent to the printer queue and it decides it is time to reconnect.<br />* - HP's auto-load software will "crapify" your computer. It is not content with simply being a printer/scanner peripheral, it wants to become part of the operating system. It installs several programs (Windows) which run in the background and slow down the entire system. About 2 times per week, one of the HP Pinter Monitoring programs errors out and must be closed out. Interestingly, this seems to have no effect on the operation of the printer - who knows why it is there.<br /><br />This machine, when it is not doing it's own thing, is fast and produces good (not great) document quality and poor photo quality. The scanner is excellent, but about 5% of the time the scanner software will error out in the middle of a scan and require the software to be re-launched.<br /><br />Hopefully HP will correct these programming issues in future models, but the value and performance of the 8500 series is greatly reduced because of them.;;2.0;;March 1, 2011;;25;;25;;1.0

The regular black ink cartridge is around $10 to $15 in the store, which may not seem bad in comparison to some other cartridges out there, but the fact that these cartridges are very small is what causes the cartridges to not be very economical. Since HP no longer lists this on the packaging, the 61 black cartridge yields 190 pages, and the 61XL black yields 480 pages. The 61 color yields 165 pages, and the 61XL color yields 330 pages. In case you're unfamiliar, these quotes by HP are sometimes a bit exaggerated, and one can only expect to achieve these yield amounts when using the draft setting on the printer, which sacrifices image quality for the sake of using less ink and printing at faster speeds. The color cartridge has all three of the colors in one single cartridge, and when one color runs out, you have to replace the entire cartridge. Almost always, the yellow goes first, which means I waste what was left of the cyan and magenta inks wen buying the new cartridge. If you're looking to save a few bucks on the ink, you can purchase the cartridges from Sophia Global here on Amazon, which is a company that refills empty cartridges in the factory and resells them for anywhere from $2 to $5 less than a normal cartridge. These cartridges, which I have used in my printer, have print quality on par with the OEM inks, and tend to yield a few more pages than the original inks. As for the printer itself, I am pleased with the print speed and quality, but it feels somewhat cheap for an HP. I do like that it's very light, weighing about half of what some other comparable printers weigh. I upgraded to this when my old HP DeskJet 710C from a few years ago died, when its page count was just over 120,000. I don't expect this printer to last that long, but it doesn't seem like a low-quality machine, either. I would say that 15PPM would be an average speed for black and white copies in draft mode. I know that this didn't come with a cable to hook it up to the PC, but I had a whole drawer full of them, so it doesn't really matter. It's not loud enough to have the neighbors startled next door, but not quiet enough to fall asleep to. It's quiet compared to my dad's LaserJet 9000, which literally sounds like he let a lawnmower loose inside the house. The input tray holds only about 50 pages, which is why it may feel as if you're always running out of paper. One downside about it is that there's no low-ink indicator on the printer itself, so one has to connect it to the computer to see how much ink they have left. All in all, it seems like a good buy with lots of bang for your buck, even if the cost per page can be quite lofty.;;4.0;;November 8, 2011;;7;;7;;1.0

They print<br />a fairly nice photo and do text excellently.  What we like more was<br />that this printer has a OPTION to print only Black without the use<br />of the Color Cartridge in case you are low or out of it (found in the<br />Maintenance  section under "ink cartridges settings" ).  And this<br /> a good idea because this printer loves eating Color ink up quickly.<br /><br />We printed 50 color pages under the "standard" level until it ran out<br />of Color ink (this was using the extra long life cartridge).  Black seems<br />to last longer. Like most reviewers have said, this printer is small and<br />takes up little room and has no paper output tray.  It is simple to install<br />and gives you the option to just install the driver and bypass all the<br />bloat ware.<br /><br />Also, this printer is noisy, but has a option to operate under "quiet<br />mode".  In addition, the printer has auto power (turn on auto and turn off<br />power if their is no activity after a chosen period of time.. (most<br />Canon models do).

I actually like that it does NOT have all of the extra multifunction junk I don't need.  Print quality is great; good contrast, no colors seem to be over saturated, and nice detail.  I actually prefer the matte finish of an ink jet over the glossy finish of a laser for what I wanted to do.  I disagree with other reviews about it being slow or noisy.  I leave it on all the time but it goes to 'sleep' automatically; waking it up and printing is very quick.  However if you shut it down all the way then yes it takes a minute or two for it to boot up.  Noise is a mater of perspective and preference; my first printer was dot matrix with tractor feed; that's a loud printer!  This printer doesn't bother me; it's quiet enough.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very happy with the print quality.  I bought it mostly to print out card stock models which have detailed textures, lots of color, and I wanted good quality at a cheap price... this printer delivers just that.<br /><br />Ink cost per cart is actually pretty low compared to most.  Just buy the larger sized ones if you do moderate to heavy printing because you're going to blow through them.  Honestly though if you're going to be printing a lot just go buy a color laser; the price per page is lower in the long run.  I know HP claims this thing is cheaper to print with than a color laser but it's all a numbers game... it's really not when you come down to the reality of printing.  I wanted an inkjet because most color lasers print too dark, magenta is over saturated, and I don't like the glossy finish for my cardstock models.  If those things don't matter to you then color laser really is the way to go.<br /><br />Handles heavy cardstock (110 lb) with NO issues.  Automatically feeds it it and will even do the auto duplex with the heavy cardstock.  This was a big deal for me and it does exactly what I need it to.<br /><br />Auto duplex is neat.  I rarely use it but when I do I really like it.  Manual duplex is annoying!<br /><br />Has four separate ink carts.  I really like this because you only need to replace the color cart runs out.  With ink carts that have all colors combined you have to throw out the whole thing when only one color is gone.<br /><br />Wireless is nice; I didn't really care at first but I ended up having to use it because the software sucked so bad.  I just couldn't get it to work reliably over the USB cable (maybe that's why they don't supply one!)  It also has a regular RJ45 jack for an ethernet connection to.<br /><br />Print head is separate.  This is a huge deal for longevity.  That's usually the first thing to kill your consumer level ink jets.  The print head gets clogged up or burnt out, can't be easily cleaned, typically is integrated (not removable), and when it gets this way the whole printer is junk.  With this one the print head can be removed and replaced; one of the most underrated features of this printer that should be pointed out every time.  Read all of the other reviews on other inkjets that people loved for 6 months to a year, then the print head got clogged or burnt up beyond repair, and now the printer is garbage.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Setup was a 4+ hour process and I'm not a novice when it comes to computers (software or hardware) or even printers.  I've installed and operated Xerox plotters with their own servers and software, business class multifunction centers, lasers, ink jets, dot matrix, of all different manufacturers over the last 15 years.... NONE of them have been as annoying to setup the software for as this printer.  Hands down, bar none, the most annoying and buggy software I've ever delt with for a printer.  (second place would be the Xerox XES 54" plotter) The install software would just sit there for 30 minutes at a time doing nothing and then fail!  Instructions CLEARLY said do NOT plug it in until asked... sometimes it would never ask me and then fail to install.  Other times it would ask me to plug it in then fail to recognize the device and fail installing.  I ended up just setting it up for wireless (which was it's own nightmare because the same crappy software needs to run to do this) and doing it that way when I would have preferred the higher speed USB connection.  That said now it's up and running with no problems since so after a frustrating night it's been solid ever since.  So this is what I mean by sacrificing time for money; it's cheap but you spend a lot of time setting up the thing.<br /><br />It's an ink vampire to say the least.  The ink carts claim you can get 300 pages under 'normal' printing.  Now I'll be first to admit that I'm doing full page color prints (read: not 'normal' printing) but I'm only getting about 80 pages per cart.  The quality is great but it really soaks the ink to make that quality.  Thankfully there is a 'draft' mode if you don't care about quality and it spits out jobs VERY fast using far less ink.  So far I see no difference in quality or ink consumption between normal and high quality.;;4.0;;April 15, 2010;;6;;7;;0.857143

So it is totally impossible to set it up wirelessly unless you have a computer with an older OS.<br /><br />Even if you have OS 10.4 installed, as I do on another machine, the wireless set-up is excruciatingly painful and --- when all is said and done --- does not even work. There is discussion about this on the Apple boards, and the issue has never been resolved. It is possible that the printer is not compatible with some of the security protocols used by an Airport Extreme Base Station, as many users who experience these problems have that device.

I contacted Kodak and related my problem and my frustration and they did nothing but direct me to their standard troubleshooting sites. These of course have done nothing to correct the problem.

I read several information items and reviews before I decided to purchase the 9000. The first thing that troubled me was that Canon had the 9500 in Europe and wouldn't release it in the US, even though they indicated they would, and then they stopped sales for a recall????  The second issue had to do with minor issues that users were printing in blogs about the 9500 printer.  The third issued had to do with price.  The 9500 in the $800 to $900 range while I purchase the 9000 at Best Buy for $450.  I know I could have purchased it on the internet cheaper but I wanted a place to personally return it if I had problems.  I must say that I do not regret my choice.  The set up was easy.  Follow the instructions step by step, line by line. Mt first 2 prints were 4 x6, then I went for the 13 x 19 of 2 Thunderbirds, one up and one down.  The print was breathtaking.  I took it to a framer yesterday and she just marvelled over the print.  She advised me to enter the local photo contest next year because it was certainly the best print she saw after review of the entered prints.  I also printed some black and white photos and they are exceptional.  I can't comment on the 9500 but I made my choice on the reviews of the 2 printers, and the cost.  I'm an amature photographer, using a Canon 30D with a EF 70-200 IS, F2.8 lens, and the EF 28-70, f2.8.  I also shoot in raw data.;;5.0;;August 5, 2007;;19;;19;;1.0

Then used same setup disc to install on my wireless notebook, which in the end I think the printer is running through the Dlink Router to the wireless notebook. For my router I had to have some kind of code which I had saved from setting up the router. The printer has worked just like it is suppose to. No hick-ups. Which makes me happy. I choose to put new paper in tray one and recycle paper in tray two. Recycle is paper that already has something printed on one side that I don't need anymore. I want to print something on the good side that is not important enough to be printed on perfect paper. I already have printer set for tray 1 and just choose the other tray if need be on print window that pops up after clicking on print icon. I've only had this for a month or so. But am very happy so far, because it works and doesn't give me any trouble. I should say that my kids use some programs and when they try to print they don't always seem to have access to the set up window/page for all the options to the printer. Probably a fix for this I just haven't spent the time to figure it out. I used HP printers for years and they worked pretty good most of the time. Buuuut, when I needed to clean out the head cleaning tray that fills up with ink, I can't get to it without taking the case apart. OOOh that case, It's a real puzzle and I'd like to blank the designer right up side the head. From what I can tell it will be easy to clean out the head cleaner tray on the Lexmark. The touch screen works good. Registering the printer online with Lexmark corporate was easy to. You know Lexmark puts their 1-800# right inside the lid so easy and convenient. Well, just wanted to get someone real, ME. to put up a review that hopefully will help some of you out there who have gotten frustrated reading reviews that seem like with HP you ether get a good machine or a dud, I mean within the same model not to mention the price of ink for HP.

It produces terrific quality prints, at least for a laser printer.<br /><br />Its key features is that it is wireless and does double-sided printing automatically. You can place the printer anywhere in your home or office and it will print beautiful copies.  It uses 4 toners that print up to 2600 pages for color or up to 4000 pages for black with its high yield toner.<br /><br />My previous printer was the C P2025dn which I owned for 3-1/2 years and never had a problem with, except for 2 jams in its 46,000 page run.  I find that amazing!  Yes, jams are easy to correct by popping open the rear of the printer.<br /><br />I only have 3 negative concerns.  This printer comes with 4 starter cartridges that print only 1400 pages each.  When you are paying close to $500 for a printer, wouldn't you think that they would include full cartridges?  The previous model noted above did come with full toners.  Of course, HP does not advertise that these printers come with starter cartridges.  You can only find out by reading the small print on the toner itself or noting it on the outside packaging.  I could not find any HP documentation that informs the consumer that these are indeed starter toner cartridges.<br /><br />The print speed on this printer rated at 21ppm is exactly the same as my previous printer.  Wouldn't one think that 3-1/2 years later this speed could have been improved?  The M451dw is certainly not "slow," it's just that I would have hoped for a minor improvement in print speed.<br /><br />My last negative is HP's technical support.  Although the install was simple enough, I could not do the wireless install on my printer using a USB cable as their instructions indicate.  I talked to a technical support agent for over an hour who lead me into all kinds of sub-menus trying to activate the wireless feature.  Eventually he gave up and said he could go no further.  I hung up and re-tried to install software, only this time I hooked up a network cable instead of the USB cable as HP directed.  It worked right off the bat and has operated flawlessly ever since.<br /><br />If you're looking for a color laser printer you can always find one in the $200 price point.  But the Color LaserJet HP Pro 400 series produces truly outstanding graphics.  You truly get what you pay for!;;4.0;;May 22, 2012;;13;;13;;1.0

If you want to do either you really need to plug the printer directly to the computer.<br /><br />Other issues involve after-market ink.  This printer has problems identifying ink cartridges that are not made by Canon.  When I print something I always get an error message and have to go inside and play with a cartridge before it will print.  Often, once I get one cartridge to be identified another one will suddenly go missing.  It can be quite annoying.<br /><br />It can also be slow to print even with a strong wi-fi signal.<br /><br />While it is a nice printer overall, the shortcomings have already made me look at getting another printer once my current supply of cartridges runs out.  I like Canon printers but not this model.;;3.0;;July 24, 2010;;9;;9;;1.0

Why does this make me so mad? Because I just bought all 4 new cartridges (costing me over $35) less than 6 weeks ago and I haven't made very many prints. I've printed 0 photos. All my prints are mostly B&W, and I set the printer to "economy" setting on the ink. I turn the printer off when not in use (as the manual recommends to avoid drying out the cartridges).  I shake the cartridges, and they're still half full.<br /><br />But for some reason, this monster wants MORE INK.<br /><br />For the amount of money I spend constantly refilling the ink, I might as well just but a brand new printer each time instead of buying new ink!<br /><br />The MOST annoying thing about this printer is that it "locks up" if even one of the cartridges goes "empty". I want to print a B&W document, but it won't let me because the Yellow cartridge is "empty". ARGH!<br /><br />If you are a casual printer, this is not the machine for you.<br /><br />If you plan to print alot of B&W documents, color documents, or even (gasp!) an occasional photo, this printer may cause you to become Amish.<br /><br />If you want a really shiny paperweight, this printer is just what you're looking for!;;1.0;;August 26, 2007;;21;;22;;0.954545

This printer replaces a Cannon MP970 that has served me very well and prints photos of the highest quality.  I was disappointed in that the supplied ink cartritges that came with the printer had minimal ink and the first 2 cartritges failed the second day and were out of ink.  The new cartritges that I purchased are lasting longer.  Don't really know if this is a common practice by all manufacturers, but I think it is pretty cheezy on the manufacturers part.  The replacement cartritges are high, but not uncommon among other popular brands.  Set up was easy.  This printer seems to do better print quality than my older printer, although it uses a similar technology.  I like the simplicity of the paper feed trays.  I never had paper jams in my last printer and believe me, I ran a lot of paper through it over the years in a residential setting.  Our old printer was approximately 5 years old.  I like the Cannon printers much better than the HP printers, although I have no  recent experience with one.  My first printers were HP printers prior to the purchase of the Cannon MP970.  The Cannon MP970 was superior to the HP that was previously owned.;;4.0;;July 19, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

All my paper jam needs in one tight package.;;I've spent a lot of time trying to find a printer in this price range that would meet all of my paper jam needs. Then Brother comes along and BOOM - paper jams that exceed even what I imagined were possible. The Brother MFCJ625 features a "non-rolling" roll bar that traps paper on *every single print.* Yes, you read that right - no more worrying about whether the paper will jam or not, the guesswork is done. And with the built in Wi-Fi you can now jam paper wirelessly.<br /><br />"But wait," you say. "Why would I want to spend 2/3 of my day trying to dislodge bits of paper with tweezers from between the tiny teeth of a roll bar while holding a flashlight in my mouth?" Brother is already a step ahead of you. It may actually be 4:30 pm in the real world, meaning that you're now late for that meeting/kid's ball game/surgery you planned to attend. But the clock on the Brother MFCJ625DW will assure you that it's only 10:30 am, no matter how many times you reset it. It's like *gaining* 6 hours every single day.<br /><br />With the Brother MFCJ625DW, your paper jam issues will compound exponentially the more you use the printer. It's all part of Brother's "Watch Your Life Slip Away Moment by Moment" initiative, in which customers spend hours staring into the black abyss of the paper tray, cursing the day they were born. They've cleverly hidden all the places paper can actually get stuck behind immovable walls of cheap plastic and metal teeth. There's a compartment in the back that allows the majority of the paper to be extracted, but don't worry - no matter how gently you extract it, there will always be tiny bits left behind for you to find. Think of it as a micro-scavenger hunt that ends with you slashing your wrists in frustration. At this price point? That's a bargain and then some!<br /><br />Laptop users will especially enjoy the Brother MFCJ625DW. The marathon paper jams forever eradicate that pesky sense of freedom and portability you enjoy with longer laptop battery life and wi-fi connectivity. That's right, the Brother MFCJ625DW can jam paper no matter where you print from. This means you'll need to constantly move from your location back to the printer to fix the jam (don't forget your tweezers). It's great exercise, as is writing out your report, paper, or thesis by hand, just like your great-grandmother used to do. After you realize that no matter what you do, what type of paper you use, or what god you pray to, there is simply no way the Brother MFCJ625DW is ever going to successfully print without jamming, you can finally give up on the notion of productivity, creativity, and free time to spend with loved ones. But don't worry, the endless "spooling" messages that appear - on the rare occasion the printer actually communicates with you in anything other than arcane error codes - will give you a feeling of productivity that lasts, literally for hours.<br /><br />Get one today before the price goes up!

While the price was absolutely great, we ultimately spent more with our IT person for the time he spent trying to get this junk hooked up to our internal net.  The problem - absolutely no way to get the paper to feed...from the very first page.  And after doing some (belated) on-line research, we found that this is apparently a wide-spread problem with this printer.  The paper-feed mechanism is a paper-JAM mechanism.<br /><br />Yeah, you might get lucky and receive the one-in-a-hundred that actually work, but please save yourself the time and aggrevation.

It curls the paper when printing.<br /><br />2. The wireless feature could not be configured correctly.  Not sure where the problem was but I can tell you the software was not helpful.  After walking through a series of screens to configure your network setting, you come to a test page. If it cannot connect to the printer (which it never did) you can't go back and adjust the settings. (Is that crazy or what?) Instead, you are just bumped out of the process and have to reload the configuration tool again and type in all the same information again. (Did anyone test this at Brother, how could they have missed this?)<br /><br />What made it really nuts, was that trying to connect and failing would automatically reset the print's wireless receptivity to "OFF", so no matter what you did in the software setup tool, it wasn't going to work until you reset the printer to its factory settings (on the printer itself). YES, that's right: the printer resets itself to wireless OFF every time you go through the software configuration process. (Hello, tech support...)<br /><br />Pluses:<br />The sad thing (beside the visual design and functionally short comings) is it prints fine, if you don't mind curly paper.  I liked the quality of the prints. However buying a wireless printer than cannot be configured for wireless is a non-starter, and all my papers looking like bananas on my desk didn't do it for me.

Second, the text looks pretty good and the color graphics are very good. Don't buy any other printer that's slower. You will be frustrated! I've only had this printer a short time but so far am very pleased. Fast output and no paper jamming!!! One thing, the extra-cost battery is expensive, but if you need it, it's a wonderful add-on and its charge last quite a long time. I recently used this printer and it's battery all weekend for printing invoices at a show I was doing. Not a problem and at the end of the weekend the battery still had plenty of charge. It was great not having to plug in the printer to electricity. The Canon iP 90 is highly recommended. One other thing: some say the ink cartridges are small and don't last very long.

YES! For a week I kept looking at various color lasers at stores in town and online. Most of them were around $400 - 500. I read lots of reviews by computer magazines and individuals and they all had something negative to say. I just couldn't make up my mind. Then, I read the positive review about this printer in PC Magazine and figured that for such a small amount of money I could afford to make a mistake.<br /><br />Well, this has been a joy. I still can't believe how good it is. The print quality and color quality of the text is outstanding. I showed several pages to colleagues at work and nobody could tell the difference between what I had printed and what we use every day at work. This is perfect for my needs at home.<br /><br />I have not printed pictures, nor do I intend to. That's not something that interests me so I can't comment on how good it is doing that. But for quality text (including color text) this is excellent. The colors match what I see on screen. Green is a little off but the others are spot on. And it's plenty fast enough. Not sure this would work as a networked printer but for home it's perfect.<br /><br />There are lots of options available that I haven't even fooled with. Maybe I could even tweak the green color more to match the screen. I don't know.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope this helps someone. I was ready to spend $500 and I bet those printers wouldn't have done a thing better for me than this one.;;5.0;;September 25, 2009;;18;;22;;0.818182

I have submitted a request to return this new printer to the Amazon seller, LY Business of Needham, MA for the following reasons.<br /><br />1) Despite being a relatively new model of HP LaserJet printer, the installation disk does not contain printer drivers for Windows 7.<br />2) After downloading printer drivers from the Internet, the printer spits out a separate two-line "gobbledygook" page for each real page printed.<br />3) It might appear that the wrong drivers were selected from the Internet, but after having a professional technician spend one and a half hours, at a cost of $60  to attempt to resolve all issues, the problems remain.<br />4) This printer does not print clean copies.  I thought that after the first couple of print jobs the pages would come out clean but that is not the case.  Even after about 50 full pages being printed, the left hand margin still contains toner "overspray".<br />5) The noise level of this printer is, to say the least, excessive.  It is nowhere as quiet as the HP 2100 model that it was intended to replace.<br /><br />Based upon my experience with my older HP 2100 over a span of ten years and my recent experience with an HP 2055d printer, it would appear that HP has regressed in the technology of their printers.  My plans are to purchase a used HP 2300 LaserJet printer on eBay to replace my 2100 printer.<br /><br />12/10/2012 Update - Now that I've spent an extra $60 having a computer support person trying to get this printer to work properly and not spray toner in the left margin, and having asked Amazon to allow me to return it to their affiliate, LY Business, LY Business is now sending me all sorts of material that may - or may not - solve the issues I have with this printer.  Perhaps LY Business should include this material, including Firmware updates they sent, when they send the printer to their customers.  I've spent all the time and money that I intend to spend trying to get this printer work properly and all I want to do now is return it for a full refund.  I'll post LY Business' response to my return request when I obtain a definitive answer from them.;;1.0;;January 8, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

I wanted to upgrade my current printer to take advantage of this model's wireless and AirPrint capability.  Set-up was easy, although the printer needed a firmware update right out of the box to take advantage of AirPrint.  This can be downloaded at the canon website.<br /><br />Please note that you do need a printer cable (not included) for all firmware updates, so save your old cable or order a cheap one from Amazon when you order this printer.  The firmware set-up was kind of a pain, as the instructions had been poorly translated into English; once installed, AirPrint worked beautifully.  I had no problems printing from my iPad2, nor were there any problems printing from my computer.<br /><br />I tried printing photographs using the 4x6" size of both HP Premium Plus Photo Paper and Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy II.  The Canon photo paper produced far superior prints.  The background color of the photo printed on the HP paper was extremely muddled.

This has all of the main features we needed for use at home, and then some, including:<br /><br />* Wireless Networking, Wired Ethernet and USB Printing (did not test either), FAX, Duplex Printing (2-Sided), Standalone Copy and Scanning, included OCR (for converting scans to text), and an Automatic Document Feeder (50 page)<br /><br />The setup for my wireless network was fairly easy and took about 15 minutes. The installation software worked fine on both Windows 7 and Vista, stepping through every stage of the procedure. After installing the print cartridges (Black and three individual colors), the printer self-aligned, and reported ready. From the menu, I selected the Network option, selected Wireless, it scanned and found my home network SSID and asked for my Security Key. The printer came up on the network and the PC software found it right away.<br /><br />Printing from the PC was straight forward and worked exactly like it should. Using the scanner (TWAIN) from within applications like Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate worked perfectly as well.<br /><br />All of the advanced features I tried (PC FAX, Scanning to PDF and Email, OCR) worked perfectly and were easy to figure out. The included OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is provided from a program called "ABBYY FineReader 6.0 Sprint" and is surprising accurate. An interesting feature that I did not try is the ability to add "apps" to the printer, like RSS feeds and scripts. These can be downloaded from the Lexmark site.

It plods methodically along and (eventually) spits out nice-looking pages, no mistaking that. But if you are looking for an All-in-One, this is NOT it.  Reviews on other sites about this exact model, that say this machine faxes, are inaccurate.  It prints, copies, and scans.  Period.  Nicely, but that's all.  This machine has no more fax capability than any other average scanner that can scan to files, so you can then "send e-faxes" by actually sending your scanned files as email attachments to/through a paid email-to-fax service such as eFAX, which converts and delivers your files as faxes to the recipient's fax machine.  HP tries to make up for the lack of fax capability of this machine, by having some arrangement with the eFAX company to allow its printer owners to send 20 outgoing and receive 20 incoming e-faxes per month for free (there is an extra charge for more faxes than that, but I don't know how much).  Problem is, when I went to the HP eprint center site to set up eFAX for this printer, I got a message that says this printer model does not support Apps and therefore cannot be used with eFAX (which doesn't make much sense -- I mean, what is ePrinting or Air Printing from an iphone, if not an app?).<br /><br />So it looks like I'm back to square one when it comes to faxing, i.e. just scanning to files, and sending email PDF files through an online mail-to-fax service.  No biggie, as there are plenty of online fax services out there and I don't need to fax that often.  But it's still a pain.  I wish those tech reviewers on other web sites had paid better attention to what this machine really does, rather than assuming it faxes and saying it does.  And I wish I had paid better attention to actual tech specs instead of taking their word for it!<br /><br />Oh by the way, I have to add this little side note:  I was surprised to see that the "low toner" warning kicks in a LOT sooner than it needs to.  I don't know if that's good or bad.  All I know is that the "Low black" warning, saying I had less than 50 pages left to print using black, kicked in more than 200 black-printed pages ago, and the quality still looks normal.  We're talking pages of single- and double-spaced black type covering almost every page from top to bottom (not lots of black-heavy photos or pictures).  So don't change your toner cartridge just because it tells you to.  Wait until you actually need to.;;3.0;;May 6, 2012;;11;;11;;1.0

I knew when I bought it that the tray which catches printed pages is just a fold-out extension of the feeder tray, but I never imagined it was so poorly designed that it would grab printed pages and run them back through a second time if I didn't monitor every print job. Don't even get me started on the incessant "phantom" paper jams - I'm glad others addressed it here already.<br /><br />I also knew when I bought the D110 that the little ink cartridges wouldn't last long - but I've never had a printer blow through ink like this one does, and I've never had a printer that required so much force to install and remove cartridges when they (constantly) need changing. Not only does it eat ink at an alarming rate, but the print quality is horrible once you get down to 1/3 of any cartridge - certainly not good enough for photographic prints - and the machine wants to recalibrate the ink delivery system every time a cartridge is changed, wasting time and paper.<br /><br />The final insult is the regularity with which this printer becomes magically invisible to my computer, which is connected directly to this unit via cable.  If I turn the printer off and on again, it tries to reinstall another copy of itself, wasting up to ten minutes at a stretch.<br /><br />And yeah, it occurred to me early on that I might just have bought a bad unit, so I exchanged it, but the replacement has the same issues.  Tried pairing it with another, equally new HP computer.  Nope.  And wireless printing is a crapshoot every time.  Neither the retailer nor HP has any advice, though you can bet HP acts like they've never heard of any of the problems I'm having.<br /><br />I didn't buy my D110 from Amazon, but since I wouldn't want anybody else to go through the nonsense I've dealt with since I brought this nightmare home, I thought I'd put my two cents in where I know a lot of people will see it.;;1.0;;June 28, 2011;;19;;19;;1.0

(That is, I'm on my third printer. Before this, I used HP printers and I never EVER had a printer that needed replacing!)<br />(2) the printhead three (or has it been four?) times because of print quality problems! (According to Kodak, this is an $85 part.)<br /><br />(I will say Kodak's support is very good. You get right to the technician (always in India). They seem well-trained, and to their credit, they HAVE replaced the failing parts/printers.)<br /><br />And here's another reason not to buy a Kodak printer: the use of COLOUR printer ink. Kodak heavily advertises its low cost per printed page, and there is research out there to back that claim up.<br /><br />But what they DON'T tell you (ANYWHERE), is that EVEN if you print in draft mode and withOUT color, the printer consumes the color cartridge. And when the color cartridge runs out of ink, the printer will not print AT ALL. Even if the black cartridge is full of ink or even brand new.<br /><br />Check out the cost of a colour cartridge if you want to know what a drag that is. And this printer will NOT use "compatible" cartridges (like these: [...]). Only genuine (expensive) Kodak cartridges will do. I don't know if that's just a "feature" of the 9250 or if that applies to other models as well; clearly it's not a printer problem because I've tried "compatible" cartridges on all three printers.<br /><br />I've tried getting technical support to help with the issue of the use of colour, but can never get beyond the party line (it's almost like a script) of how they want to provide high quality printouts. (I'm a writer; most of my printing is drafts for editing; high quality is at the BOTTOM of my list. :- )<br /><br />I will NEVER buy another Kodak printer again.

And if you've got the space and the money, it's doable. But the lesson for the rest of us is to spread the love a little and let one machine do the color, keep the ancient fax for the increasingly rare times you use it and concentrate on finding one workhorse to do your printing, copying and scanning -- which is what yer mod-ren small business is all about.<br /><br />Those three jobs are handled with astonishing speed and grace on the D550. It sits on your desk, just a bit too high for my taste, causing you to either have to half stand up to view the 5-line control panel or, if you're a little crafty, position a business card-size pocket mirror on the ledge so you can see the printout without a stretch (yep, in reverse).<br /><br />To love: the beast goes from dead silent to first print in seven screamin' seconds. Really. So much fun you spend the first day or two just idly pressing print and counting mississippi's just to watch it again. Then one page per 2 secs without a shudder. Gorgeous.<br />Scanner works from your computer software -- straight-forward, pdf to desktop, just what the client ordered, so you can then attach it to an email and forsake ye ole fax machine.<br />Copier -- simple and flawless.<br /><br />Here's the other amazing fact: It likes manual feed. Show me another printer that can look you in the eye and say THAT. Copies are -- for the most part -- straight, error free, non-eaten, non-jiggered. There are real paper guides and you just push a sheet in and print.<br />And the paper try holds -- gasp -- half a ream. AND doesn't have to be pulled out and opened up to restock.

Moreover, the "new" toner cartridge runs out of toner much sooner than the older ones - probably by design.

It also sets up relatively simply, if a bit slow due to all of the lengthy installs and setup processes.<br /><br />Currently, those are my only positive comments.  This printer drains ink like mad.  Others have mentioned repeated 'clean cycles', I can't speak to that since I have it in another room and don't monitor it's every movement.  However, I can say that I only managed to get about 30 pages out of the ink that came with the printer.  Once the ink starts running low, it nags you incessantly to buy more ink.  Ultimately you can hit OK (on the printer only, no way to bypass from the computer) to continue printing, for a few more pages.  Once the ink runs out, YOU CANNOT USE THE PRINTER, SCANNER, or FAX for anything until you replace the ink.  The printer becomes a worthless beeping lump until you put a new ink cartridge in.  In my case, all 3 color inks ran out at the same time, costing me nearly $40 to replace them simply so I could use my printer again.<br /><br />Another complaint, "grayscale" is a joke.  No matter how many different options I tried, 'grayscale' would continue to print out pink (in my case, because blue and yellow were empty).  It hardly used any of the GREY INK THAT IS IN THE PRINTER, nor either of the two black inks.  So there I was, having THREE full black/grey ink cartridges in my printer, and I could only print in a healthy pink color until the ink was fully drained from the three color tanks and my printer became useless due to the complaint listed above.<br /><br />Thirdly, I bought a set of replacement color ink from Target, hoping to have a functional printer once again.  I made the mistake of buying the 221 ink instead of the 226.  I thought, no biggie, I'll try it anyway.  The ink carts were the same exact size, same plastic clip holding it in place, same size and positioning of the ink nozzle on the bottom, and same size, shape, and contact points on the microchip glued to the front.  What could go wrong?  Plenty, "wrong ink cartridge installed" was the only response.  Why?  Because canon says so.  Just as a test, I simply swapped out the microchips.  I took the chip from the 226 ink, and placed it onto the 221 ink.  Previously the 221 ink reported 'wrong ink cartridge', now it is reporting 'out of ink', miraculously just like the 226 ink that was just replaced.  Thus, the cartridges (or printer) are programmed with a set number of prints, not actual ink level.  Multiple sources out there say you can swap the chips and reset the printer's counter so you can use a third party ink cartridge.  You can't use canon's ink monitoring system that way, but considering it's a complete fabrication anyway, it doesn't particularly matter.  I plan to use ink other than canon's from now on, potentially getting a new printer entirely for this complete breach of customer trust.<br /><br />All in all, it is quite clear that Canon makes good printers.  Just good enough to make you want to buy more and more and more ink.;;2.0;;July 4, 2012;;7;;9;;0.777778

Oh woe is me...<br /><br />1. The box only had 1/2 a power cord. After some time on the phone I was informed by HP support that they would ship me a new cord and I would receive it in 2 weeks. If that time frame was unacceptable to me I could pay for 2 day shipping at a cost of $27. Thanks but no thanks. I went to a Friend who repairs computers and he had a extra cord.<br /><br />2. After installing the program everything looked fine until my wife tried to print airline tickets in landscape format. So printing with IE or Acrobat reader in landscape causes the the printer to be "Jammed" even though no paper is actually jammed. The page just stops printing. Portrait format printed fine(for the most part see below). So I called HP support again. After about 2 hours of monkey around with them the last "tech" said my software was at fault and not the printer or its drivers and have a nice day. So I checked online for new HP software and found that there was a patch to fix some bugs. I was sorta surprised tech support never suggest that so I installed the patch and lo and behold I can now print landscape in Adobe acrobat but not IE. I am making progress here. So I downloaded Firefox and I can now print in landscape.<br /><br />3. I decided to print a doc with 4 pages on one page in portrait to save on paper and ink. After about six tries I finally got the document printed. I kept getting the document jammed but no paper actually jammed again. Which is sorta annoying because after you turn the power off and on it takes like 3-4 mins to re initialize.<br /><br />So the bottom line is I have this crappy printer that is not compatible with common programs like adobe acrobat or internet explorer. It jams all the time. It has crappy tech support and when it does print it is so loud it actually makes me cringe because I think it is going to blow up.<br /><br />I am taking it back this weekend. Have a nice day.;;1.0;;November 25, 2009;;17;;20;;0.85

Overall experience with the setup and use has been very good. Setup was very intuitive.<br />The styling is really sleek in comparison to the Cannon printer that I had before this one. You do suffer some issues due to this sleek styling. The little drawer at the bottom that you pull out to load paper becomes a real pain after a while. Mainly because there is no good handle on the front to grasp. Sometimes when you try to pull the drawer out, you accidentally trip the door above it (the one that opens when you are printing something).<br />The biggest problem that I have, which is also cause by styling, is that there is no easy way to grasp the upper portion of the printer. This is the one that you lift to place a document to be copied or scanned. There is a notch to lift it up but really no place to hold it as you are lowering it down. Therefore it usually crashes down. I actually took a 5" piece of aluminum and glued it into this notch area to provide an easy place to grip. It works very well.;;4.0;;June 15, 2010;;12;;13;;0.923077

Using the "draft" mode, pictures are acceptable, if a little 'pastel.'  Normal mode does a really good job with pix.  Text is very, very sharp and deep black (where asked for).  I love this little bargain.  If it dies in a year I'll rush right out to buy another one.<br />  Like the Gillette razors, they sell you the handle for cheap, and make the money on the blades (er...ink!).

I love this printer!!! I have printed school marketing posters with full photo quality and it looks as though we hired a professional. I am not sure what a previous reviewer was talking about not being able to get paper anymore because we can still get it right from the [...] website. It has a variety of media it can print on from regular heavy paper, glossy photo paper, and even Tyvek. We use the Tyvek for our outdoor signage. It isn't a "super" fast printer but I can't imagine anything printing in this large a format printing very fast anyway. We have had local professional photographers come in and want to see it and look at samples and now they are considering getting one!!! This is a great printer and I would recommend it to anyone professional or to anyone just wanting to print out large format pictures. The WOW factor will never go away!!!<br /><br />UPDATE: One of the previous reviewers talked about there being 12 ink cartridges to replace and although they are in fact correct about the 12 part they are not all actually cartridges. There are 6 cartridges: Cyan, Light Cyan, Magenta, Light Magenta, Yellow, and Black. This six ink system is what HP has switched to for any printer with photo quality output like its higher end Deskjets and most anything named Photojet. Although this sounds like a money making scheme to require more cartridges it is what some companies have been doing for years now and that is not requiring you to switch out a complete cartridge when only one color might be low. The other 6 "cartridges" are in fact print-heads that must be changed for each color as well. However, this is not required every time you change the ink but does make a great deal of difference in the quality of the printing if you don't change it when required. As far as I can tell from the system monitor it is every three or so cartridges however, I tend to think its based more on the amount of full page printing you do. We do a lot and we are no where near needing to change them yet. This is also becoming standard on these same 6 color printers as well because now with the 6 color cartridge it is no longer possible for the print cartridges to "travel" back and forth across the page with the cartridge chassis inside the printer. You know what I'm talking about the sound you could hear from most older printers was the sound of the ink cartridges and the ink-jets moving across the page. Now the ink is delivered in tiny tubes that allow only the six print-heads to move while the ink cartridges are stationary. So yes you must replace twelve different consumables but not at nearly the same rate as usual. There are monitors on the small LCD screen on the side of the printer and it will indicate the level of remaining ink in the cartridges and quality of the print-heads. Can't say enough good about this printer it is a sure bet.<br /><br />UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2009: As you can see from my previous post about this printer I was a huge fan. No doubt I still am a fan but with one word of caution now. About 3 months ago while printing a poster we were mid way through a roll when it must have caught the edge of the paper??? Well I canceled the job and pulled out the paper re-cut the edge and re"threaded" the paper roll. Since then about every three jobs it would align incorrectly after it cut the previous page and sometimes jam up again. I was annoyed but continued to use it and made an appointment with the local HP service office. When he showed up to look at it he couldn't figure it out, then he said it just might be some switches that help align the paper in the back where the roll comes in. He took it to his office and told us he would call when it was done. He called a few days later and said we were now the proud owners of a HP paper weight!!! He told us that he replaced everything he usually does with paper timing problems and then when that didn't work he called HP directly. They said it was on par with other users of the Designjet 130 after about 3 years and it means the roll feed system is no longer good. When he asked about replacing the roll feeder they said it was built into the printer and irreplaceable. They told him that they considered the Designjet to be like any other printer they have and it will reach the end of it usable life in a few years. WHAT!!! It has been two years and the printer costs 1200.00 Dollars!!! Ours was almost 2000.00 dollars since we bought the printer with the network card (designjet 130nr) Just beware all of you out there who are buying this with the thought that this printer is full of replaceable parts. This is like an expensive version of their normal deskjet printers and just like most of us wouldn't repair those we would just buy another, HP thinks you should do the same thing with this printer too.

It worked the first time and only took a few minutes.<br /><br />I also set it up on my Mac, and that was also simple - install the driver from the included CD, then add the printer via the Mac's preferences.<br /><br />Once it was set up, printing is really fast. Even if the printer was sleeping, it wakes in a couple of seconds and prints nearly instantly. Print quality is fine and I love the duplex (2-sided) printing (and of course I love that this printer works as a network printer - it means I can print from any computer in my house without having to leave one computer turned on all the time).<br /><br />Only a couple of really minor gripes: First, I hate the glossy black surface since I know it'll show dust and fingerprints. Second, even though the printer's web setup shows a setting to turn duplex on/off, that setting is ignored when you print; it seems that the duplex setting that counts is the one in whatever software you're using to print.<br /><br />P.S. I haven't noticed any unusual noise as some others have reported. It seems to make the same amount of noise as most other printers I've used.;;4.0;;January 13, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

I have a mac notebook with snow leopard and an iMac desktop also with snow leopard.  I use the Time Capsule as my wireless router/back up storage device.  I was able to connect both my laptop and desktop mac computers to the printer wirelessly without any problems.  I simply installed the disk on both computers and the rest was easy.  Set up was less than 20 minutes.<br />Please keep in mind I have had the printer for two days but so far so good.  The price right now is unbeatable.  There have been a lot of questions about scanning wirelessly.  I was able to scan both from my iMac and macbook without any problems.  You just have to use the program preview which is on your mac computers anyway.  The duplex printing is great.  My wife and I also have iphones so there is an epson picture app and another app called printJinni that allows you to print documents, pdfs etc.  Both of these apps work great.  If you have any additional questions the EPSON online website will have the answer.  Overall very happy.  The only negative comment I would have is the unit itself is kind of big.  This printer is bigger than my old one but the paper trey goes right into the unit so you do not see it.  It is sleek and looks nice but it is big.  I do not have the Epson paper so the print quality looks ok but not overwhelmingly impressive.  I cannot make any comments on the picture print quality since I will not be using this feature.

The print quality of the color laser is respectable, though slow to print in color.  Black and white speed was what I would consider typical.  The slower color print speed is part of the trade-off of a single drum unit, but for my own use, I did not mind.<br /><br />Scanning/copy quality overall was decent.  I have a use case where I wanted the unit to scan and save directly to a Windows share on a wireless network, which it handled well when it was connected.  However, if the unit was powered off or I came back an hour or two later, it would lose the ability to see the network share unless I connected to the printer again from my computer.  This was the first show stopper for me, but may not be for most.<br /><br />The one issue that many may find, and was tough to dig out without hands-on use, was the way this unit handles power consumption.  When idle, it hovers around 10watts of use, which is great.  However, as this is a laser printer, it regularly needs to heat up the innards which is a major power draw.  While Samsung states "average 350w power consumption", this is very much a stretch.  Every minute or so, the unit's power draw spikes up to 850watts (~7amps) for a couple of seconds to the point that the lights flicker regularly, and this impacts any other electrical devices on the circuit (to the point a computer UPS will kick on to protect).  This can cause unreasonable wear and tear on other electrical devices, and is inconsistent with most of modern laser printers that level off overall power consumption better.  The only way around this is to put it on its own circuit, which for many may be a deal breaker for many.  In comparison, an HP laser atypically runs much more evenly, as does the Brother (though the Brother's overall power consumption is much higher).<br /><br />I wanted to like the unit, and it did have many nice features, but the major engineering short sightedness of not isolating power better with a larger capacitor set in the power supply shifted the cost of ownership from the unit itself to the necessity of hiring an electrician to run a new line.  This on top of the power draw (HP AIO I tested some time ago was around 650w peak, Brother AIO I tested more recently was around 630w peak) should be well understood before purchase.  The price reflects this design decision, but to be honest, I'd rather spend $20 more and get one that has this problem solved.<br /><br />Given the price point, its not a bad deal, but only if you have the right environment to support the unit.;;3.0;;June 25, 2011;;47;;50;;0.94

However, if you have Lion, you need to be relatively tech savvy to get this printer up and running on a wireless network; if you want to print wirelessly it won't be easy to set up.  Brother hasn't updated their setup wizard for this printer so the "easy" setup guide and software won't work for you.  You'll have to use a hodgepodge of driver patches and alternately connect and then disconnect the printer to your mac using a USB cable in order to get the job done.<br /><br />I'm not a tech professional, but I do know my way around computers and this was frustrating.  Took me a couple hours of trying different patches and methods.  First the installation CD told me that it wouldn't work for Lion, so I downloaded a bunch of software patches (the documentation of which seem to be written by and for tech professionals) from Brother's product website & tried a bunch of them, tried the apple autodetect software (didn't work), rebooted, consulted some help forums, rebooted again, then went back to the installation CD and found some utilities on there that helped (despite the fact that all the software on the CD was supposedly incompatible with Lion).  Then I finally got it up and running after fiddling with things for a while longer.<br /><br />Translation: not easy for Mac OS Lion users.

It prints, scans, copies and faxes quickly and flawlessly, including duplex (2-sided) printing and scanning.  The "DW" designation means it duplexes and works as both a wired and wirelss device on your network.  The wireless feature and duplex scanning capability account for the price being higher than a similar but less expensive Brother 8840DN, which doesn't have the wireless feature and doesn't scan duplex.<br /><br />The setup software works without a hitch, which was not the case with some of the earlier Brother MFC products I've owned.  It can scan into a PDF file and it has a USB port on the front so you can load files directly from a memory stick or a camera.  You can use a USB connection to your computer, a wired LAN (Ethernet) cable, or a wireless link to a Wi-Fi network. (If you have more than one computer, you'll find it easier to set them up if you use either a wired or wirless network connection.  Setting up multiple computers when the printer is connected to one computer with a USB cable can be a pain and sometimes just doesn't work at all.)<br /><br />I set it up using the wireless feature on a mixed network (two Windows 7, one Windows XP and a Mac laptop with OSX.  The printer found the Wi-Fi network and the setup software then asked for the security code (assuming you have set up a secure network).  Once that was done, all of the computers could be set up with the driver for their particular operating system. It's easiest setting multiple computers if you remember to write down the printer's IP address -- it will look something like 192.168.1.04 (or .05 or .06 etc.) and the software displays it after it's linked to the network in the first setup step.  But if you don't know an IP address from a pitchfork, just follow the instructions in the setup software.<br /><br />You will need to install a driver onto each computer.  That's the software that tells the computer how to talk to the printer.  Brother supplies CDs one CD for Windows 7, one for various recent Mac OS's and one for Windows Vista, XP and perhaps earlier versions. You have to do that because there are no built-in drivers for this relatively new model in older Windows versions, and even Windows 7 does not have a built-in driver for this particular model yet.  The setup instructions lead you through all of this clearly.  You don't need to install the whole package of scanning and optical character recognition software because there's an option to just choose the driver, but the MFC 8890DW does come with additional reasonably useful software.<br /><br />The printed instruction manual has a very detailed explanation of how to use the fax capability, but the instructions for scanning are not as complete and there's not much information about the various printing options.  The details are in a PDF file on the CDs that come with th printer, which seems strange given that Brother makes the effort to supply a printed manual in the first place.  Programming in the phone number and ID for your fax requires that you carefully follow the instructions in the printed manual, but they're clear enough.<br /><br />The instructions for printing envelopes tell you to open the rear exit tray you print on anything other than regaulr paper, but if you use a regular weight #10 envelope you don't need to open the rear exit tray.  The envelope will follow the normal paper path without jamming or getting messed up.  One small cloud is that the left rear hinge appears to be the same design as on an earlier model Brother MFC I have, and that hinge broke despite careful use.  Be extra gentle whenever you lift the scanner cover.<br /><br />Printer manufacturers make their profits on toner and ink, and Brother is no exception.  But they give you an option.  You can buy a replacement toner cartridge good for 3,000 "average" copies at a cost of about two and a half cents each, and that's what comes with the printer.  Or you can buy one for the 8890DW and some other recent models that gives you 8,000 copies for about 80% more, which gives you a cost of about a cent and a half.;;5.0;;October 23, 2010;;14;;14;;1.0

My only complaints are the price of ink and an issue where I tried to print black and white (text and a solid black graphic) onto a CD, and the printer refused to let me print because I was out of yellow ink.  The software (Epson Print CD) wouldn't let me choose to print in just black and white to avoid the error message.  This was very annoying, and sped up my replacement of the printer rather than the over priced ink.  All in all, still love this printer.;;5.0;;July 24, 2009;;25;;27;;0.925926

I checked the specifications, and it claimed it could do cardstock. However, it kept jamming on the cardstock. I went through the Epson website trouble shooting screens, and I discovered that the maximum paper weight it can handle is 24 pounds (that's the weight of fine office stationery). Cardstock is usually 50 or 60 pound weight.<br /><br />If I had discovered this earlier, I would have purchased a different printer. As it was, I think Epson made the specifications too vague, by specifying cardstock rather than the weight of usable paper.<br /><br />Addendum: In the troubleshooting section of the Epson website, it suggested that paper jam could be reduced by feeding sheets one at a time. I tried it, and the printer worked like a charm--smooth paper feeding and fast printing. The only drawback is that I must stand by the printer and feed each sheet of cardstock one at a time.<br /><br />I should mention that Epson, unlike many vendors, includes high-capacity ink cartridges in the box.<br /><br />Please consider this a four-star, not a three-star, review.;;3.0;;December 10, 2007;;84;;93;;0.903226

I am MORE than satisfied to date with its performance.  A number of reviews gave its ability to print pictures a poor rating, but if you adjust the printing preferences within the Brother printing programming from 600dpi to 2400dpi (prior to printing) the images look excellent.  The machine provides a very quick print from "sleep" - much faster than the OKI C3200n it replaced - and the toner is more affordable.  One big step up, in my opinion, is the duplexing that is built in...huge time saver.  Lastly, I set it up wirelessly.  The process was simple and straightforward.

Up to that point I was sold on Canon.  The Amazon.com reviews of the various printers  were extremely helpful, so I took the plunge.  I am now an Epson fan. It was very easy to set up and the size was similar to my old Canon. The 4 by 6 inch photos printed in approximately 20-25 seconds (as opposed to the 45 seconds it took the Canon)in the highest quality. The prints took approximately an hour to completely dry (As compared to the 2 hours for the Canon photos).  The inks were as advertised, smudge-proof and vibrant.  The quality of the prints from the Epson were slightly but noticeably better than the Canon i850. However, that could simply be a matter of personal taste.  When Epson advertises that their inks produce vibrant colors, it is as advertised.<br /><br />There were some negative comments that I had read prior to buying this printer regarding the need to replace the ink cartridges too often.  I felt that the Canon cartidges actually lasted quite a while, plus being a lot less expensive than the HP's (being a former HP color printer owner as well).  The Canon cartridges do still last a little longer than the Epson, but it's close. I printed approximately 350 4 by 6 inch photos in high quality and four 8.5 by 11 inch prints before having to change a single cartridge.  The speed of the Epson plus the quick drying time and quality of the prints more than makes up for the additional photos that the Canon cartridges produced.<br /><br />As to comments I read about the Epson being noisy.  Again, it may be a matter of perception, but I did not find it noisy at all.<br /><br />The only thing I have yet to try so far is their ability to print a label directly onto a CD.<br /><br />Additionally, I like the the support from Epson and the quick service (24 hours). When ordering replacement cartridges from Epson for 3 or more, the shipping is free. Plus they frequently have sales on printer accessories when you register the printer with Epson.  I liked this printer so much that I recommended it to a life-long HP printer advocate and she too agreed with my assessment after purchasing the same printer from Amazon.com.  The only test remaining is the test of time.;;5.0;;December 19, 2009;;6;;7;;0.857143

By way of background on me: I have been working in IT doing everything from Desktop/network support, UNIX sys admin, SAP Basis admin, security, etc since 1996, and have been into computers since 1980, so I have a bit of a background as a troubleshooter. Anyway, I spent most of the day on the phone with a canon support person, and at the end of it all they basically tried to blame my router - a netgear WGT624 v3. This router has worked flawlessly for years with every wireless device I have ever attached to it. Anyway, I kept messing with it after I hung up the phone with them, and finally got it to work on all four of my machines -- 2 Win 7 x64's, and 2 XP SP3's, again, no thanks to their tech support. Besides the horrific install, the printer is great. Good scanning, automatic duplexing, beautiful photo printing. Can't comment on ink use yet, since it is still too new.

My frustration started when I ran into the low toner, then replace toner messages. Once you get replace toner message, the machine will stop printing. After several calls to Brother support and long hours on wait, (and $400 spent on new toners) I was not given ANY satisfying answers. They explained thats the yield of the toners, yield my @ss, I only printed 200 color copies. I got frustrated to the point of wanting to return the MFC. Before I did I decided to google and see if I was the only crazy one, and sure of enough there are many people out there with the same frustrations. So I found a way to trick the machine and bypass (money hungry Brother) messages. Do this:<br /><br />1. With power on, open the toner access main door (You will get a "door open" message in the LCD.)<br />2. Hit the "Clear/Back" button and... ta-dah!!! you go right to the "Toner Reset Menu" (cue Vienna Boy's choir sounds here).<br />3.

First, the paper loads from the back and pops out the front. This is an old Canon design, i know, but it really messes with the aesthetics of the printer. I'd prefer that it load from the front.<br /><br />Second, it takes an agonizing  amount of time to start printing the first page, at least 20 sec. Each page prints in 10 sec or less once it starts, but it still takes a large pause between pages.<br /><br />I have a mac, and it will NOT allow manual duplexing. Come on, Canon, is that feature REALLY that hard to add? Now I have to print one page at a time, or over over my printer to feed new sheets of paper as they come out to achieve the same effect.<br /><br />The ink seems like it will go out quickly. My software tells me i'm already down to 3/4 on black, and I cant have printed more than 15-20 pages. The cartridge is 1/2 the size of a similarly priced Kodak cartridge for a similarly priced Wifi printer, the Kodak ESP 5250 All-in-One Printer which is cheaper at Walmart. My parents have it and it works great.<br /><br />Summary<br />I don't print that much, and rarely print pictures. Hopefully the economics of this printer works out for me for at lest the next 2 years that i'm likely to have this printer. I'd go for the printer with cheaper ink, though.;;3.0;;January 11, 2011;;6;;7;;0.857143

Most of my semi-pro work has been produced through well known national photo developers, which can offer price, customization, and quality (canvas, art papers, framing, etc). When I compare my current prints to previous prints, the personally controlled Epson Stylus 3880 prints surpass the national professional developer product in every case.<br /><br />I wish I had purchased an Epson Professional Imaging printer sooner. I chose the Stylus Pro 3880, because it has great proven features and an excellent target price in view of projected benefit. I gained immediate feedback and flexibility to produce my prints. I am so excited with the control I now have of the workflow and print output. The quality is excellent, what I hoped.<br /><br />Part of this control is selecting paper for the job or customer. Epson's Photo and Fine Art papers are excellent, and a wider range of professional papers are available. I have already used Epson's Ultra Presentation and Luster, and Signature Cold Press Bright, Exhibition Fiber papers, and Velvet Fine Art paper (my personal favorites). I couldn't be more pleased with the Epson Stylus Pro 3880. Excellent prices can be found if you search for paper.<br /><br />Epson's Hot Press Paper is wonderful. Wow! The output is excellent; I was fixed, persuaded, hooked, and sold on Luster and Ultra Matte, but Hot Press is, well unbelievably, great. I get fine gamut output on a truly superb paper. This paper does not disappoint. It is a smooth paper that comes in Natural and Bright, and 100 percent cotton. For matte I love warmth, this is excellent.<br /><br />Received and printed some of Hahnemuhle's Fine Art Bamboo. It is at 290 gsm with a warm natural tone and beautiful texture. Wow, with this tone, I can't say how wonderful suitable pictures turn out for print. It is incredible paper for warmth for your pro pictures. This paper feeds without a hitch in the 3880. Candidly, this Bamboo paper fascinates me; I just study the output, peruse it. My wife must think I am insane; I look at the output like that troll, "precious". Excellent paper and output. Download the ICC at the manufacturer's site.<br /><br />The Hahnemuhle papers are superb; I've used Photo Rag Smooth, Ultra Smooth, Pearl, and Bamboo; and I'm waiting to receive and try Baryta, Torchon, Durer, and Monet Canvas. Thus far, the output is tremendous.<br /><br />Monet Canvass, I am unable to get this canvas to feed, from the back or front. Baryta is amazing. The gamut is superb. I cannot compare Hahnemuhle Baryta at this point; it is singular.<br /><br />I am also waiting for some Bergger Paper.<br /><br />The most problematic topic that I have faced using the Epson 3880 is user defined paper size with 3rd party ICC profiles. It is hit and miss. Really, I haven't figured out a certain process that avoids repeated and repeated back feeder attempts. It is frustrating enough to "abandon the 13x19" for another easier size format. I am about to give up on this size format, just to avoid the time COST. EPSON please correct this problem of Epson Signature ICC profiles and 3rd party ICC profiles with user defined paper sizes.<br /><br />My only workaround is using a commensurate Epson Default Profile, when using Epson Signature or 3rd party papers, instead of some 3rd party ICC profiles. Part of the problem must be in a failure to recognize and change from photo to matte, or vice versa, black.<br /><br />Software setup is easy, and documentation is clear. I set my printer up on a network/router. I accomplished this in a few minutes, and was printing quickly, surprisingly fast.<br /><br />Printing From the Back Tray: There is some extra care when printing from the back Tray. At this point, my experience is that if you load paper in the back tray and push it into position before spooling there my be some delay, but if you spool and then load and push the paper down into position in the back tray, it continues seamlessly. This really is a small foible; just become familiar with the printer. If your back tray does not print, try turning the printer "off" and the paper will eject; then try again as mentioned supra.<br /><br />It seems if you press slightly on the papers edge to load, when the "load paper" LED is prompted, it will load every time. This seems to work regularly for me, when loading paper from the back tray. The exception seems to be 13x19 user defined when used with Epson Signature Profiles and 3rd party ICC profiles requiring a Black photo/matte change.<br /><br />The TUMI cover is great and I recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their investment protected from dust. It fits nicely and is a great product to protect your printer. Get it! To install your printer cover easily, start from the back at the back feeder tray and work to the front. If you start from the front, when the back tray is installed you may need to play with installation.<br /><br />I have been using Spyder 3 SSR 100 to make my workflow tight. Used this product for few weeks; The monitor calibration is excellent. I am getting very reliable monitor to print comparisons. I will share my thoughts on this pricy software in the coming days.<br /><br />After 6 (six) weeks of use I am very excited and anticipate additional great prints. Once one compares the reviews that the 4900 HDR Series is receiving, this may be the printer you want to get; unless you have a production workflow for the 4800 Series.<br /><br />After 8 (eight) weeks of use, I continue to output some great prints. I could not be more pleased; the only improvement would be in utilization of user defined 13x19 paper with Signature and 3rd Party ICC profiles. EPSON please correct this easy problem.;;5.0;;October 20, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

If you need a color laser at home for the occasional large volume printing, good color and print quality that won't break the bank (too much), this is the one to get.<br /><br />Using ink printers for color rich whole page prints can saturate normal print paper but with laser sheets remain crisp. Took about 15-20 minutes to do 100 duplex full page prints. one-sided prints go faster. 100 full page color took less than 10 minutes (letter size)<br /><br />output tray has to be cleared after about 50 prints or it starts to spill on floor. print output does not stack evenly (just in case you care about that).<br /><br />Toner very expensive. comes with 4 cartridges (3 color, 1 black) model TN-310. High capacity cartridge available (even more expensive) model TN-315. And fun fact, 4 new cartridges (one round of toner) cost almost as much as the printer itself, which also means that you never have to buy toner, just buy a new printer each time! (at the time my printer cost me $349.99, toner set was $339)<br /><br />Fortunately cartridges are refillable (but you didn't hear that from me). When the printer decides that any of the cartridges are empty (although they may not actually be), all printing stops (cannot even use black only). cartridge has to be replaced or reset (again, shhh...)<br /><br />if you're up to it, reuse cartridge (2 steps):<br />1. refill toner (search ebay or amazon for TN-310 or the TN-315 refill toner. can buy colors separately or in kits of 4. search youtube for instructions on how to refill.)<br />2. reset cartridge. they have a special gear on the side that needs to be turned to reset cartridge or printer will not accept it. it's called the 'flag gear' and you have to remove 3 screws to get to it. again check out youtube for directions. Another note about the 'flag gear', the 4 TN-310 cartridges that come with the printer do not have the 'flag gear' so you can either buy additional cartridges or you can buy the flag gear and install them yourselves. you will need 4 for the 4 cartridges. again, ebay/amazon to buy, installation instructions on youtube, can buy single or kit of 4.<br /><br />Please note that i'm obliged to say that you refill at your own risk and by no means encourage you to ('wink wink'). And also so doing may void your waranty with brother (not sure what their policy is but the don't recommend it), but then again if that happens, you could just buy a new one at the same cost they want you to pay through your nose for toner. refilling brings cost per print down from about $1.00 per page to about $0.30 (will vary greatly but whatever it is, it's significant)<br /><br />Printer also comes with a lot of connectivity options (Wired/Wireless Network, USB) and different methods for each. Manual can get a bit technical. Advice to non-tech persons, just follow the wizards on the installation cd. ignore the advanced setup features unless you have techie assistance.<br /><br />Gave 3 stars because my WiFi doesn't work. Printer freezes with error and needs to be turned off and on when i try to setup. Brother support seems to be ok. hopeful about getting it resolved but won't let it bother me if i don't. some people may not be ok with that.<br /><br />In summary, good printer but not practical for everyone, unless you are willing to get a little creative. make your choice. good luck.;;3.0;;September 3, 2012;;6;;6;;1.0

That printer gave me constant paper jams, even after trying various paper and thicknesses (you can see my review).<br /><br />In contrast, this Canon printer was and is everything I had hoped it would be.  No paper jams, excellent print quality, excellent photo quality printing (on National Geographic Glossy Photo Paper). Also the wireless setup went very smoothly and has worked flawlessly after having the printer for almost 2 weeks, although I do think the wireless on-screen setup could be a little more intuitive.<br />My other concern was using the printer with Linux Mint.  I have 4 computers networked... a Macbook Pro, 2 Windows PCs, and an Asus notebook that runs Linux Mint 13.  Obviously the Window and Mac machines installed the drivers and software without problems, and the software is quite good.<br />However for Linux, no drivers are included, and Canon has no Linux drivers for this printer listed on it's site.  Fortunately, I had researched this before ordering the printer, and found this site [...] which had driver.<br />The drivers work fine, so the printer is working great with Windows, Mac, and Linux... just so everyone knows.<br /><br />Bottom line... printer works great, and no problems with setup on multiple platforms.  Oh, and Google's Cloud Print works fine after a firmware update.;;5.0;;July 22, 2012;;6;;6;;1.0

I was more interested in getting a wireless printer that supported AirPrint for iPhones/iPads (had to install a firmware upgrade to get that, but that was very easy and it worked.)<br /><br />SO far everything about this printer works as advertised. It fits our needs as far as print quality is concerned, color and otherwise, and prints quickly and quietly. Being able to print wirelessly from iPhones and iPads with iOS 2 is very nice and i use that capability more often than I thought I would.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY, this bad boy tends to drop off the network after awhile, probably after it goes into sleep mode. It apparently doesn't awaken gracefully. I went looking for a fix and was sort of amazed to find this one recommended by HP: "Go over to the printer, turn it off then back on." Yes, it works, but it's sort of like telling me that if my faucet leaks, just go outside and pull a bucket up from the well. We've used it since Christmas but if this isn't fixed by a firmware update from HP before end of January, I'll be taking it back.<br /><br />SO if you bought this one for its wireless printing capability, watch out and test it aggressively for the first couple of weeks. And maybe keep the packing material if you bought it online.;;3.0;;January 7, 2011;;16;;16;;1.0

I got it to replace an aging OfficeJet that never played well on a Windows 7 home network. I followed the on-screen instructions and got the Photosmart B210 on the wireless network in a few minutes. I then downloaded the latest software (there's also a CD) on our three computers and had them all printing and scanning in about 15 minutes total. Everything worked, and I never had to refer to the printed setup instructions. Absolutely anyone should be able to get this up and running on a network in no time.<br /><br />The B210 was an impulse purchase at a big box store, and my wife was... upset with me for not consulting her. She began to come around when I told her she could put it anywhere in the house, no wires needed. And then she printed some pictures, and they printed faster and looked better than pics from the old printer. And it's quieter. So by the end of the day she came around and said she's happy with it.<br /><br />The ePrint feature (mailing a document or image to your printer) works as advertised and is easy to set up. This isn't a feature I expect to use, but it would be nice for owners of iPads and smart phones. The only feature we lost is Fax, but we haven't sent one in years.;;5.0;;September 30, 2010;;8;;9;;0.888889

The setup was relatively easy on a Mac, but there were some problems using Lion (see below).  I like the fax, scan, copy, and print features.  The printer doesn't do color, but the quality is what you'd expect from a Laserjet.  The network setup was quick and easy and there is both an ethernet connection and WiFi.  The printer is also AirPrint enabled, which is nice if you want to print from your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.<br /><br />This printer replaced my Photosmart printer because I never print photos and I print so infrequently that my ink dries up.  I elected to go with a laser because the toner won't dry from disuse.<br /><br />Setting up was easy.  You still have to use the CD when installing on a Mac (the Smart Install feature is for Windows users only), but it wasn't a problem.  You can either set it up via a USB cable or over the network.  The problems I had were installing the software and configuring the fax settings while using OS X version 10.7.1 (Lion).  Halfway through the installation, you get a text box that says you must have admin rights to install the printer (I'm logged in as an admin on my Macbook).  I called HP and they said that it's a known issue with Lion.  I used another computer (running Snow Leopard) to set up the fax settings and do the initial install with no issues.  I was still able to set up the printer to both print and fax (but not scan) from the Macbook running Lion (just go to your Print & Scan menu in System Prefs).<br /><br />Pros - Networked all-in-one with Fax, Scan, Copy and Print capabilities.  It's a Laser, so the quality is great and the toner doesn't "dry out."  AirPrint is awesome!  The printer also goes to "sleep" after 15 min for energy savings, but this is transparent to the user as it wakes up once you try to print to it.  It also supports ePrint which is HPs networked solution to log in and print to your printer from anywhere in the world.  Document feeder holds plenty of paper and will collate copies.<br /><br />Cons - It's a laser, so the toner is expensive (almost $50/cartridge).  No color.  Issues with Lion.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with the printer and its network functions, especially AirPrint.  Recommend.;;4.0;;August 25, 2011;;11;;11;;1.0

I have not used the fax application for this device because I have an older Brother fax/copier/scanner (non-networked) which is still going strong. Also haven't tried the duplex function.<br /><br />This machine is used in a small office and normally has only one user, me using Win 7.  I generally agree with most of the positive reviews I have read on Amazon about the functionality of the machine, it prints well, the scanning is good once you get the settings set up the way you want.  Noise and print speed is about the same for the Lexmark T520 it was replacing. It sits silently in sleep mode most of the time. Warm up time seems a little better than the machine it was replacing.  Cost was reasonable.<br /><br />However I was looking for a wireless laser printer, and the wireless function essentially does not work.  I have a wireless Epson Workforce 610 inkjet printer at home which works great, stuck off in an corner of the house and I was hoping to do the same with the MFC 7860DW at the office.  I spent several hours trying to make it work, much of it with level 2 tech support from Brother.  You know that stereotypical snotty IT guy that treats everyone like they are an idiot?  That's who I was talking too. (The first level of support folks were very nice, just not able to solve the problem).  He spent an inordinate amount of time duplicating all the stuff that had been previously done and lecturing me about me how much "better" the machine would work wired into the network. It wasn't a question of "better."  It was a question of it does work wired and does not work wireless. So now its wired.<br /><br />I have since read some reviews that suggest that there are some undocumented settings between Win 7 and the MFC 7860DW which can be adjusted to make the wireless work.  I have also seen other reviews that suggest that when in wireless mode the printer doesn't go into deep sleep.  At best this makes the MFC 7860DW have some limited wireless functionality. But now its set up and wired and I don't have time to mess with it.  Bottom line--if wireless is one of your primary considerations, choose another printer.;;3.0;;August 12, 2011;;8;;9;;0.888889

The problem is that this printer CANNOT wake up from sleep mode.  If you try to send it a print job after it goes into sleep mode, the print job will just time out because it cannot find the printer while it is asleep and it can't wake the printer.  As shown in Kodak's own troubleshooting guide, the only way to wake up the printer is to walk to the printer location to manually turn the power off then turn it back on again.  Once the printer restarts itself it will work fine -- until the next time it does to sleep.<br /><br />The latest firmware update finally gives you a way to choose how long the printer can be idle before it puts itself to sleep -- but the choices only range from 1 hour to a maximum of 4 hours -- there is no way to turn this "feature" off.<br /><br />I've got the Kodak Office Hero 6.1 but Kodak tech support assures me that ALL Kodak all-in-one printers share one major firmware flaw -- none of their printers can wake up from "sleep" mode without being manually reset from the printer control panel.<br /><br />This is fine for a local printer where the power button is within arm's reach of the computer but it makes the printer nearly useless as a network printer and totally useless for cloud printing unless you keep sending new print jobs to the printer to keep it from going to sleep.<br /><br />Instead of calling it sleep mode, a better name would be "coma" mode or perhaps "brain dead" mode.;;2.0;;March 15, 2012;;20;;21;;0.952381

The only things that went wrong for me was the first unit I received only printed on half the page no matter what I did, HP had me send it back to Amazon (super easy returns with Amazon!!). What I did learn from the first unit was that the HP toolbox software that comes on the provided disc lags and freezes my computer plus the drivers from the website don't install. Second time around I customized the installation of the drivers so the HP Toolbox util didn't install and all is GREAT.<br /><br />When I spoke with HP tech support they informed me that alot of people were having problems with the manual feed.

I can see room for improvement here though.<br /><br />In all, I would have to say this is a good purchase. Also, I don't want to poke at other reviewers but the 1320 was not designed to be a replacement for a Laserjet 2xxx series.

Software installs easily, though it takes a while.  Print quality is great, as is the scanner.  Scanning software is fair, has lots of options, but the auto scan function, which usually produces the best results, won't let you adjust the scan margins.  I've never had a scanner that auto-detected the paper margins correctly, so I won't ding the Canon on that issue, but the inability to adjust the margins on the auto-scan is ridiculous, forcing you into the very capable, but ultimately more time consuming, manual scan process for just about every scan from the glass.  ADF scans of 8.5 x 11 sheets work fine.<br /><br />However, the biggest failure of this printer is the duplex printing.  The printing is automatically lightened - printed with less ink - and the results are unacceptable where a quality print is needed.  This is not adjustable.  Canon tech support says this is done to protect the internal rollers of the printer from picking up ink and depositing it on the next sheet.  Why couldn't they just adjust the dry time?  This hasn't been an issue on any other inkjet printer I've had.  Manual duplexing doesn't work - page 2 doesn't wind up on the back of page 1 if more than two sheets are needed.  Canon's answer was to print even and then odd pages, but of course this won't work either if you need multiple copies and the document contains an odd number of pages.  In other words, duplexing is a FAIL on this printer.;;1.0;;September 14, 2011;;37;;42;;0.880952

I bought this printer first and then read the reviews. The low reviews scared me, but now that I've used the printer, I know that the low reviews are because the users didn't know how to set up the computer. Listen, it's an easy set up process. It takes about 20 minutes, but it's easy. Just follow the tablet instructions & videos. Another complaint from some was there was not a manual. Well, you can download it on the HP site. It explains everything! I think it rather funny that the people who complained about no manual didn't even think to read all the literature you can download from the HP web site. Nothing electronic anymore comes with a priinted manual. Manuals are all on pdf files now a days. I think the manual is also available on the CD.  If you're having trouble, at least go to the HP web site. There are steps there to walk you through set up and everything, if you you really want print.<br />When you register at HP there is all kinds of support. There is a FAQ list. A "How To" list. And even, a very short list of problems and how to fix those. HP has listened to their customers and have addressed them. And, no I don't work for HP. Like I said, i was ready to send this back until I did the research, so I want to dispel the myths from the low reviewers.<br />This is a great home station! I have printed an email from work with Adobe & Word attachments with no problem. The attachements came out perfectly formatted.<br />I have sent pictures through eprint from my cell phone email. The photo quality is AWESOME! Brilliant & vibrant colors.<br />The tablet (Zeen) is basically a Nook with loads of extras. The touch is sensitive, but it's a learning curve. It's an android tablet, so you can download some other apps, I'm told. And you can take it with you to a wireless cafe & browse your email, the internet, facebook, read an ebook, whatever, and then email what you like to your printer at home. It's not an IPAD or a Zoom, so don't think of it like that. If you think of it as a super cool Nook reader with extras, you'll love it. Hey, you're getting a cool basic tablet pc and a wireless printer for a great price. I don't think you can print wirelessly from those pricey tablets.<br />This printer is for home use so a dedicated fax line isn't necessary unless you fax tons. I occassionally fax, so the EFAX 20 free faxes per month is great for me.<br />It takes time to learn all that the printer and Zeen can do. Just be patient and you'll love this. Oh, and if the tablet is not attached to the printer, you still have print, copy, and scan functions available to you.<br />The SD card slot on the tablet can be used to read all your SD cards and send stuff to the printer or just listen to music, watch videos, and view photos directly from the card.

I was looking for a laserjet vs. inkjet, required wireless networking support, a decent sized paper input tray, (ideally a full ream, but negotiable), and of course, it had to be multi-function.<br /><br />I purchased this one as a Christmas gift, and have had it setup & running for a few days now.  Setup was very easy and took less than 15 minutes.  It found my wireless network and I was able to configure it easily.  I did get momentarily confused during setup as the process directed you to update the firmware to get the latest/greatest functionality and to enable ePrint.  But the printer wasn't listed in the printers supporting ePrint, which led me to a brief online chat session with HP's support.  Essentially they directed me to ignore that step, and I was able to confirm that ePrinting was functional, (the ePrint logo on the control panel clearly indicates the printer supports ePrint - so the website is simply behind).  There was a step in the setup process where I had to connect the printer via the USB cable, but that was removed in a later step, and the printer's functioning flawlessly on my wireless network now.  I've updated a couple of laptops to add the printer, (via the control panel process, and pulling the driver off the internet using the Windows Update option during printer setup).<br /><br />The ePrint setup was extremely easy as well - the printer generates a unique printer code, which it prints for you. You type in the code on the ePrint website and select a unique email address for your printer and you're done. I didn't read the fine print regarding how HP deals with any sensitive documents you send through their yyy@hpeprint.com domain, but I don't anticipate using it for sensitive information anyway.  You'll want to research that before sending anything really sensitive.<br /><br />So far, I've been extremely pleased with the printer.  It prints quickly, even when it's in sleep mode.  I informally timed it, using the second hand of the Windows clock, and within 45 seconds of sending a 7 page newsletter-type document, (light graphics & text on every page), it was printing the first page, and the entire document was done about a minute later.<br /><br />Copying is extremely easy, via the two front-panel buttons, (one for color, one for black & white).  I haven't tried a multi-page job yet, but the document feeder works fine.  The lid has a tendency to slam down when you're copying off-sized documents manually.<br /><br />Scanning is great as well.  The default install has an HP supplied product that will scan documents and import into PDF format or JPG formats.  Multi-page support is included and is a breeze to operate.  You can email or save as files directly from the interface.  The purchase also includes a fully-functional version of Readiris Pro 12.  This is a fully-functional OCR product that will save as MS Office formats as well.  I've only tried Word thus far, and it was klunkier than I'd expected.  The document was scanned in and saved as a Word doc, but when I attempted to open via Word I received several error messages about the file being corrupt prior to successfully opening the document.  I'm not sure what happened there, as the error messages led me to believe it wouldn't work. Yet it did, so ... it bears some more watching.  For my needs, the basic HP scanning product will probably be sufficient.  If I use the Readiris software more, I'll update the review with any new observations.<br /><br />And finally, it's nice that the printer's wireless, which means anyone can initiate scanning session without having to login to the "scanner pc" or whatever.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this printer to others, based on my usage thus far.;;5.0;;December 30, 2011;;12;;12;;1.0

I bought a Brother MFC7840W which for various reasons I returned, and I will explain all of that below.<br /><br />First, the things I like about this printer.<br />-  It is quiet.  The Brother had a very loud fan which ran just about all the time.  I do not even think the Canon has a fan.  It has a hibernate mode which pulls 3 watts of electricity, which is quite good.  By default it goes into sleep mode in 5 minutes.<br />-  The Brother dimmed the lights when it worked, the Canon does not.<br />-  The display is easy to read at any hight, the Brother required you to be about 5-4 to read it and I am 6-2.  I had to squat.<br />-  The pages come out only slightly distorted, better than the Brother, but not as good as the 10 year old HP I am getting rid of.  Then again, the $5000 HP printer we have at work distorts the paper about the same.<br />-  Paper feeding and duplex mode work fine and that is a nice feature.<br />-  Less flimsy than the Brother but I have to admit I paid almost twice as much.<br />-  Controls are reasonably easy to use, scan and fax are not difficult.<br /><br />Things I do not like:<br />-  Software is rough and not especially pleasant to use, the Brother was better in that regard.  No way to control the machine from the computer (other than scanning) unless you do so through the network.  I do have a home network but I have the machine connected with USB, so the web-based control program cannot be used.<br />-  There is an issue with paper alignment that some have mentioned, the Brother did not have this problem.  Sure enough, it is not exactly parallel with the edge but this can be fine tuned by shifting the paper in the tray and worst case, a strip or two of tape in the right place would shift the paper supply and fix that problem.<br />-  Even though it is not too flimsy, the paper tray is, and it is bothersome.<br />-  Some paper distortion<br />-  I have been able to use the fax in bound and out, but I am unable to set it up and have it co-exist with my answering machine which is what I wouuld really like.  According to the directions, this can be done, but you have to hang the answer machine off the printer which is not especially convenient.<br /><br />Overall I would say a machine like this is doing a lot, and there are a lot of potential down sides.  Compromises have to be made.  All things considered I like this unit a lot and even considering the extra cost I am glad I bought it.;;4.0;;April 21, 2009;;14;;14;;1.0

Unfortunately, despite having successfully at least 4 other non-computer devices to my wireless network in the past year or so, I was unable to get this printer connected.<br /><br />To do the wireless setup, you're supposed to first connect the printer using either a USB cable or a network cable. I tried it both ways, but although setup said that the printer (sometimes) detected my wireless network, it never successfully connected to it; the diagnostics always either said I had the wrong wireless security type, or that the network couldn't be connected. Well, I tried changing my WiFi setup to about 4 different types of security and no luck.<br /><br />Just for fun I also tried configuring the printer through its web interface; although I could (sometimes) reach the printer that way, and could fiddle with the wireless settings there too, once again, no luck connecting.<br /><br />I think I attempted to set up the printer on my Wi-Fi about 8 times, each time trying something a little different, before I decided to throw in the towel and send it back. I figured I had tried enough different things that calling support would be a waste of time.<br /><br />The only other item worth noting is that when the printer was warming up and preparing to print, the lights in the room dimmed briefly, so it's obviously sucking a lot of power occasionally. This didn't happen with my old laser printer, or with the new one I eventually got after returning this dud.;;1.0;;January 13, 2011;;25;;33;;0.757576

In normal gives you some kind of reverse banding with overlapping ink creating regular darker lines.(experience with 5 of them) But best mode is fairly fast and nice quality.<br />THE BIG PROBLEM OF THIS PRINTER IS PAPER HANDLING. If you print on letter size text paper or even 80# postcard / cover paper the printer is ejecting the pieces mostly in normal fashion. The best part comes when you are trying to print on Tabloid size paper or better Glossy Tabloid size paper. Printer is not able to eject the heavy piece of paper after finishing of the print.<br />The small tiny metal rollers located on exit side of the printer (just after the space where the print head is moving) have no grip on #100 heavy paper (and "0" - grip on glossy heavy paper) and are just sliding on the surface.<br /><br />In effect if you do not remove the piece in the right moment the printer is sucking the paper back / sideways pressing on the edge of the next coming piece of paper and damaging the edge. After you remove the paper Next print is just about 2" piece of image ( wasted piece of paper) THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE WITH 5 pieces of this OfficeJet 7000. Since I had the warranty from Office Max having problem I simply replaced the printer. The last one I replaced had IDENTICAL HANDLING PAPER STYLE / ISSUES like the new one I brought home.<br />I called the HP support and after 2 days of disconnected phones and learning how to understand people in India finally I was taking to somebody who promised to send me REFURBISHED REPLACEMENT. I declined since it doesn't solve the issue. Exactly same printer with exactly same paper handling mechanism is going give me exactly same problem.<br />Few days ago to my amazement I got another call from HP where nice girl (without Indian Accent) offered to send me as replacement<br />hp Photosmart B8550 photo printer.  I checked this new printer on display in local Microcenter and it has exactly same paper handling mechanism. (This is just better version of the 7000 model) So I am going decline. This is going be same story - new printer same paper handling problem.<br />Since there is no other comparable printer with 4 inks tabloid size on the market I think I am going try to glue to the tiny metal wheels some TINE PIECES OF STYREFOAM covered in rubber glue. It should increase the grip and hopefully solve the problem.<br /><br />Is quite apparent that HP never actually fully tested their product before releasing. They should replace the metal wheels with rubber rollers.;;2.0;;July 29, 2010;;14;;14;;1.0

The scanner decides on its own what dimensions it's going to scan, and there's no way to alter it's determination.

As a retired computer professional, one of my pet peeves is people who don't read the manual and then complain about something not working correctly.  After installing my new MG5220 it is obvious that some of the criticisms in the 1 and 2 star reviews were clearly cases of someone not reading the manual rather than anything wrong with the printer.  One example is the reviewer who complained that the printer required a USB cable with the flat connectors on both ends.  That's not true - it uses the standard USB cable with the flat connector on one end and the six-sided "square" connector on the other.  If he was trying to use the cable he described then he was trying to connect the printer to his computer using the USB input for connection to digital cameras and thumb drives.<br />But, there is one feature of this printer that I wish I had known about ahead of time.  The printer this is replacing had two paper feeds - the standard rear opening and a cassette.  I always kept 4x6 photo paper in the cassette and used the rear feed for whatever kind of paper I needed at the time.  The MG 5520 also has rear and cassette feed but the cassette will not hold 4x6 photo paper.  The slides that adjust for the paper will not close down to 4x6.  The manual recommends using the cassette for plain paper and the rear feed for photo paper.  This means pulling out and reloading the cassette every time you want to use a different kind of paper instead of just slipping a sheet in the rear slot.  For the way I use my printer, this is very inconvenient.;;4.0;;May 9, 2011;;13;;13;;1.0

I love the duplexing on this unit and the ability to print 2 & 4 up. My main complaint about this printers is the manual feed function. Basically, I think the 1320 has some fundamental design flaws with regard to manual feeds. I can now do envelopes reliably with the method described below, but feeding standard letter-size paper is still an iffy proposition.<br /><br />The manual envelope feed work-around that I've kludged together is the following:<br /><br />1) take the regular paper tray out slightly (2-3 inches) so it does not feed from there<br /><br />2) have the paper path go straight-thru<br /><br />3) adjust the manual feed guide to fit the envelope<br /><br />4) send the print job to the printer, and wait for the yellow indicator light to blink before putting in the envelope (feeding the envelope earlier seems to not work);;3.0;;December 10, 2004;;95;;100;;0.95
R12B4J34388Z7Z;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1SENCN3QG7KTE;;Printer;;B0020CL9VK;;Brother MFC-8890DW High-Performance All-in-One Laser Printer;;A truly exceptional device;;I was shopping around for all-in-one printer, to replace an old HP DeskJet 6127 Color Printer inkjet printer and an even older HP LaserJet 6p. I wanted an all-in-one with fax, print, copy, scan and built-in duplex with networking support for scan to PC and fax from PC. For some reason, the HP inkjet AIO printers do not support faxing from the PC (their laser printers do, but not the inkjet printers). They also are pretty horribly reviewed. So, even though I generally love HP printers, they were ruled out.<br /><br />After a lot of research, I selected the Epson Artisan 810 All-In-One Printer. Set it up, connected it, and started doing some test prints. The quality was pretty awful compared to my ancient HP Deskjet, using the same paper. We decided to send it back, because we just couldn't put up with that bad text and dim image quality.<br /><br />After some more thinking, I decided to keep the old inkjet for my color printing needs, and get a black & white laser multifunction printer. The Brother MFC-8890DW fit the bill, at a not unreasonable price. I was able to read all of the manuals at the Brother website and be certain that it could do everything I wanted. We especially liked the ability to copy, scan and fax from double-sided originals via the automatic document feeder - a lot of duplex devices only support duplex for output, not input. Additionally, the ability to work with legal-sized media was a bonus, as I'm going to law school next fall.<br /><br />When the device arrive, I noticed a very nice, thoughtful thing Brother had done. When you open the boxes of most components, there are little diagrams telling you how to unpack the device. Brother, on the other hand, included instructions on how to re-pack the device. Since we tend to keep packing materials and reuse them when we move, this was a very nice touch.<br /><br />The setup instructions were very clear, with step-by-step instructions for USB, parallel, wired and wireless networking setup split out, as well as Windows and MacOS software installations split out. There are also detailed instructions on setting up your fax line, depending on what other devices you have on that phone line and other things like distinctive-ring. Setting up the device was absolutely trivial - everything worked exactly as shown in the manual. The most complicated part of the setup was keying in my WPA-PSK code, which uses a mix of upper- and lower-case letters and symbols. Input is via a form of multi-tap input, which is probably trivial for texting young folk, but I prefer alphanumeric keypads. But it worked right the first time.<br /><br />Software installation on Windows XP SP3 was also straightforward. The CD that comes with the device has support up to Vista, but there are Windows 7 drivers and a complete software package on the Brother website. The Brother Status Monitor application started up and asked if I wanted to monitor for firmware updates, which I did. It immediately found an update and took me to the Brother support site to download it. Installing the update went completely smoothly. The device beeps a lot while the update is in progress, but that's the only annoyance.<br /><br />Another nice thing Brother does is to support testing your fax configuration by faxing back your registration form. After you fax it to them, you will receive a fax confirmation back from them. No need to go bother a friend to test your fax. Nice touch.<br /><br />The printer is blazingly fast, even with duplex printing. The quality is quite good, but not the very best I've ever seen. There's a HQ 1200dpi mode available, which shows marked improvement on printed images. I've use dedicated HP laser printers for the last couple of decades, and they have better print quality. But the Brother's output is excellent.<br /><br />Every feature I've tested works perfectly - print, copy, fax, scan, fax from PC, scan to PC, etc. We're using this at home, but it has a lot of features that are useful for a small office, including various network, security and remote management features.<br /><br />This is an all-around excellent device, an absolute bargain. I give it my unqualified recommendation.;;5.0;;December 20, 2009;;50;;51;;0.980392

They said the drum must be replaced by their technician. Translation: once the drum wears out, throw the printer away. However the lifespan of the drum is supposed to be 30,000 pages, according to Samsung. Chances are, it will last somewhat longer, unless they have a "replace drum" light, like Brother lasers have, that mean the printer will  simply stop working after a while.<br />There is toner to refill it yourself, but you have to reset the chip. The toner company I usually buy from recommends a new cartridge after reusing one three times, but new cartridges seem to come only filled, from what I've been able to find, and those are pricey enough that I would rather buy a new printer at $60 than buy the cartridge. I see a compatible cartridge for just a dollar less than you would pay for a new printer.<br />So these are some considerations when buying this printer. It would probably be an excellent deal for someone who isn't printing huge quantities. Or it might do for you to buy three or four of these printers at this price.;;3.0;;September 21, 2011;;31;;38;;0.815789

It does a great job on text and graphics and does a much better and quicker job on envelopes than any inkjet printer I have ever used.  The by-pass tray couldn't be easier to use.  Changing paper is easy because it is right up front and installation was a breeze.  Small, quick and quiet.<br /><br />(Updated in late February)  I wanted to speak to the review from the reviewer who said this printer requires a proprietary printer cable.  It doesn't.  It uses a standard USB A-B printer cable and supports USB 2.0.  No printers in this price range I am aware of are shipping with printer cables unless they are sold through club stores (Costco, Sam's Club, etc.)  It is also NOT true that it ships with a half full toner cartridge.  It ships with a full cartridge with the same amount of toner as the replacement cartridges.  One of its competitors (Samsung) in this price range does ship with a "short" cartridge and notes that on the box of their printer.<br /><br />I am still extremely happy with this printer it does more than I expected at this price.;;5.0;;November 1, 2005;;11;;11;;1.0

I unpacked the box, removed the plastic strips, scanned the quick start guide, plugged the printer in, and everything was great so far.  I then downloaded the newest drivers from the Brother website (drivers on included CD's are usually 3-12 month old) for my Windows 7 x64 and Windows 7 x32 laptops; executing the driver programs walks you through setup.  In the past for wireless products, I've found you usually have to first set them up on a wired (Ethernet or USB) connection, then change things over to wireless.  I decided to test the technological development level and go straight to wireless setup, starting with the 64-bit machine.  This consisted of inserting the tip of a pen [you could also use a paperclip, etc] into the wireless setup button hole, telling the printer to start looking for a router; then I ran downstairs, pushed/held the WPS button on my wireless router, telling it to start looking for another device - in one minute they met, and fell in love.  That was it.  The driver installation software (on the wireless 64-bit laptop) detected they had a successful partnership and moved on to the final screens.  Windows 7 had installed the printer with all of the advanced menus and controls.  I then installed the driver on the 32-bit laptop and it auto-detected the successful partnership without touching any hardware - very simple install and wireless printing was ready to go.<br /><br />I never bit with the wireless inkjet offerings, as the long term operating costs of inkjets are crazy.  I've been refilling the toner cartridges on laser printers for years, running them for so cheap it's amazing.  If this unit just had laser printing and reliable wireless it would be a fantastic deal.  However, it has many features which are totally surprising. This review is already too long so I'll just say that the auto duplexing is great.  What is even cooler is the Booklet feature.  I'm holding in my hand a 20-page PDF that I selected "Booklet" in the options while printing.  It printed on both sides of the paper, reduced the pages to half-sheets, arranged the pages in the precise/complicated order, and output tiny stack of FIVE sheets (from 20).  I folded the stack in half and viola - a perfect booklet that is more convenient to travel with and uses one-quarter of the paper!  I'm not sure you can know how cool this is until you actually have a booklet in your hand - so buy this machine now and see for yourself.<br /><br />One final caution, the supplier I normally order bulk toner from does not yet have the formulation for this printer.  I'm sure they will in time, but for now you might actually have to buy the TN450 replacement cartridge which runs at roughly 2.2 cents per page, once the 700-page starter cartridge is exhausted.<br /><br />I've only had this printer for a few days, so hopefully it lives up to my current expectations and retains its 5-star rating.  To be honest, these things are going for less than a hundred (on sale + coupon, at office supply stores) and at that price point just straight laser printing with wireless is a great deal.;;5.0;;November 15, 2010;;154;;159;;0.968553

I have another Canon printer that I just love, because it never clogs, always works no matter how much time there is between prints. This new printer is every bit as good, and even better. It has almost perfect registration; that is, the paper aligns precisely as it should, with no annoying offset to one side or the other.<br /><br />When doing borderless printing, there is also near-perfect registration of the printed image, so that you don't have to set it for a big enlargement to ensure that the entire area of the paper is covered. I am real happy about this as I hate to waste ink. I don't yet know how frugal this printer is with its ink; other reviewers have spoken about that. It DOES make quite a racket when it first grabs the paper, but that's no big deal to me. I have put three different sizes of photo paper (4x6, 8.5x11, 13x19) and two different sizes of plain paper (8.5x11, 11x17) through it and it handles them all without the slightest problem.<br /><br />Be aware that this printer uses dye-based inks and therefore the printed surface isn't as durable as pigment-based inks. On the other hand, the inks are cheaper and provide more vivid colors.

I have always loved them and found them to be extremely reliable UNTIL NOW.  I replaced an existing HP 6100 series printer with this new C410 series.  The old printer still works although it is wearing out.  The new printer simply will not communicate with my Dell PC.  The trouble shooting dept at HP tells me it's my computer even though the old printer still works fine to this day.<br /><br />When I do call for help I end up spending an hour on the phone each time I call repeating the model #, Serial # and product code.  After 4 calls, I know they have this in their computer system.  The last time I called, I asked to speak with a supervisor and was put on hold.  After 5 minutes, the same gentleman came back and asked me the same questions.  I again asked to speak w/a supervisor was put on hold again and after holding the second time, the same gentleman came back again asking the same questions.  After repeating this procedure 4 times, I finally gave up and hung up.  I have over 5 hours on the phone with HP trying to get this working properly and it is still not right.  Printers should be "plug and play" ................. Unbelievable;;1.0;;March 29, 2011;;4;;5;;0.8

I'm using this printer to create greeting cards and am only printing the greeting and the back of the card - no pictures.  The one time I did try to print a photograph it printed half of it fine and the rest of it was totally dull and missing colors!<br />I have dealt with extremely poor print quality and today was the icing on the cake with ink smearing all over the expensive stock.<br />Tech support, obviously not from around here, were as automatedly helpful as they can be both times I called.

Having owned several Canon Pixma printers in the past, I knew it was a name I could trust as the primary purpose of this printer would be to print photos of our newborn. The first several photos we printed were fantastic. This printer excelled at color and black & white photos in the beginning. Then, everything started to look red. All pictures had a red hue to them - we looked sunburned! On top of that, after about 30 photos, the gray, cyan, and magenta ink tanks were low.<br /><br />Because of the reddish hue and, in my opinion, short lifespan of the ink, we returned this to Amazon.;;2.0;;June 11, 2012;;4;;5;;0.8

I've also owned other inkjet printers as well as a few of the old dye-sub printers. The Epson products have a reputation for offering a great deal of bang for the buck so I was excited to get my hands on an R3000 to see how things have progressed for Epson.<br /><br />The R3000 is an A3+ printer that has been available since March, 2011. It's a pro-sumer model that many serious enthusiasts as well as professionals might find appealing. It uses Epson's UltraChrome K3 ink set which costs approximately $229 to replace. The new 25.9 ml ink tanks were easy to install.<br /><br />Unboxing the printer I was VERY glad that my assistant was here to help. This thing is a beast. You will need a substantial amount of space and a very sturdy desk or table to use it. It's well made and solid.<br /><br />You can feed paper through a front-loading paper path or a rear tray. The front paper path is for fine art papers. You can also use roll paper although I did not test installing the rollers. Likewise, you can print to CD but again, since that's not something I need to do I didn't test that function either.<br /><br />Setup is a bit daunting if you are like me, and got tricked into installing Lion on your Mac. You should NOT insert the disk that comes with the printer if you are running Lion. Go to Epson's site and download the drivers, utilities and ICC profiles from there. Install them and THEN turn on the printer's power. After about a 10-minute wait the inks are installed and primed. Then you can decide how you want to communicate with the printer. You can use a USB cable, network cable or wireless. Since I placed the printer outside my office in the studio, I used WIFI. You can connect to the router directly through the printer's own interface or connect a computer to the printer one time to speed that process up. I just used the printer's front control panel interface to type in the password to my router and all was well on the first try.<br /><br />While I do consider myself a master printer when it comes to a wet darkroom, I don't do enough of it on the digital side to know as much as some of the real artists and experts. Believe me when I tell you printing is as much an art as shooting. But I do know what I like and my initial test prints were quite nice.<br /><br />I tested a variety of papers from Ilford, Red River and Epson. There were ICC profiles for all the paper so it was easy to match the images I saw on my Apple LED Cinema Display, calibrated by an X-Rite iOne system.<br /><br />Depending on the paper, you can get very sharp prints - if that is what you are after. There are many art papers, even metal papers available so I will experiment with all and get a detailed review of the papers up later.<br /><br />The paper handling and loading was a breeze - once you read the manual. Print times were reasonably fast, ink coverage - again depending on the paper selected - was great and color gamut was very wide. The blacks were very black but occasionally a bit blocky.<br /><br />There was no banding or metamerism on the black and white prints I made. Most prints were very consistent from print to print but there were occasionally very small variances that most people would not notice.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />The Epson R3000 is a really great deal. Considering the cost to replace all nine ink carts is rather high, that really great deal becomes just a great deal but a great deal nonetheless. I don't do a ton of my own printing but I am satisfied that anything under 13?19" can be easily handled by the R3000 and that the print quality will be first-rate.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I'd give it five stars if the ink weren't so expensive.;;4.0;;January 18, 2012;;12;;12;;1.0

My business uses GoogleApps, outbound SMTP requires encryption.  This printer does not support SSL/TLS for outbound SMTP.  Therefore, if your organization uses any sort of secure email or GoogleApps, you will not be able to use the Scan-to-Email feature.  If Xerox were to release a firmware update that enabled SSL/TLS on outbound SMTP, I would give this printer 5-stars.  As-is, I can only give it three.;;3.0;;July 8, 2011;;6;;7;;0.857143

Kodak Customer Serv Horrible;;Under protest, I ordered this printer through Amazon and received it a few days ago. I wanted to order an Epson model. I wish I would've followed my instincts.<br /><br />Important note: I have a lot of experience with both computer hardware and software setup. After following all directions to a "T" and upon completion of setup, this Kodak printer didn't print or copy. There was a loud and terrible grinding noise so I know that something wasn't fitting properly with the cartridges, even though everything "clicked" in as it was supposed to.<br /><br />I looked for Kodak's "Help" suggestions - in documentation, online, and then... the dreaded phone support. FAQs did not address the problem (that I could find), and all of the menus on the phone support keep directing you to the website, as if to say, "Please go figure this out on your own, you idiot. We don't want to help you." Note to all customer phone support departments: YOUR CUSTOMERS DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK WITH YOU EITHER, BUT YOUR ONLINE FAQs SUCK, AND TRUST US, WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF CHECKING YOUR FAQs FIRST. DO NOT TELL US 80 DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN GO TO YOUR WEBSITE FOR ANSWERS.<br /><br />So here's the part that made my blood boil. It took about 10 minutes wind my way through the phone menu (all the way to India). I talk to a variety of customer service departments on a daily basis (mostly outsourced foreign countries). I SPENT 23 MINUTES TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT SPEAK ENGLISH. I even very kindly asked for a supervisor or another service rep that perhaps I could understand, adding that I meant no disrespect to him personally. He put me on hold for 10 minutes. I hung up and contacted Amazon for a return authorization.<br /><br />I am fuming right now. I spent way too much of my day on this ridiculous and futile exercise with Kodak's customer service and then repacking this piece of plastic *&^@.<br /><br />Fortunately Amazon makes it easy to return these awful mistakes.;;1.0;;May 11, 2011;;15;;19;;0.789474

I did some research online, but this printer wasn't one that I looked at.  I visited a store and when I saw this Epson NX430, it was love at first sight.  I compared its features, style, cost of ink cartridges with a similar HP model.  I was leaning toward the HP since the last one I had lasted 8 years.  However, I chose the NX 430. It was on sale ($79.99) and, although the 3 individual color cartridges were initially a negative for me, in thinking it through, it actually is better.  When ONE color runs out, you only have to replace THAT color (maybe $9.50), not an entire tri-color cartridge, like HP, for $35 or more. The set up was extremely easy. The software was straight forward and easy to follow. At this point, I have it connected via USB cable, but I love the option of setting up wirelessly when I'm ready. The touch display is awesome and useable and understandable without having to read pages and pages of a users' manual.  The only negative, for me, is that the paper stands up in the back. I was never a fan of this style because, overtime, the paper bends and usually ends up jamming. The NX430 does have an extender, a guide, and a feeder guard to help keep the paper straight. I decided, since I don't do all that much printing, to just keep my paper handy and put it in when I need it.  This is a small price to pay for an all-in-one that is, otherwise, totally to my liking. I was satisfied with my old HP, but the MX430 has it beat!!;;5.0;;October 1, 2011;;27;;27;;1.0

After unpacking the printer, the 1st thing I noticed was how little documentation there was (about 4 pages), which could be good or bad - it turned out to be bad. I am technically pretty savvy so this wasn't much of an issue for me; however, I can see where some of the other reviewers are coming from, there is literally no real information provided before loading software later (not even how to load paper, ect.).<br /><br />I intended on using wifi only so I was only focused on unpacking and establishing a wifi connection. While it worked pretty easily, I had to disable SSID name transmission in order for it to connect as it could not find the network when manually entering the network name. this is troubling in that I hide my wireless network due to many attempts to enter my network in the neighborhood and the manual entry should have been sufficient. However, it did eventually establish a connection OK.<br /><br />I went through the simple procedures outlined on the nice touch screen interface provided and immediately came up with a "general printer error" #ox61011bed. Each time this was acknowledged and OK pressed, the printer would go into some process (like aligning heads, etc.) and eventually bring the same error message up.<br /><br />I thought that if I installed the software on my desktop that it would help me address the error. it did not and, after over 30 minutes of, what I feel was mostly blot ware software installation, the same error message came up from the desktop. reluctantly, I connected (on-liner chat) with HP (I knew better than to try and call!) and described my error. As most of you know, I endured the normal lame procedures these operators make you go through, until he finally determined it was a hardware fault that could not be corrected. Frankly, I am positive he had no clue what I was looking at.<br /><br />Needless to say I was really disappointed as this was my 1st experience with a dead piece of equipment from Amazon. I then found that I had to communicate with Adorama Camera (apparently the supplier), not Amazon about a replacement. they said they won't replace, only refund after I send it back and I can order again from whomever. By the way, HP did ofer a refurbished printer - yea sure! They also said Amazon will replace immediately - not true but of course but that level of customer service is getting to be normal (the exception is Apple).<br /><br />I called Adorama Camera and, to their credit they responded the same day with a pre-paid UPS label and instructions to ship it back. They indicated they would refund in 8 days if they received the printer as specified. This means packing it in original box with same tape, ect. (which is of course impossible!) and placing that box in another box for shipment (what a pain!).<br /><br />I will update this review after I send the printer in; however, after this experience, I am wondering why I didn't just buy from a store so that I could just take it back and exchange it?? Good question.<br /><br />UPDATE; 12/17/10 - Sent printer back and found that I had to load the packed original box into another box at UPS in order to send back. No real problem except that I had to pay for the extra boxing process ($8). I know, minor complaint but it was supposed to be free shipping. I will update when they refund as they said they would. I did buy a HP c410a as a replacement and am totally satisfied (love the Ipad functionality). If you're interested, I reviewed it also.<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/24/10 - Received refund from Amazon (- my box charge! above!). I am satisfied with the refund process and Andorama Camera. I'm sure this printer would have been fine if not DOA because the c410a is fantastic!  Even with the hardware problem, I am still satisfied with Amazon, their vendor and HP sprinters.  I did review the c410a if interested.;;2.0;;December 15, 2010;;12;;12;;1.0

After loading the proper drivers, Mac nicely finds the printer over bonjour and automagically sets it up as a printer and scanner (whoo hoo).<br /><br />The Ups:<br />- Fast printing -- From deep sleep to wake up it takes about 20 seconds to get the first page out (pretty darn decent for a printer under 200 bucks)<br />- Energy saving -- in deep sleep it consumes less than a watt<br />- Solid drivers/software that doesn't get in the way.. for mac at least (not sure about windows)<br />- Painless duplex printing<br />- Copying without the need of a computer<br />- Super light (25 lbs?) and small footprint<br />- Toner cartridges that don't cost an arm and a leg<br />- A button on the printer that stops the current print job (AND actually works.. unlike some lexmark and hp printers I've encountered which cancel jobs that HAVEN'T been started yet.. ugh.)<br /><br />The Downs:<br />- Automatic document feeding can't scan double sided... but kind of expected, although.. you can tell it to scan a stack of (one-sided) documents and print double-sided documents<br />- The scanner lid seems to be spring-loaded, so be gentle when closing the flatbed scanner<br />- The scanner lid only opens 45 degrees  not 90 degrees... maybe this is normal.. but my xerox copier goes all the way up.. ohwell)<br />-Getting this printer to work in Linux (ubuntu 11.04) was a little painful-- had to install the cups and lpr driver from the website.. but it's decently document on Brother's website, so check it out (hint: even though ubuntu "recommends" using the 7045 driver, dont.. use 7065dn.. using the 7045 will just send the printer data, and then the printer will just go back to sleep without printing anything).<br /><br />So even with all the things that I don't like about the printer, I still highly recommend the printer, given the price and how many features brother packed into this model.  I would totally recommend this printer to anyone in the need of b/w network printer.<br /><br />EDIT: 7/31/2011--<br />The printer doesn't seem to have airprint support (yet), so those of you who want to print directly from you iphone/ipad/iwhatever.. sorry -- it won't work out of the box.. you'll probably need to setup a print server. I'll probably try doing this on a dd-wrt instance.  Also, I tried using the Brother iPrint&Scan app on my iPhone, but it didn't work with this printer.. ohwell.<br /><br />EDIT: 9/30/2011 @ 5:05pm--<br />According to the handy-dandy printer statistics webpage built into the printer, I've printed 442 pages so far, and the printer is telling me that I'm running low on toner.  I'm using the toner that came with the printer, (TN420) which is advertised to last about 1200 pages.  I don't believe that I've printed any images or anything that requires a ton of toner, so I'm a bit confused on why I'm low on toner.  Still-- Printer/scanner is great.. maybe just a defective toner unit that got shipped with the printer?<br /><br />EDIT: 9/30/2011 @ 5:13pm --<br />I found this "toner save" option in the web interface, so I enabled it. (Oops-- forgot about that.  Printed out a page and in my opinion, it looks the same as when the "toner save" option was disabled.  Hopefully I'll get better performance out of toner cartridges now.<br /><br />EDIT: 10/19/2012:<br />Yep, printer is still running strong.. by the way, numerous people have commented that the toner included with the printer is a 'starter toner'.  So if you buy this printer, you'll probably want to purchase a Brother TN420 along with this printer (or upgrade to the Brother TN450, if you're looking for the high yield model).;;5.0;;June 24, 2011;;233;;239;;0.974895

My computer is a new HP Pavilion dv6 Windows 64bit Intel 7i processor.  One of the selling points of buying the printer was the compatibility to the computer.<br /><br />Color copies are nice.  Other than that, I feel that HP and this device are all part of a huge scam.<br /><br />The printer can't find my computer every time I go to use it.  I have to uninstall and reinstall the software every time I need to use it.  The firmware is up to date.  My computer is a new HP Pavilion dv6 Windows 64bit Intel 7i processor. Frequently the printer tells me there is no paper and I have to take the paper out and reload it 3-4 times to get it to recognize paper.  When I try to turn it off, the printer sits in shutdown mode for hours until I unplug it.  It won't even turn off.  When it does scan, it will not scan multiple pages in one document but each page as a single document.<br /><br />I called HP Support for this right away when the scanner did not work.  It took three phone calls and HP had to take control of my computer but in the end, the gal from India said it was not supposed to scan several pages into one document so was working correctly.  Not sure why they went through all the time and effort to tell me nothing was wrong.<br /><br />I have called HP again for the not recognizing the computer issues, paper issues, and other error messages.  The printer is 3 months old and still in warranty, however, HP phone tree sent me to the sales department where the sales person told me to take the current printer I have back to the store and buy a newer, more expensive printer from HP.  The one they tried to sell me was a laser printer with cartridges that cost $240, more than the printer itself.  Salesman basically told me that the small printer I had would not handle the once or twice a week printing/scanning I do and that spending another $100 to upgrade my printer is what I needed to do.<br /><br />I have researched the problems with this printer.  It is known for having connectivity issues.<br /><br />I would not recommend this printer to anyone and most likely will never buy an HP printer again.  When I call on a 3 month old printer, I do not want a sales pitch.<br /><br />Be ware of HP.;;1.0;;June 2, 2012;;6;;7;;0.857143

Believe the reviews that this printer runs out of ink faster than any other ink jet on the market.  I priced these cartridges carefully over 12mo before writing this review and have found the Epson ink cartridges *much* more expensive than other printer brands including HP.  Also, mac owners beware that although this printer states it has an "economy" or "draft" print-mode, this is absolutely false - googling this matter will reveal what I have found in that any mode other than normal will result in ink barely dusting the page and absolutely unreadable due to it being so "light" (any color other than black does not even print it is so light on the page).  If these issues were not enough to sway you to look for an alternative brand printer, when one ink cartridge is reported "low," the Epson NX420 printer will be completely locked and inaccessible, including the inability to scan something to your computer (an option requiring no ink).  I have just purchased another printer manufacturer and will likely not purchase any printer by the Epson brand again after this experience.  In short, the NX420 is the most anti-consumer price-gouging printer I have yet to encounter.;;1.0;;August 20, 2011;;8;;8;;1.0

Customer service told me they would call me back the next day, which they did not. I had to call again only to be told they would replace my brand new printer with a refurbished model.  No exceptions, no discussion, that's the policy.  What a waste of time and money.  I would think HP would stand behind their product and replace it with new printer.

I bought a monitor calibration device, thinking perhaps that was the problem. The prints still were too dark and the colors were off. I downloaded icc profiles for the printer. Things only improved slightly. I was about to give up on it, but then decided to buy a Datacolor Spyder3Print to calibrate the printer. I mucked up about five sheets of photo paper because I'm too stubborn to read the instructions. Then I watched the how-to video at the datacolor site. Two more sheets of paper and my Epson 1400 was producing beautiful prints, just like I had expected it to out of the box.<br /><br />So at this point, I would give the printer five stars, and I would give the printer profiles one star. Maybe the profiles work well on some engineer's computer at Epson, but not on mine.<br /><br />If you're looking for a large format printer, I can recommend this one if you also are willing to buy monitor/printer calibration equipment -- which actually any serious photographer probably should own anyway.;;3.0;;May 6, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0
R1AVG0GTYK2VKW;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ACBA1LZA9NXMH;;Printer;;B00450DVDY;;Brother HL-2270DW Compact Laser Printer with Wireless Networking and Duplex;;Good printer with some annoying quirks;;I just bought this printer for my dorm, because I've realized that this semester, I'll need to do a lot of printing... and walking to the library for $.10/side printouts was getting old. If the marketing material is to be believed, the printer itself, which comes with enough toner for 700 pages, is worth about 13 cents per page at the $90 I bought it for! Subsequently, with the $45 (currently), 2600-page toner cartridge, printouts will be under 2 cents a page.<br /><br />Things I like:<br />- It's small. Granted, it does take up a lot of room on my desk, but with their trays extended, most inkjet printers probably have around the same footprint. I'll soon have another place to put it, where hopefully it'll get in the way a little less.<br />- It has a nice, minimalist look.<br />- It's fast. In duplex mode, at 10 sides per minute, it'll beat most inkjet printers, even when they're set to single-sided printing. In single-sided mode, at 27 ppm, it's no contest.<br />- Being able to print double-sided automatically is fantastic. Even though paper is cheap (a fraction of the cost of toner), it still seems like a waste to print single-sided, and having less paper to carry around is nice.<br />- Though this is an advantage to laser printers in general, text comes out sharp, never runs or bleeds even if the page gets wet, and when printing double-sided, even on thin paper, toner will never bleed through to the other side of the paper.<br />- I can't use the device's networking capability on campus, but the ability to share the printer on a network without using a computer as a print server is very valuable functionality where one can use it. Even if it's only going to be used with one computer, and that computer is always right next to the printer, it's always nice to have one fewer cable cluttering things.<br /><br />Things that bother me:<br />- At its default resolution of 600DPI, some thin horizontal lines on certain fonts don't come through. I'm not sure if this is a problem with my unit, but it can be annoying.<br />- The user interface is terrible. I understand it's a low-cost printer... but I'm sure they could afford to throw in a few more buttons. It has only one button, which is used for all functionality, through things like holding it for some period of time, repeatedly pressing it some number of times, or turning the printer on while holding it.<br />- Related to the above: Canceling a print job requires holding down the button for four seconds. By this time, two pages will have already printed! Seriously, even if the device only has one button, could they not have it cancel the job immediately? I can't imagine any other functionality the button might be needed for during a print job. More egregiously, I've never actually had it successfully cancel a print job... the lights indicate it's canceling, but the remaining pages of the job still come out. The only way to stop it is cutting the power, which results in a messy jam that has to be manually cleared, not to mention most likely being pretty bad for the printer.<br />- The manual feed is near useless. About half the time, no matter how carefully I've tried, it'll pull the paper in one corner first. It's never resulted in a jam, but the printout comes out massively skewed.<br />- Others have complained about the noise from the fan. It definitely seems like there's no reason for it to run, even at low speed, for so long after it's finished printing. But I'd like to note an additional complaint: After the fan has stopped, there is a slight high-pitched electronic whine. It's hardly noticeable if there's any background noise, but when it's right there on the desk, I can hear it. Perhaps in a few years when I lose some of my hearing range, it won't bother me, but as it is, I generally turn it off.<br />- The power usage is rated at 65W when "ready" and 500W or so when printing. What they really mean by this is that, when "ready," it may in fact draw 65W on average, but what it is actually doing is, every so often, momentarily drawing something between 500W and 900W. This is something I feel they should specify. Especially in a dorm room, where a microwave, fridge, and printer might all be on the same circuit, blowing a fuse or tripping a breaker is a real possibility. When printing, the power draw varies, but often exceeds the average value of 500W. By the way -- the only advantage to having it stay awake for longer is that you'll save 10 or so seconds waiting for it to warm up before the first page comes out. Definitely not worth the 65W power consumption -- that's like leaving an incandescent light on. I have mine set to go to sleep after a minute of activity. This is probably appropriate for most users.;;4.0;;February 6, 2012;;11;;11;;1.0

I previously wrote a very positive, favorable review for this printer.  I only had it a short time.  I still stand by my comments that the picture quality on prints and cd/dvd's is unmatched by any other printer I own or have owned but now I must qualify it by saying ..AS LONG AS IT WORKS.<br /><br />After several months, one of the print heads went bad.  I tried numerous times to clean it and even tried new ink cartridges to no avail.  I contacted Epson support and after having me try a few tests, they sent me a replacement and I was truly happy.  I figured I got a lemon the first time and now it would be fine.  Last week, the yellow print head went bad, same thing.  I called and they said it was out of warranty.  I haven't had it a year, so I assume they base the warranty on the date of the original purchase only and not how long you actually have the printer.  Bottom line, in a total of 15 months, I have had two of these printers and both have failed.  Pretty short life.  It's like expensive rent for a printer.<br /><br />Yesterday I went to the Epson website and wrote a review saying what I just wrote above.  Today I got the following email from Epson:<br /><br />"Your opinion is very important to us and the Epson America community. We appreciate you taking the time to write a review on Epson Artisan 50 Inkjet Printer.

The setup and configuration for the printer, scanner, and fax was simple and intuitive. The Google Cloud Printing setup was great and simple as well. Print and scan quality and usability are great. Overall, our initial experience was completely positive. A very annoying driver download is the "HP Driver Utility" which installs a bunch of stuff you don't need. Avoid that at ALL costs!<br /><br />The really ugly wart for this product is the Fax utility and functionality. The only fax feature that works in the software is print to fax. There's no way to setup and configure a fax cover page (basic). It doesn't save the failed faxes, so you have to start over 100% every time. There's no addition and saving of contacts or integration to very common software, such as Outlook or Gmail Contacts. After four attempts and 3 configuration setting changes (on the device itself not through the software) we finally had a successful fax. But....no confirmation page was generated electronically or on paper. The Fax feature is a complete and total fail. Don't buy this if you ever want to fax. I don't even have the emotional energy to attempt scan to fax. Maybe someone else can give their experience.<br /><br />Seriously considering returning. Print = great. Scan = great.

It also replaces an old Epson 880 that finally bit the dust with apparently damaged print head. Repair for the old printers was impractical if not impossible.<br /><br />Set-up of the Canon is a little more complicated than other printers in that you have to install the print head and 5 ink cartridges. Read all instructions and look carefully at the diagrams and you shouldn't have too much trouble. The fact that the print head is an installable piece gives me hope that if anything goes wrong with it, you can easily replace the part yourself, instead of junk the entire printer.<br /><br />Setting up the wi-fi for use with my Mac laptop OS 10.6 was a matter of following the steps for programming the printer to recognize the wireless network. Installing software for 10.6 on the laptop involved downloading a newer driver from the Canon website. The supplied software installed easily on my old Mac G4 with OS 10.4. I connected a USB cable to the tower and it worked perfectly. I love the fact that the printer can be used by both computers, one over wi-fi and the other with USB.<br /><br />This machine is heavier and larger than the HP all-in-one, but hopefully it is also sturdier. It closes up completely to prevent dust from entering the machine. I like that the paper tray is under the machine and the paper lies flat. The interface is a little more complicated than some, but it makes sense once you familiarize yourself with it. Borderless prints on the supplied photo paper look professional quality, and you don't have to install a special photo ink cartridge. This printer is relatively quiet but a bit slower than I expected. The output tray opens automatically when you start to print, preventing the paper jams that occur with other machines if you forget to open the output.<br /><br />I have read complaints of the need to frequently change expensive ink cartridges. I find the cost of these cartridges about average. I think all manufacturers make most of their money on the sale of cartridges, so I don't know if you can find anything better out there.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase which costs little more than a set of ink cartridges for my old machines. The MP560 can do everything I hoped it would. Now the real test is if it still works as well 3 years from now...;;4.0;;October 24, 2009;;21;;21;;1.0

I've got no complaints.  It connected to my wireless network way easier and faster than I thought it would.  I love the wireless feature a bunch.  The touchscreen is pretty easy to navigate.  Haven't had any paper jams or issues.  I'm very happy with the quality of prints, and I've used both Kodak and non-Kodak papers.  Love the scanner/copier and the ports up the front for sd cards.<br /><br />Now, I'm not one of those people who complain about how much ink costs or how noisy my printer is.  For me, that comes with the territory of having the convenience and freedom to print whatever I want at will.  It's a luxury I like having, so I don't feel as though the printer Gods have to make it as cheap as possible for me to print my snaps.  When I need ink, I buy it.  Just like I buy paper.  I guess people forget that back in the day, we used to have to get negative film developed at the store and wait for it to come back.  Or process it ourselves.  You wanna talk expense?  Try setting up a darkroom.  If you feel compelled to moan about ink costs, or how loud your printer is, then explore cloud printing or any number of other options.  But if you want a great wireless printer, and the freedom that comes from printing at home, check this one out.;;5.0;;January 5, 2012;;18;;19;;0.947368

The output is fast and clear. Unlike my previous Brother printers, I haven't noticed this model eating up ink as often on self-cleaning. The unit accepts either LC 71 or LC 75 Brother ink cartridges (the latter contains more ink). I imagine there are some cheaper imitation ink brands you can buy that will also work adequately. Standard Brother cartridges will cost you an arm and several legs.<br /><br />Some nice features:<br />-Photo print<br />-Print directly onto a disc (CD, DVD, Blu-Ray)<br />-Wireless<br />-Nice software package to take advantage of printer functionality<br />-The standard copy and fax as found in most multifunction printers<br />-Fast normal printing with optional fast mode for even speedier print jobs<br />-Check ink volume from the computer<br />-Auto-duplex printing -- print to front and back of the document by itself<br /><br />I'm pleased so far with the unit.

First a bit about purchasing from Amazon.com: It's over $100 cheaper than at local office supply stores here (I saved $160 including tax), Amazon's service and delivery are A-1, and the printer arrived in great condition.<br /><br />Now about the printer: I've never had such a nice printer. In draft mode, it prints about 35 ppm, and the pages are very legible. Color copies are beautiful. For a home based business or even a small business, you can print your marketing materials on this and they will look professionally done. The touch screen is great, the set-up was basically plug and play. The fact that it takes two-sided copies for faxing, copying and scanning saves so much time.<br /><br />One thing that's lacking: I wish it came with a complete instruction manual, instead of just the fax manual, though.<br /><br />I love this printer!

It's a necessity in many cases, and has saved me a few times with last minute print jobs that I overlooked or the ability to print out drafts in a hotel room, conference center, or even airport. However, there a few things that really frustrate me about the printer. The primary of these is that HP should have named this the H4700-ala-carte printer because everything aside from basic functionality requires the use of a dongle (for wireless and blue-tooth, both of which cost nearly fifty dollars each) and if you want to print photos or graphics, you need an additional ink cartridge. Then there are a few functionality issues:<br /><br />1. The blue-tooth connectivity is a bit sporadic, and each time the signal is lost, it takes some messing around to get the print job started back up.<br /><br />2. The loading tray for the paper is a bit prone to jamming, but I suppose nothing worse than most printers with a top loading tray. This of course occurs at the worst possible moments; but that's probably just Murphy's law and not HPs fault.<br /><br />That said, once it is printing, it does a fine job of it. Text looks fantastic with the supplied cartridge, and is indiscernible from text printed on a standard printer. Set up is easy as long as the blue tooth connects, and the printer will churn out its 14 pages per minute without complaint.<br /><br />For a portable printer it's good but not perfect. Make sure you factor in the cost of either a wireless or blue-tooth dongle if you want to use it that way, as well as a print cartridge for photos/graphics if you're planning to print more than text. Even with a few complaints, the usefulness of the printer speaks for itself.<br /><br />4/5 Stars.;;4.0;;June 15, 2009;;24;;25;;0.96

I did not try the drivers that came on CD with the Printer. Printer was to be installed on my small network.  First I followed the instructions for installing print head and inks per instructions that came with the printer.  All went well.  Printer takes about 10 minutes to initialize itself.<br />Then started the HP driver software.  All went well , but at end an error was reported with my network  (Zoom brand wireless router).  I elected to proceed with installation.  Printer worked first shot, test page printed.<br />I printed several AutoCAD drawings in "General" mode.  All good quality.  Then drawings in "Fast" mode. Quite fast, quality OK, but not as good as "General".  Still quality more than good enough for review purposes.  All printed drawings were in monochrome.<br />So far All Good.  I will add more later as I work it more, but for now, no caveats.  Does a fine job of printing my AuotCAD drawings, and this was what I bought it for.;;5.0;;February 6, 2011;;6;;7;;0.857143

While the price of ink went way up in recent years, HP has gone back to the four ink system to keep replacement costs down. Bravo!<br />On to the machine. I ordered this and began the set up process. The only page I got printed was an automatically printed test page so I got to see some example of print quality.<br />The always byzantine HP set up process has hit a new high with this machine and after no fewer than five complete installs and uninstalls of the whole process it continued failing at the last ten seconds of a process that is almost two hours long.<br />I finally called tech support and they walked me through numerous processes and then internet downloads.

I gets 3 stars because it is a reliable and easy-to-use little printer, but there are some irritating things about it.  First let me say that this is the only laser printer I have ever owned, so I won't be comparing it with any other models.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1)It is reliable and gets the job done. It hardly ever jams or acts up.<br /><br />2) The toner is reasonable if you shop around for the best price (Amazon is always competitive, but not necessarily the cheapest if someone else is running a sale).  Keep in mind there are two toner cartridge types the tn330 and tn360 - I've only used the extended one (tn360).<br /><br />3)The starter toner you get actually goes pretty far - I printed close to 1000 copies, maybe more.  It is very easy to get set up and operate.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1)I have not done a good job at keeping track of how many copies I get out of one of the tn360's, but it often seems to not quite last as long as it should.  More importantly, the toner cartridges stop working BEFORE they actually run out of toner.  There are sensors on the cartridges that tell the printer the toner is low.  You get the warning messages, but the pages you are printing still look fine.  Then one day, it says the toner is out.  But the last page you printed was perfect.  Why?  There are sensors on the cartridges that the printer reads.  However, there is a work-around of this.  Go to You Tube and do a search.<br /><br />2)  Drum replacement.  After a few extended TN360 cartridges, I started getting the drum warning light.  A new drum costs about what the printer costs.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This printer has a huge hidden cost in the drum replacement, and the toner sensor is a little evil, but it starts off so cheap that it can be worth it.  I have not tried any 3rd party toner cartridges or drum replacements, but they are significantly cheaper than Brother stuff.  I am thinking of trying one of the drum replacements from a 3rd party *they go for under $60).  If I do and it works, it will make the printer a pretty affordable little workhorse.  If not, the best option seems to be to just buy a new one, because you get a new drum and starter printer cartridge.;;3.0;;August 22, 2009;;9;;12;;0.75

It prints fast and the printing is crisp and clear. I don't find it unusually loud and the size seems just right.  The duplex feature is awesome!<br /><br />I do have a couple of issues though.  One is that I've only had this printer for 2 months and have really not printed that much on it and I've gotten a low ink notice already.  I always choose to print at 300 dpi and in toner saver mode.  It seems to me that the toner cartridge that came with this printer prints even less than the one I buy for my cheap inkjet printer.  I knew it was really just a starter toner, but I was hoping it would last longer than this.<br /><br />The main disappointment is that I just discovered I cannot use the duplex feature on "user defined" paper sizes.  I like to print books using half-size pages that are 5.5 x 8.5" - there is no option to choose this paper size so I must specify it and in doing so I lose the duplex option.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />After reading reviews for the toner refill I became aware of a neat feature on the printer that allows one to print a report that shows how many pages has been printed and how much toner is left.  I pressed the "go" button 3 times quickly and a one-page report printed out saying I had printed 661 pages thus far and that I still have approximately 40% toner left.  This little tid-bit is actually in the manual, along with other uses for the "go" button.<br /><br />So I feel much better now knowing I still have plenty of life left on the toner that came with this printer.  I've changed my review from 4 stars to 5.  While I'm still unhappy about being unable to print duplex on custom size pages, I think for the price this is an excellent printer.;;5.0;;August 24, 2011;;9;;9;;1.0

Perfect "back-to-school" computer for the modern networked household;;Ordered the printer with Amazon's free "Super Saver" shipping and it arrived at the house (in Texas) 2 days later (which made me glad that I didn't pay extra for expedited shipping).  Excellent printing speed, excellent print quality, and an amazingly reasonable price for this very capable unit.  Initial wired set-up was a snap, and the kids were printing study guides and assignments like crazy.  For wireless networking you're generally going to need a spare ethernet cable to connect the printer to your wireless router (so you can configure the printer to communicate with your wireless network).  A potential problem here is that the instructions that come with the printer might not use precisely the same language/words as your router/networking software so it might take you a bit of trial-and-error to discover if your "Authentication method" really runs as an "open system" (as opposed to a "shared key", etc.), or whether or not you're really running data encryption (both "authentication" and "encryption" can be distinct from running a standard "secure" network using, for example, a WEP code).  If you're not sure and incorrectly enter your "Authentication method" as a "shared key" (because you use a network key to access your wireless network), you'll discover that the wireless link status "Failed to associate."  No problemo, but while re-running the wireless networking program you might find that your network stops recognizing your printer as a potential "wireless device".  If this happens, the recently entered (incorrect) printer settings might be the culprit so you will have to reset your printer to its "factory default" settings as described in the manual (page 43 on my version).  After the printer is reset, you can then rerun the wireless networking protocol and give it another go (while changing the wireless settings).  For my standard home network, the proper settings turned out to be "Authentication method" = "Open System" and "Encryption mode" = "none" (even though the later print-out showed the "Encryption Mode" as "WEP").  After entering the standard WEP code (as the "Network Key") the wireless link fired right up and the various wired and wireless computers in the house had no problem printing (after loading the drivers).  The above process took about 45 minutes to trouble shoot with the longest period spent reading through the manual so I could learn how to reset the factory defaults on the printer.  All-in-all, about average for a "Windows" install where you're stuck with somewhat ambiguous semantic compatibility issues muddled by imprecise directions.  As always, it's all good after the problem is solved.  Hopefully, these remarks might help you get to the good part a little sooner.  Good luck!;;5.0;;September 6, 2009;;18;;19;;0.947368

With the wireless function, not only can you print wirelessly, but when you scan, it automatically detects your computer (if you have more than one, the LCD allows you to choose which one to send it to). Unpackaging and setup are quick and easy.<br /><br />The CD contains all the software that you need. When you start the setup, be patient. Sometimes it will be installing something in the background but will give you no indications. I know that at one point I went three minutes when it seemed like nothing was going to happen, another install screen popped up.<br /><br />When completing the "wireless setup" on the printer via USB, the software will try and use your network settings to find what network the printer should connect to. This makes it easy as you don't have to enter your SSID and network key. If it needs you be on another network, it has the option to manually enter it. It also allows for you to set-up a static IP.<br /><br />The printer allows you to setup how long until it "goes to sleep". It will automatically wake-up when you send something to the printer.<br /><br />Colors look good. After you install the print cartridge, it takes about 5 minutes of cleaning.<br /><br />The printer is a bit noisy when it is printing, but I like that as I can tell from another room if the printer is actually printing without having to get up and look.

I've been using a brother 4800 series MFC for about five years now. I bought the original because I wanted a laser printer, automatic duplexing, and low-cost toner. The original delivered all that. I got a terrific deal on it as it was a refurbished model, but couldn't tell it from brand-new. It has worked flawlessly since I bought it.<br /><br />A while back I purchased a new laptop with Windows 7. I couldn't get the software for the older brother to work on my Windows 7 laptop. Time to buy a new printer.<br /><br />One thing was a must-have and that was automatic duplexing. Another feature that I really wanted was a wireless connection. I got both with the MFC 7860DW. Another feature that was at the top of my list was low-cost toner. The toner for this model is a little bit higher in cost than my old one, but not a deal killer, it's still reasonable.<br /><br />Installation was relatively simple though a little more complex than installing your average printer. Wireless connectivity though was a little more complicated than my inkjet printer. With my inkjet there's a menu choice that says "connect". I then enter my password code, push okay and everything is done. With my new laser there are quite a few more steps involved, making things somewhat more complicated. Not a big deal if you only do it once, but it becomes quite a hassle if you have to do it on a regular basis, as I did. The unit kept dropping the connection if the unit wasn't regularly used. I may be gone several days at a time and upon returning home would have to reconnect the printer. However I discovered my laptop was doing the same thing. The issue apparently was in the router, as I tweaked some settings and haven't had an issue since. I have two desktops and laptop and they all work fine with the new printer.<br /><br />These unit does what it's supposed to do..... Clean crisp text, flawless duplexing, and fast printing. I haven't really had a chance to use the other features such as scanning, and faxing. What few things I have scanned I've been very pleased with.<br /><br />All in all I am quite happy with this unit. Simply that it does what it's supposed to do. It's also an attractive piece of equipment. One thing I have noticed though it is quite a bit quieter than my old laser MFC. With the old one I could sit in any room and hear it printing, with the new one I have to get up and physically check the machine. This should please a lot of people as one of the complaints I have heard on the Brother MFC's is the noise. This one makes less noise in my inkjet.<br /><br />Would I recommend this to a friend, definitely. Based on my experience with Brother I will receive many years of service from this unit. If you're looking for a full-featured laser MFC at a reasonable cost this unit is it.;;5.0;;August 21, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

Other customers in the store today with prior experience with this exact printer wanted additional ones to use in their homes or businesses and now I can see why after taking one home myself!<br /><br />Since the bargain price was so low, the dealer only allows one per customer. I found one lone businessman who arrived and explained that he tried to get other family members to come with him so he could buy 3 of them but no such luck, he got the last of the remaining 3 right along with me. Another oddity was that some salesperson who tried to dissuade me from this product to another one offered later called the house and said that if there was any reason that I might be unhappy with it that they would pay me an additional $50 on top of what I paid-apparently employees are not allowed to buy the product at the sale price which was news to me!<br /><br />With this printer you will find it able to deliver truly professional all color prints whether graphic or photos. Other neat features, you can create a 'watermark'(a shadowy lettering/message behind the text of documents) on your documents in the form of one you create for yourself or use any of the pre-made ones so that your documents can have customized features such as 'confidential,' 'do not copy' or 'top secret.' There's more, but since I just got it I don't know all of it yet!<br /><br />Installation of printer drivers is easy taking less than 10 minutes and you can print, save or read the users manual. The unit itself weighs 31.8 lbs., fairly hefty as compared to other competitors in its type. Perhaps because of this it is fairly quiet as compared with another brand of high quality black and white only laser printer I wore out over the last year with reams of print jobs (thousands of resumes & still looking for another career position-'guess I will have to file for my 3rd extention if nothing pans out in the next couple of weeks!)<br /><br />Since I just bought it today I will post here to let readers know how well it does over time that way you can know of actual consumer experience to help you in weighing your purchase decision-let's hope the next couple of thousand resumes perhaps with color accents going out result in something!;;5.0;;June 13, 2009;;28;;36;;0.777778

FYI, the printer is still working well.<br /><br />**Update:  (June 30, 2011) After using this printer for a few months, I am dropping the rating to 4 stars.  I am still happy with the consumption and print quality, however, the paper trays are terribly engineered.  It is annoying to add paper or change paper from letter to tabloid size.  Lots of misfed paper and a few paper jams.  The wireless scanning software is not intuitive and works sometimes but not always.<br /><br />I did some serious research on all-in-ones before purchasing this.  I hope this is helpful:<br /><br />I had felt burned by previous HPs and Epsons because of the cost of ink and the frequency or replacing cartridges and I was determined to find an economical printer. . .

Some of the better performers are listed at the bottom of this review.  My research showed that each printer brand offers ink cartridges that are far more economical than others from the same brand.  Brother's best value cartridge (for all-in-ones) is the LC-65 or LC-79.  HP's best value cartridge is the HP940XL.  Epson's is the 127 ,  Lexmark's is the 105XL/ 100XL, Canon's is the PGI-7/ PGI-9.<br /><br />I chose this Brother MFCJ6510DW  because the cost per page for the Brother LC79 cartridge was one of the very best ($.0333 per page avg.) and the LC79 cartridges are very large so don't need to be replaced as often. (2400 pages black, 1200 color).  Compare this to my old Epson CX9400FAX.  ($.0595 per page avg., 370 pages BW and 500 pages color with the Epson 68 cartridge) My old HP was even worse.<br /><br />Read this article here: [...]<br /><br />I was a little skeptical cause I'd never purchased a Brother.  It is not as nicely designed as HP or Epson but it is OK looking.  I like that it can print (and scan) 11x17.  Wireless printing was pretty easy to setup and it works great.  You can even scan and wirelessly send the scans to you computer.  (worked the first time).  The only problem I've had with it is some minor paper jams but I learned that you have to load the paper tray just right and it hasn't happened since.  The paper tray is a bit inconvenient cause you have to remove the whole thing to add paper (like old full-size copy machines).<br /><br />I've had it for about a month and have printed a 2" thick stack of 8.5x11 color prints (with about 30% page coverage) on the highest setting and still haven't run out of ink from the original (non-high-yield) cartridges.

I've had the printer one month; am I sorry I bought the 4500 Wireless.  Other than the wireless feature, I can't say anything positive about this device.  It has frequent paper jams; the scanner turns white paper backgrounds into an ivory color background (making it difficult to paste scanned images like signatures into other documents with white backgrounds); it's very slow; black text often comes out gray, or worse yet, light green (!).

I was surprised by the low cost of this one. It is black and white only, but we have a separate HP Envy on our home network and just wanted a local printer for our home office computer.<br /><br />This thing is very fast. It really prints as quickly as a copy machine which is a real plus since I am used to inkjet speed. It doesn't have a large footprint. The controls are a little confusing at first, but I think in the era of touchscreen printers, the simplicity of the printer controls actually make them confusing. Imagine a printer from 1990 and that is what the controls are like. If you want a fast black and white printer that has a small footprint and would work as an adequate photocopier, this is it.;;5.0;;October 28, 2011;;8;;8;;1.0

If you're looking for a color laser for photographs or high-volume printing, this printer is not for you. I have a Canon inkjet all-in-one, but I wanted a laser printer for my small office that could add color to graphic elements like graphs and icons.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Fast to start (for a laser.)<br />25 PPM for single-sided color and B&W.<br />Prints color.<br />Cheap (compared to other color lasers.)<br />It has auto duplexing, so it can print on both sides of a page without having to feed the paper back into the tray.<br />It has an Ethernet port.<br />Very quiet on standby with low power consumption.<br />Text is very crisp.<br />LCD screen.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Not good for photos.<br />Colors tend towards oversaturated at the stock levels.<br />Minor page curl (depends on the paper.)<br />Likes to lie to you about the toner levels (but there's a fix for that.)<br />Toner cartridges are spendy (but you can refill them.)<br />It's noisy while printing.<br />No built-in wireless.<br /><br />The only real differences between the HL-4150CDN and the more expensive HL-4570CDW was a slightly lower PPM and the lack of built-in wireless. Since I had a good experiencing with my previous Brother printer (a HL-2150W,) already owned a wireless to Ethernet receiver, and felt an extra 5 PPM was not going to kill me, I went with the HL-4150CDN.<br /><br />The LCD screen is small, but it does give you the toner levels and tell you error/status messages. You still get more information through the Brother software, but it is more informative than a blinking LED. No more wondering if all the noise is going to result in a printed copy or the printer has hit a snag when you send a print job. I like the fact you can change the angle of the screen. My printer sits on a table with the top at eye level, but I can still read the screen at a glance without having to get up.<br /><br />For a color laser with automatic duplexing, you're not going to find a better deal in this price range.<br /><br />Someone asked me about this, soooo...<br /><br />HOW TO RESET THE TONER COUNTERS<br /><br />Open the toner compartment door. When the LCD screen shows the toner door open status message, press the SECURE and CANCEL buttons simultaneously. This will take you to the toner counter menu. Use the up and down buttons to navigate the menu. There are three counters for each toner cartridge. Reset the counters for the 'empty' cartridge and it will allow you to print. You will want to reset the counters again after replacing or refilling the cartridge. There are videos on YouTube that show you how to refill the cartridges. Just do a search for TN-315 refill.<br /><br />Hope this helps some folks.;;5.0;;February 5, 2012;;10;;10;;1.0

The Brother MFCJ625DW certainly takes up much less room than a Cannon MX860, which had a huge footprint.  The J625DW is ink-efficient, fast, quiet and very good quality.  An additional plus is the fact that this printer spends little time cleaning its nozzles, therefore using less ink in the process; generic ink cartridges are available at reasonable cost.  Ink color usage is also more uniform, i.e., all cartridges seem to be consumed at a more even rate - this is much better than my previous inkjet printers, which seemed to suck the ink during very long auto-cleaning modes.  The MFCJ625DW ink usage is minimal in comparison.<br /><br />Color photos are excellent.  Fax function is as expected.  Have not tried the scanner as yet, however, using the auto-feed copy feature proves that the scanner and auto-feed work just fine.  Duplexing feature is quicker than either the HP or Cannon.  BTW, I am using 24lb weighted paper and 69lb weighted photo paper - these feed through the Brother MFCJ625DW just fine.<br /><br />The only downside worth mentioning is that the function software for scanning, organizing, and general interfacing could have been written a little more seamlessly.  I have not used the Paperport software that comes as a stand-alone for organizing scanned documents, but I recall this software from the old Paperport days - it worked just fine, and I would expect this software to be an improved version.<br /><br />Overall, at the price I paid (&lt; $100) on Amazon, this printer really is solid.;;5.0;;April 30, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

If you are an expert, please pass by; but if you are part of the general buying public, learn from my  mistakes, if  you can.<br /><br />The machine promises nice features.  It wasn't that easy to set up, but it could be done without too much trouble.<br /><br />Why the complaints?<br />1. It is slow and cranky. It powers down between jobs. If you wish to print two photographs within ten seconds of each other, that is no problem. But if you copy a piece of paper and come back to make another copy 5 minutes later, be warned: it will take up 8 minutes to warm itself up again. Not such a good idea when someone is standing there waiting for his original.<br /><br />2. The ink. Oh,the ink.  So of course I had to buy a black cartridge and then a set of black, cyan, magenta, and  yellow cartridges. Since I have yet to print a color picture, I have never used any save the large black. But, within 2 months, the machine informed me that they were all low. At which point it stopped functioning. It will not scan, nor copy, nor do anything. So I spend 60 bucks replacing cartridges that have never been used. And now it says I need to replace them again. And it will not function without them, even though it has only been printing in black.  The result is that I have paid Canon an extra $120 .  I haven't found the machine particularly fun to use.  Sad to say, the lady at the Fedex/Kinko's calls me by name: it is easier and cheaper than using my Canon Pixma. To put this in perspective, I have only printed a total of 60 (sixty) documents (all black , all orndinary pieces of paper) on my Canon in the last 9 months, and am already on my third cycle of ink, i.e. $180. Yes, that comes to $3 a page.  I admire greed, but the Canon Pixma is beyond the dreams of avarice.<br /><br />I don't enjoy giving negative reviews, but most buyers are taking a leap of faith when they buy, and I am suggesting that they leap in a different direction. It is the advice I wish someone had given me.<br /><br />The above was my first review of a device, rather than of a book.  I am grateful for all the responses and comments it has received, all of which were helpful.  Thank you for taking the time.<br />I have long since adjusted the greyscale, although the colored inks do dry out and need replacing about every 4 months, even if unused.  And I do intend to use them. Contrary to certain comments, everything was done as directed.  Canon and Best Buy swear that the machine is not defective.  I would not have reviewed a defective machine, as this does nobody any good.  Costs of printing are still over two dollars (U.S.) a page.;;1.0;;May 10, 2011;;395;;417;;0.947242

This Brother model got good reviews and boasted all of the features I needed.  After receiving (fairly quickly after ordering it) a machine which would not work correctly - instead of moving the sheets down properly through the feeder mechanism to the return slot, the paper feeder would force the sheets to turn back up into the feeder cover, forcing the cover to pop open (at which point I was convinced that the machine suffered from a design defect) - I called Brother and they very quickly sent me a new machine to swap.  The second machine works very well.  The scanner functions quite well - I previously had a small footprint fujitsu - both with the flatbed and with the feeder.  The wireless functions are easy to set up and convenient to use, and the printing/copying qualities are more than adequate. For the price it is a very good and workable machine; I caught it on sale at Amazon and I'm glad I pulled the trigger.;;4.0;;June 4, 2011;;5;;6;;0.833333

If not, this unit is great.  The D480 brings office quality copying to the home environment.  Solidly built with good copy features, it works fast performs well.  Works in Windows 7 and prints fast in network mode.<br /><br />Network scanning is a weakness because the Canon software does not install a scanner driver and does not fully do the job. Plus, the manual is perplexing.  You need additional software (but one such product, XnView, fortunately, is free).  Open XnView, insert document and press "scan" on the D480, then "acquire" rather than "acquire from scanner" in Xn View.  Use this order because network scan mode only gives about 30 seconds to make the connection to the PC.<br /><br />If you scan a lot to PDF you might prefer a model which uses a scanner driver.  For occasional scanning, you will like the additional features in this method. I don't find scanning slow compared to other network models.  Why Canon does not bundle software is a mystery, though.<br /><br />Overall I give the product high marks but I paid below the $350 retail price and at that price other models have to be considered.;;5.0;;March 10, 2009;;7;;7;;1.0

So if you're eying an HP solution, chances are it's a really a Canon.<br /><br />BTW, the print quality is superb. Like any machine, if you want to avoid jams, use a good quality paper stock.

It prints fast.  The test page which consists of very, very simple, small, solid blocks of color  and type, printed great!  But it was printing only pure yellow, pure magenta, pure cyan. That is not a test of whether the printer prints well if it needs to print any other color. I have had good luck with other brother products in the past. But this one not so much.<br /><br /> I am printing out complex graphics and bought the printer because I read reviews stating that it had the best graphics and the one of best photo printing results for a laser printer.  But the first print, and every print I tried, was very dark, had an uneven sheen to it, and anything that was tan or pink was absolutely magenta.  The blues, which should have been light blue, were dark electric blues, It was not usable. I had printed the same graphic file the day before with  a Cannon laser printer and it was what you would expect from a laser printer... slightly saturated, but perfectly acceptable.  The color on the HL-4150 CDN is totally wrong. I am very disappointed.  I tried to call Brother 4 times and each time I was greeted by an automated attendant, put on hold for quite a while - (30 to 40 minutes)  and when I finally connected to a human being, they put me on hold and I was then disconnected. That happened every time.  I was unable to get any help from Brother. I tried adjusting settings on the printer all to no avail.  Went on line looked at the manual - no help. It maybe good for simple pie charts where the color accuracy is irrelevant,  but  If you need to print  more complex color graphics I'd have to say, this is not a good printer at all.

This machine has a fatal flaw--it won't allow you to print if one of the 3 color or black ink cartridges are low. And since the cartridges don't seem to have as much ink as other machines, this happens a lot, which is really frustrating if you don't have multiple sets of the four cartridges on hand. And the worst part is the machine won't even let you print in black and white when one of the color cartridges is low! And to put the icing on the cake, the company isn't responsive to online ink orders--I've had an order on backlog for now over three weeks. This means that my printer hasn't been functioning in three weeks. You as a prospective customer don't deserve this frustration--hopefully this review will save you some!;;1.0;;October 10, 2010;;15;;15;;1.0

Before now I've used an Epson photo/inkjet at home that works ok for color/photo prints, but is completely impractical for business needs.<br /><br />I just unpacked and installed the printer last night, and have not set up or used the fax function, or the copy function, but I am very pleased with the print/scan performance.  Since I'm scanning documents to Adobe format, I scan directly from Adobe Acrobat - I haven't yet used the bundled software.  Scanning isn't terribly fast (compared of course to the larger networked machines I use at work) but the sheet feeder works great, and at lower resolutions suitable for documents, it actually scanned quicker than expected.<br /><br />Now that the printer is installed and working, I'm very pleased with its performance - but wireless setup was not a total breeze.  After removing all of the protective tape, installing the toner, and setting up date, time, etc. (the printer has a great looking, bright monochrome menu/interface screen), I dug into the quick setup guide to configure the wireless settings.  After gathering the necessary wireless details from my router, the wireless setup wizard on the printer itself worked very well and had me connected relatively quickly (entering the WEP key can take a while - just like texting on a phone without a keyboard).<br /><br />I would mention though that, after installing the suite of software on my PCs with the included CD-Rom and restarting both machines, I was not immediately able to print to the printer and had to restart the printer as well for it to work.  Also, it appeared (can't say for sure, but it's never happened before) to cause both my PC's to reject my KVM switch until all USB devices were removed and reinserted).  All of that was a bit annoying since I had brought home plenty of work to break in the printer and ending up spending well over an hour troubleshooting.<br /><br />But again, now that things are set up, I'm very pleased with the printer.  I was going to spend much less on a wired machine that does not duplex scan/print, but I'm so very glad I paid a bit more for this one. It's a quality product.;;5.0;;January 15, 2010;;19;;19;;1.0

We needed something reliable that would survive printing at times up to hundreds of pages per day, but that would not break our budget.  After reading some reviews and looking around, we bought this HP, and we have been completely satisfied with it.  Hooking it up was easy, its relatively small footprint made it a good fit in our already-overcrowded study, and the print quality is excellent.  While the 1020's pages per minute (15) is somewhat slow compared to other laser printers currently on the market, I've been more than satisfied with this printer's output (it seems lightening fast compared to the 4 ppm of the old 4L).  I have only two complaints.  The first is that the USB cable needed to connect the printer to the computer is not included; you have to buy that separately (mine cost around $20).  The second, and this is very minor, is that, unlike our old printer, the 1020 does not power up on its own when you hit "print" and does not power down when the job is finished; you have to use the on-off switch on the back.  But that's a very minor complaint.  Overall, we've been very satisfied with this printer.;;5.0;;January 17, 2006;;9;;9;;1.0
R2UFZJ22IK816J;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AV252YPWNODEV;;Printer;;B0044XSNHG;;HP LaserJet Pro CP1525nw Color Printer (CE875A);;Good value, install on MAC not easy (install instructions);;For the price this a good color laser printer (I have given up on inkjets . . . inks run out too fast etc).  The device is not too big or heavy - we have several different color lasers at work and they are all monsters.  The toner cartridges sit in a tray and are really small, but should be very easy to replace.  Hopefully they will not dry up like my ink.<br /><br />The issue is that the provided documentation and online documentation is *surprisingly* bad.  Not sure if this will help anyone, but this is the install on a MAC.  First - the CD provided as usual had old software, so I downloaded the new software.  I read the readme file (useless) and online FAQ, and it is replete with errors.  It says to connect the USB cable when the software instructs you to.  On a MAC, it never does, and the screen simply is blank as it cannot find the printer.  So, just plug in the USB cable, adn the software will see the printer.<br /><br />Continue with the install.  It will ask if you want the device to be wireless (of course you do, that is the whole point of this printer).  Click yes, and the software will turn on the wireless card in the printer, and locate your Wifi SSID, if you have it broadcasting. (You can also try AOS setup but that has never worked for me).  Enter your password.  When it tells you to, disconnect the USB, and now your MAC printer driver should see the device.  So far, so good, and not too bad (just the error about wait for software to tell you to plug in USB).<br /><br />On the next screen it asks if you want to set up web services printing.  Here is where the trouble starts.  If you click that, the program will download a firmware checking software and run it, and at least for me as of 3/22/2011, my firmware was out of date.  So, you click update, and it downloads the firmware.  Problem 1:  If you try and update the printer at this point, it will report "Device busy, try again" - and the device is busy becuase the driver installer is left open.  Go back to the driver installer, click continue, and eventually ok, and that will close.  Now go back to the firmware updater, and it should update the firmware.<br /><br />Problem 2: At least on my WRT54G wireless device, the firmware initiates a new DHCP IP address, so, the printer now has the new firmware, but also a new IP address.  The MAC printer driver has the old IP address.  So, as I did not know how to change the software, I simply logged into the web server on the printer (using the new IP address), went into configuration, checked manual, and put in the old IP adddress.  You should also exclude theis IP on your router from DHCP assignment.  I suppose the other way is to uninstall, then re-install, the printer driver, and it will use the new IP address.  The moral of this story here is that on at least some routers, the device will be assigned a new IP.<br /><br />Problem 3 - at this point, a new tab appears on the device's web pages, for web print services.  If you click on that, there is an enable button.  What that is suppose to do, is to assign the device a unique email address through HP.  It never worked for me, it just reported "Unable to Connect, Try again later" - and I even pulled out an old windoze machine to make sure it was not some windows specific issue.  Never worked.  On top of that, when I tried to create an account at the HP ePrint site, the website simply was non functional on a mac . . . never could enter a new account there.  I tried safari, Firefox and Opera on the Mac.<br /><br />I had misunderstood what ePrint is.  I wanted to be able to print from my iphone and ipad.  Turns out, you can, without eprint enabled.  Works fine, and my ipad and iphone easily found the printer and printed fine.  ePrint is apparently just for web printing (i.e. you email a print job to the printer at the special email address it is suppose to create for you, that I could not ever get created).<br /><br />So, the device itself seems to work nicely and print fairly well (I do semi pro photography, and this printer is not really going to be easy to calibrate, I printed out the calibration page and noted in the whites that at least 4 boxes had no gradation).  However, the pictures look pretty good for everyday use.  I may try later with some satins and real calibration to see what I get.<br /><br />Finally it seems some manufacturers are waking up to the market share MAC users have and this device is almost there, but the documentation is horrible.  I also did try and search for FAQ and other users having issues, and some users reported some issues, but the FAQ on how to do a wireless install and firmware update on a MAC is just way too complex and wrong.<br /><br />- mike;;4.0;;March 23, 2011;;4;;5;;0.8

The printer puts out a decent print job but it is finicky as all get out. When you try to print a disk, you have to play with it for ten minutes before it will start. Then after the first disk, you don't just continue on, you have to play with it some more for each subsequent disk. The software displays a modular error window that you cannot dismiss (the 'Cancel' button does not work and the little 'X' in the upper right hand corner is disabled) -- nice touch. I'm writing this now because I just had to use Windows Task manager to close that dialog. The software is really bad stuff.

This printer has well documented problems with recognizing ink cartridges.<br /><br />My experience: I set it up per directions and installed all ink cartridges. The front panel status screen tells me that it can't recognize any of them. I re-seat them all with no change. I pull out one (any one) and it recognizes the others and indicates that the one I pulled is missing. I plug it back in and it indicates that all are missing. This points to a basic problem with the printer firmware or cartridge recognition mechanism. While trying to look at other printer status and the firmware revision, the touchscreen fails. Power cycle doesn't fix. Since virtually all user interaction is on the touchscreen, the printer is useless. Back it goes.<br /><br />I purchased a Canon PIXMA MX882, have been using it for a week and am very happy.;;1.0;;September 14, 2011;;6;;7;;0.857143

I wouldn't pay more than $20 for the thing because of the headache it took to get it going.<br /><br />It connected to my router easily and without problem, but I couldn't get computers to connect to the printer.<br />After a lot of searching and asking questions I found this information that helped me get it working through the wireless.  Hope it helps you!<br /><br />For Windows XP:<br />-Download the latest version of the drivers and software from the HP website.  (I got version 22.5.0).<br />-Install them and this time it will give you the option to connect to the printer using its IP address.<br />-Type in your printer's IP address and the software will tell you it still can't connect to the printer.  (You can find the address by printing a diagnostics page from the printer or checking the connected devices on your router.  Use Google if you don't know how to do these.)<br />-Tell the install program to use the IP address you entered and install anyway.<br />-This was all I had to do to make it work.  (Just make sure your printer's IP address doesn't change)<br /><br />For Mac OS (I was using 10.5):<br />-Go to System Preferences, then go to Print and Fax.<br />-Click on the '+' to add a new printer<br />-Click on the IP icon on the top.<br />-Make sure that the protocol is "HP Jetdirect - Socket"<br />-Type in the IP address of the printer. It should recognize the printer, give it a meaningful name and hopefully you will have success!  I did.<br />-Another tidbit I heard:  If it doesn't recognize the printer, go to the drop down menu Print Using, chose select printer software, and type in f4500, and it should be the only one on the list.  Then click add, and it will think for a second and the printer should get added.<br /><br />Follow-up March 2012:<br />We got a new router a few months ago and I still had the same issues installing the printer so it doesn't seem router related, but I upgraded to Windows 7 last month and it installed fine.  I didn't have any issue installing it then so I wonder if the issue is OS related.;;2.0;;February 5, 2011;;32;;38;;0.842105

It was a workhorse that finally met a timely demise.  Prior to ordering, I did my homework and compared several Canon Pixma models before finally settling on the MX882 as the best option for my home office.<br /><br />The MX882 arrived within days after ordering.  The first thing I noticed out of the box is that it was a bit bigger and heavier than my MP600.  The footprint was approximately the same, however.  Setup was a breeze. The wireless connection to all four Win 7/Vista computers in my home was effortless.<br /><br />Document printing is crisp and clean. Wireless scanning works like a charm.  I haven't yet tried the fax or photo printing capabilities, but expect them to be on par with the other functions.<br /><br />The only two minuses would be that the MX882 is quite a bit noisier than my MP600, and the ink tanks are about half the size than the ones my MP600 used, but cost the same.  I also would have preferred not to have the piano black finish, as it shows every fingerprint and is a dust magnet so requires more upkeep.<br /><br />I'm completely satisfied with my purchase overall and would definitely recommend this printer.;;5.0;;April 29, 2011;;10;;11;;0.909091

I had hoped to buy a printer to print our many family photos so that I could avoid going to the camera shop. I have found that the Canon print quality isn't acceptable to me--the color printing is not sharp enough or very defined. I have used Canon's photo paper, too. I will still need to go to the camera shop to have all of our photos printed. It is also a very slow printer. In retrospect, I should have checked out the color laser jets.

Yeah, right.  I happily bought a refill kit which has worked fantastically in both volume and print quality.  I'm not changing, nor am I wasting an extra $150-$200 every 2-3 months for my toners.<br /><br />I'm writing this review because a Brother Customer Support Technician wouldn't help me reset my toners.  After hearing his lecture on Genuine Brother Toners and his adamant denial to help, I offered him an analogy.  I simply asked if he went to a car dealership for "Genuine" oil, brakes, service, etc. EVERY TIME he had his car serviced.  He of course had no answer after recognizing his own hypocrisy.  So, to help others that may end up in my situation, here's how to reset your toners.<br /><br />If you have the starter cartridges, you will need to buy a refill kit of some sort, and a flag gear, or reset gear (see below for links).  If that is done and you are still receiving the "Replace Toner" message, here's what to do:<br /><br />1- Turn on printer<br />2- Open front door to access toners<br />3- Hit the "Start" button for the Black and White copies on the right side of control panel<br />4- Quickly type in the number "10" on the numerical keypad  (1 then 0, quickly in succession)<br />5- You will see a toner menu.  Simply pick you color(s) and capacities and reset as needed.<br /><br />You can now refill your toners to a high capacity level for about $20 each, vs. $80 for "genuine brother" toners.  Your cost per page probably dropped to about 3 cents each.<br />THANK YOU Brother Customer Support for motivating me to post this review.<br />All the best everyone!<br /><br />ADDITIONAL INFO 2 MONTHS AFTER ORIGINAL POST:<br />Print quality on multiple types of paper is just as good as "Genuine Brother" starter toners.

This is an update to my original review (see below).  To recap, I liked the machine in principal but it had a few severe weaknesses:  had to reboot frequently to get the computer and printer to talk to each other and it could not handle card stock.  I was managing to work with that until I started to get wide blue streaks across the pages.  Must be the print head, I thought, so ran the head cleaner utility provided by Lexmark.  After that was done I got a message that the process did not work and gave instructions how to remove the head and clean.  I did as instructed, put it back in, and since that time I only get a message that "there is a problem with the print head".  When I searched the web for solutions I read many reports of a similar issue with the print heads, with no one having a suitable solution.  Then I tried to find a replacement print head but they did not seem to exist. Long story short, I now have a $200 printer with unused ink cartridges and all together nothing works. You can take a chance and see if you can get one that works, but if I were you it is not worth the significant hassle.<br /><br />Below is my earlier review<br /><br />First of all, I got this printer mainly to print in black, except for the rare occasion that I want to print greeting cards in color, and to use the copier.  It seemed to be very easy to set up, and printing and copying is a real snap while it is working.  The problem that I have is that if the printer jambs, which is does frequently while printing on heavier card stock, the print spooler seems to get stuck and I get the "printer is unable to communicate with the computer" error message.  I am then unable to delete the item from the sprint spooler, and the only way to continue printing is to reboot the computer.  This same issue arises if the computer goes "to sleep" - all communications with the printer stops until a reboot.  I did not have this issue with any of the other 2 printers I have had in the past on this computer, only the Lexmark.  I did manage to print 45 greeting cards in color (with much difficulty) and the ink usage, both color and black and white, was very minimal, so the price of each color cartridge do not concern me.  Like other printers with a front load, the heavier card stock has to do a 180 turn to pass by the print head and that is where the jamb seems to occur.  If making cards is something you want to do I recommend getting a back loaded printer instead of this one.  I have not tested it at all yet with photos, however.  I have rated the installation as three stars because while the instructions were clear and the installation seemed to go easily, the problem with the necessary reboot to print so consistantly happening I just decided to blame the setup routine for not addressing this issue.  For those that this matters, I am using Vista.  The scanner works fine with multiple choices as to the output (Word, Adobe, print, etc.);;2.0;;November 9, 2010;;13;;16;;0.8125

And the wireless setup was long and tedious as it always is.  The copier functions from the keypad much like any copier.  And, the printer prints when told to by whatever software you are using to print as it should.<br /><br />Scanning is a different story:  You can carry out a scanning operation from the keypad, in which case your file winds up in the "My Pictures" folder (with Windows XP).  Of course, you aren't told this.<br /><br />The installation procedure also installs two software programs on your PC which enable control of scanning operations from your computer.  There is a little program called Control Center 4 which effects basic scanning commands and permits cropping before storing the file.  In addition, there is a commercial program called PaperPort 12SE.  Paperport has a really useful feature which allows a "pre-scan" operation.  You then bracket the sub-part of the image that you really wanted to scan (e.g. a stamp on an envelope).  Then you do a second scan.  The results at 1200 dpi are quite spectacular on items like stamps.  The Brother PDF software manual has an overview of the software and PaperPort has some help files also.<br /><br />Paperpoint places its work product files in a sub-folder in your computer's "My Documents" folder.<br /><br />One last note:  I missed delivery on the Appointed Day of shipment because UPS was instructed by Sender to obtain a real live signature from a real life recipient, and I was away for 45 minutes when the big event arrived.  So, be prepared to stay home all day on delivery day, and maybe for another day if delivery is later than promised.;;5.0;;July 7, 2011;;7;;8;;0.875

I use this printer with a Toshiba Satelite laptop and everything worked perfectly from the start.  Unlike numerous comments that I have read, I am quite pleased with the amount of printing that can get from the small ink cartridtes.  I refill my own printer cartridges, which makes my cost about $.50 per black cartridge reill. I have only refilled my color cartridge once and estimate the cost to refill it at about $1.00.  It only takes about a five minutes to have the cartridge refilled and back in the printer and have my ink back in my audit bag.

I have used Epson photo printers for about 10 years and was reasonably content with the results, although I was somewhat bothered by the slowness and never able to perfectly match monitor and print despite calibrating with a Pantone ColorVision Spyder2. Now, for the first time my print output is exactly like what I see on screen. The speed of the printer is amazing - a 4x6 on highest quality takes a bit over a minute and less than a minute on standard quality. Larger sizes also print five or six times as fast as my Epson did. The output quality on Canon Photo Paper Pro Super High Gloss is just beautiful - wonderfully deep and rich colors essentially indistinguishable from those on the monitor screen.<br /><br />The previous poster complained about the included software Easy PhotoPrint, but this application is not meant for sophisticated users. Also supplied with the printer is a plug-in for Photoshop, Easy Photoprint Pro, which allows complete control over the printing process, as does, of course, Photoshop itself. I was surprised to see that the print output when I let the printer driver manage the color handling in Photoshop was equal or superior to that obtained when I used ICC profiles and let Photoshop do the color handling.;;5.0;;December 30, 2006;;126;;128;;0.984375

After contacting the subpar support at HP I was essentially told there was nothing I could do. So I went and bought a new HP printer because I was generally satisfied with the printing results and assumed the problem with the first printer was just bad luck.<br /><br />Sure enough roughly the same amount of time has passed and this printer failed. It started by sporadically notifying me that my ink cartridges are bad. To fix this I would power off and power on. After a couple weeks of that it managed to jam its ink head cleaner into the ink jet heads and now it does nothing. It doesn't even power off.<br /><br />Throughout my PC had problems communicating with the printer forcing me to perform the voodoo ritual of turning on the printer, turning it off, unplugging it and then plugging in the printer once again.<br /><br />It is clear to me that HP no longer cares about quality.

I found the 9250 very easy to install and easy to use.  The print quality is better than the Lexmark and the ink cost about half of the Lexmark.  Where the Lexmark automatic feed was mostly useless because it would misfeed or feed multiple pages at a time, the 9250 seems to work perfectly.  The paper input on the lexmark would also feed multiple pages when the input feeder was low on paper.  The 9250 does not have this problem.<br /><br />The reasons I rated it only 4 stars are:<br />There is no way to fax from the computer.  You have to print the fax and then feed it back into the printer.<br />The User Guide is not very helpful.<br />The printer preferences does not have any means to enhance the print quality other than draft, normal or best.<br />The Home Center software does not know how to handle multiple printer definitions in Windows using the same physical printer.<br />Technical support seems to be in India.

The first one printed one print beautifully, but the next time we turned it on it went berserk -- whining, thrashing parts back and forth, and generally acting as if it had lost its mind -- or whatever passes for that in a printer.  After an hour with the Epson tech people (who were very helpful), they decided that it had a fatal flaw, and they said they'd replace it with a new one.  That one came yesterday, and produced one good print, after which it, too, went crazy just like the first one.  Well, the upshot is the same -- they're sending us YET ANOTHER printer, but if this one does not work perfectly, every time, right out of the box, we are getting our money back, pronto, posthaste and tout de suite!!!  It is appalling to me that a hitherto reputable company can get away with putting out an expensive printer that is defective at least 2/3 of the time.  What are their quality control people doing, anyway -- going out for martinis???<br />  I reserve final judgement until after the arrival of the third R2880, but right now all I am is disgusted with Epson, and VERY tired of waiting for a printer I can rely on.;;2.0;;November 28, 2008;;12;;13;;0.923077

That is one thing that the 5600 or most other models do not have.<br /><br />I was totally convinced that manual duplex mode had been taken out of the driver so that you would have to buy the automatic duplexer accessory.  However, much to my delight the manual duplex DOES in fact work.  It is in the driver on the Finishing tab (the 2nd one) and it is called Print on Both sides.  A window pops up to tell you to rotate the stack and put it back in the input paper tray.  I can't imagine this works because I installed it on a parallel port but maybe so. I did have a problem the first time I used duplex mode as it printed the stack out and never told me to put it back in then I couldn't get it to continue as no window popped up.  I couldn't seem to delete the job from the spooler either, even after I rebooted.  I then deleted my old 722c printer from the LPT1 port and after another reboot it started working - don't know what the problem was and hope it doesn't come back!<br /><br />Man this printer is fast compared to my last one.

My favorite thing about this printer is it prints on CDs/DVDs. I'm a photographer and presenting my clients with a CD that has pictures from their photo session printed on it is wonderful.<br /><br />The downside has to be the ink.  The printer costs right around $100.  It comes with 6 individual ink cartridges.  The cheapest I can find to replace all the cartridges is $65 + tax at Sam's Club.  So, is this basically a $35 printer????  It just doesn't make sense to charge so much for these cartridges.  I have come to find out that buying all 6 every time one cartridge runs out of ink isn't that great because some colors run out faster than others.  You'll end up with a bunch of one color and risk having cartridges dry out.  So, off to Office Max I go for $14.99 each.  These aren't prices for the high capacity cartridges either.  I can't seem to find those anywhere and we have every imaginable store nearby that sells cartridges.  Also, refurbished cartridges do not work.  They have to be a certain kind of refurbished cartridge. I've tried them and had to return them.  It only likes the Epson brand.  They can't be refilled either due to the chips on the cartridge needing to be reset.  You cannot even print black and white if one of the colors is out.  Even if you specifically tell the printer to print black and white it wont do anything.<br /><br />Print quality.  This is great for CD printing, but besides that I only use this printer for "casual" printing such as snapshots to just hand out to people or ones to make a quick greeting card for.  Everything else I send out to have printed.  The color from the printer isn't lab quality.

So far I am highly impressed.  The set up wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it might be.  The printer set up nicely and the wireless part (nothing is EVER easy when it comes to wireless) went off without a hitch.  I had to do the initial set up with a usb printer cable on my computer, but the cable is gone now and my wife's laptop picked it up and connected flawlessly.  I've used it already to scan about 200 old photos and the scanner was very intuitive and I really like the scanning software that came with it.  It is fairly simplistic, but I didn't really want it to do too much other than capture the photos.  (As a bonus, I could place 5 or 6 photos on the scanner and as long as there was enough space between them it automatically cropped them as individual pictures.  That was a very nice surprise.)  My one caveat so far is that I printed a picture on some glossy photo paper I had and it came out horrible.  When I tried again using the Canon Photo paper that came with the printer it came out excellent.  I'm not sure if I just didn't have it set right for the paper I used or if I just have to use canon paper with this printer.  I'm not too upset since the canon paper really isn't too expensive.  I'll probably check back a few times in the future to add in info on ink usage, but so far I'm very happy with the purchase.

I tried to circumvent the clogging by scheduling the printer to automatically print a color chart once a week, but there were two problems with this. First, there is an undocumented "feature" of the printer that powers it off after a period of non-use. I found no way of turning off this feature. Second, even when I printed out the color chart every week, the printer still failed the nozzle check and needed the cleaning cycle to be run again and again.<br /><br />I won't buy an Epson printer ever again.;;1.0;;September 14, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

They are consumer printers but have stood up well to the heavy usage that I subject them to, often running prints straight for days at a time.  Now that the 1280 is out of production I decided to move to the 1400 for printing my smaller prints.<br /><br />The prints are slightly better than those off the 1280 and the Epson interface is easy to understand...unlike my Canon IPF 5000.  But, after I did a ink usage test  I  was very disappointed.  The ink usage cost  for the 1400 is 3 times what it was on the older 1280.  One would have thought that the single color cartridge ink costs for the 1280 would be higher than the individual carts costs for the newer printer but not so.  Epson continues to sell a great printer at a moderate cost only to rob the customer with the price of their ink.;;3.0;;June 28, 2009;;10;;10;;1.0

When Epson thinks one color of ink is empty, it will not allow you to use the printer at all.<br /><br />Cost of ink.

For instance, the the built-in SD card reader is missing.<br /><br />I'm at a loss as to why HP took this route.  The name of the game is adding features while at the same time making for a smaller package.<br /><br />My company has nearly 100 HP 450/460 & H470 printers.  They are fairly robust and are small enough to fit within the confines of a backpack.<br /><br />But this OJ 100 is larger by over 20mm in width and 10mm in length.  It's also heavier by almost .5 Kg.  I know this doesn't seem like much, but it does add up.<br /><br />It also doesn't seem to be any faster than the H470 it is replacing. It also uses the same ink cartridges, so the print quality isn't going to be any better.<br /><br />The one I have here has Bluetooth (not a standard feature on the H470) but comes WITH a battery which was an optional extra on the H470.<br /><br />However, HP has taken a step backward by NOT offering USB cables with their printers.  This would be an item costing &lt;~$2.00,  I was personally grateful that HP included the USB cable along with the H470.  Too bad I can't get the H470 any longer.<br /><br />From a corporate perspective, I like that it uses the same ink cartridges which makes maintaining inventory easier.  I do NOT like that it doesn't use the same power adapter that the previous versions of the printers did. This forces me to buy yet another costly component that I already have a supply of, but was suddenly rendered obsolete.<br /><br />Overall, it's not a "bad" printer.  I just wish companies like HP wouldn't remove features that were previously included.  If you introduce a "new" model, it should be better than the one it's replacing, otherwise is as this one is, more or less the same thing but with prettier colors.;;3.0;;November 11, 2011;;7;;8;;0.875

Setting up the printer's wireless functions were a bit of a pain because the printer does not have an LCD/LED screen, so you must used the included (or downloaded) software to configure it. This wouldn't be a big deal if the printer worked as advertised, but it doesn't.<br /><br />As other negative reviews have stated, you can only use this printer for 10-15 minutes at a time with WiFi before it goes to sleep. Once it goes to sleep you MUST cycle the printer's power before it will work again... which pretty much negates the key usage of a WiFi enabled printer. Sometimes, the printer doesn't come back on via WiFi even after a power cycle, so you have to set it up all over again!<br /><br />I am no amateur when it comes to setting up printers, but using this printer is a frustrating nightmare that never seems to get better. Hopefully Samsung will eventually come out with a fix for this Wake On Lan (WOL) issue, but until they do, steer clear of this printer at all costs if you plan on using it via WiFi.<br /><br />In my home I have 4 Windows 7 PCs, 2 Windows XP PCs and a Windows Home Server, and they ALL have the same issue with this printer.

I always purchased the top of the line models. I always felt they had the best overall image quality, which was of paramount importance to me. The last two I had had amazing image quality, but I got so tired of constantly wasting ink to clean the print heads so I could get a decent print. Even still, I would print 5 or 6 pages, and then it would clog again, but printing 20 pages unattended, I'd come back to 15 ruined prints, on expensive paper no less. I wasted so much money on ink and paper for that darn Epson printer, I probably could've bought 2 of these Canon printers. Well, I've made the switch now, and after one month, I have to say I'm so happy I did. The color gamut of the Canon is obviously much better, and even prints on crappy paper look better than the Epson ever did. I don't suspect my printer will work error free over its life, but after the first month, its been flawless. The one thing I'm missing though is after some 15 years with Epson printers, i knew all the setting I could use to get a certain look, now I'm back at square one, but even with defaults, I get pretty amazing color fidelity. I've always trusted Canon to make my cameras (since my original EOS film camera in college), now they are winning me over to their printers as well. Thanks!<br /><br />(edit 7-25-11) I'm editing this review (going from 5 stars to 4) as I've had this printer now for a couple years and I have some additional perspective I can add. I still love the quality of this printer, and after 2+ years of operation I can say I have never even once had to run a head cleaning utility to remove streaks in my prints. Still has amazing color gamut and resolution. My *only* gripe with this printer (and its a big one) is the ink usage. It's a 10 color printer, and I can pretty much ensure now that every time I turn it on, it will need a cartridge replacement. At $120 for a full set of cartridges, that's a pretty hefty sum to keep backups around. I always do, but its gets tiresome. It also feels like it "replenishes" ALL the ink cartridges when replacing even just one. I have instances where I have one cartridge I replace and then during the "replenishing" stage, another cartridge mysteriously runs out of ink. I only use the printer a few times a month, so it seems like I'm not getting the maximum usage from the ink because of that. I purchased a much lower cost ink-jet now for day to day printing, but even that one, also a Canon, sucks up the ink like its free, though at a MUCH reduced cost compared to this one. So Canon, if you are listening, please ease up on the ink usage, or I might have to look elsewhere for my next model.;;4.0;;January 18, 2010;;31;;33;;0.939394

So far, the print quality is significantly better than what I experienced with the Brother MFC-9840.  It's almost night and day with regard to color quality.  I never liked the quality of the 9840, but the 9970 provides me with much greater color quality.  They certainly made an improvement in this area.<br /><br />The 9970 touch screen is nice to have also.  It's not a "Wow" factor for me, but it's something different, but nothing to be desired.<br /><br />The 9970 seems to be made with cheaper quality plastics, which seems to make the printer a bit more fragile, but we'll see how it holds up...I've only had it for less than a week.  But with that said, the 9970 also seems to be a bit more (and only a bit more) slim compared to the 9840.<br /><br />My only problem thus far with the MFC-9970 is that the installation cd that came with the printer did not work properly on my Windows XP laptop.  I had to go to Brother website and download the most recent installation drivers and software package.  This delayed my setup of the printer a bit, because I had to restart at least two times before I realized I should just try the Brother website.  Once I did, I didn't have any other problems installing the printer drivers.<br /><br />I can now use my printer for business presentations and not having to run to Staples or Kinkos because the 9840 color print jobs were too embarrassing to show any client.  Glad I took another chance with Brother with the 9970 because I'll finally get my money's worth.<br /><br />I haven't really checked out the Control Center 4 that comes with this printer model, but hopefully they've made some improvements here too.<br /><br />I'd recommend this printer to a small business looking for an all-in-one copy/print/scan/fax solution.;;5.0;;February 10, 2011;;105;;105;;1.0

Slight Inconvenience.;;Like many others writing reviews here, I was tired of dried out inkjet cartridges after weeks or months of no use, so went looking for a LaserJet printer for intermittent home use. InkJet still seems very popular, at least by my physical searches at CompUSA, Costco, BJs and Staples. There are less expensive laser printers out there (Okidata & Brother to name two), but a quick look at the supplies shelves at CompUSA made me shy away from all but HP due to expensive toner cartridges. Not saying HP has good prices, just better pricing than lesser known brands.<br /><br />Searching for wireless capabilities, so that I can place this printer anywhere, without having a dedicated computer operating as a print server, combined with a four-star rating led me to this printer on Amazon. Two weeks before Christmas they were sold out at the $178 price point.<br /><br />Second week in January, I searched for this printer again. They were available around $205 shipping included. When spouse informed me she would like a printer "tomorrow," I searched in Google, clicked the "Shopping" link on the left of the page, then clicked the "nearby stores" and found this printer at several box stores for $224.95. Staples was closest to me, so I went there and picked one up. Heavy-handed sales pitch for the extended warranty was not appreciated, but after 27 years in sales, I can say no to things I don't want or need.<br /><br />Picked up a sales leaflet on the way out the door and the next day noticed that there was a $50 recycling credit if you turned in an old printer, so went back to the store and got another $50 off the purchase by turning in my parallel port HP DeskJet 820. I had already thrown away the workhorse HP DeskJet 970Cse which had the ink spitoon overflow on my desk and white carpeting - ruining both.<br /><br />Unpacking the printer was easy. Zip through the tape on top of box, and diagrams on an inside flap tell you how to dump out the printer; but I was able to do so easily when I overlooked the diagrams.<br /><br />There was another quickstart diagram taped to the paper output tray, which highlighted almost all tape and toner sealer removal. Suffice to say, all blue and orange tape must be removed and the toner cartridges must be unsealed (pull the ring tab) to use the printer.<br /><br />Load up paper in drawer #2, plug in, turn on and load CD into computer. DO NOT HOOK-UP THE USB CABLE. HP PRINTERS LIKE TO HAVE SOFTWARE INSTALLED BEFORE CONNECTING TO THE COMPUTER/NETWORK.<br /><br />Software was about half installed when I got a fatal error: Error 0x80070570 The file or directory is corrupt and unreadable. File name: dpinst.exe . Tried again, same error. Pulled the CD - there was a tiny drop of glue or something on the CD face, but after removal, still error. Tried copying the CD to the harddrive and the copy program said the same thing: corrupt or unreadable file or directory structure. I.E., the CD was hosed. Incidentally, the corrupt CD was the updated 3.03.5253 version of the full install drivers and firmware update. IF you want to utilize the ePrint functionality, you will need the latest firmware update, at least version 20111215 or better. HPdotCom is the place to secure the latest drivers.<br /><br />Once the driver was downloaded (140MB), installation was easy. Mine was accomplished over the wireless network (Netgear WNDR3700 Dual-Band). Was also able to connect to the wireless repeater, though am having some issues locating the printer when it is connected to the repeater vs. the gateway router.<br /><br />==========================Later=========================<br /><br />Printer has been powered now about 4 hours. It has spontaneously "calibrated" itself three times, and does go into "Power-Save" mode after maybe 15 minutes. Even though in power-save, the wireless functionality remains on, so it will wake on demand.<br /><br />Sample pages look good printing on bright white 28lb laser paper.<br /><br />Now to the next computer...<br /><br />I could not find the printer from spouse's computer until I installed the driver (grabbed it from 1st computer across the network so I did not have to download 140MB again. After installation of software (which required installation of Microsoft Net Framework 3.5 on XPPro computer), the same initial setup screen appeared and I repeated some of the steps again. The software could not find the printer, so it asked to be connected via the USB cable in order to retrieve the network setup from the printer. This process probably took about 5 minutes, after which there was a message saying to disconnect the USB cable. Clicked the FINISH button with check boxes for "Make this my default printer" and "Print a Test Page" selected. The XP test page was printed, and set-up was completed.<br /><br />Now (so far, fingers crossed) whether I log the printer into the repeating router or the gateway, regardless of which router the computer(s) are logged into, everything works transparently - as designed.<br /><br />I even sent an iPod document to my new ePrint.com email address, and it immediately printed from the printer. Just like being able to print to a remote printer across an intranet or the internet! WOOT!<br /><br />==========================UPDATE after 30 days=========================<br /><br />Still happy with the printer. BUT, all users should know that you can adjust when the toner cartridges show that they are out of toner, as well as the action to take when they are out. They are set default from the factory to show that they are Very Low at 21% remaining toner. Like the HP CP2025DN printer one can set this printer to keep printing as the toner is almost exhausted (Stop Override), as well as set this printer to indicate the toner is "very low" at one percent (instead of the 21% which is the default value). Step by step is below. When I was researching printers, I ran across this tid-bit thanks to a comment written by Rob when responding to a review written by usna 76. Rob gave the step-by-step to usna76's last paragraph regarding "several hundred pages of printing left" after the printer "stops at Out." [permalink: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TU1FE13T1ZOQ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F0RI1I&nodeID=&tag=&linkCode= ]<br /><br />To enable the cartridge out override (which allows you to keep printing beyond the indicated toner out message as long as there is toner left:<br />1. On the control-panel menu, press OK.<br />2. Press the Left arrow button 3 times to get to System Setup, then press OK.<br />3. Press the Left arrow button 3 times to select System Setup At Very Low and then press OK.<br />4. At Very Low Black Cartridge is the next choice, press OK.<br />5. Choices are "Continue" "Stop" or "Prompt." Having read that HP's default has been that between 20-25% remaining toner in a cartridge the printer "Stops," I knew I wanted to override "Stop" by choosing "Continue."<br />6. Cycle through the choices until you find the one you want. "Continue" will allow you to utilize most of the toner you paid for. Notice that your choice at each menu level is indicated by an asterisk (*) to the far right of the LCD display.<br />7. Press OK to "save" your choice, then the right arrow 1 time which should give you "At Very Low Color Cartridges." Press OK and make the same choice as in steps 5 and 6 above. Then press OK (to save your choice) and wait two seconds to return to "At Very Low Color Cartridges." Then press the Return Arrow (to the far left of the menu buttons between the OK and X button).<br />8.If you want to adjust what your printer identifies as "Low" Toner level, press the Right Arrow once and you should see "User-Defined Low." Don't worry if you see Language, Courier Font, Contrast, etc. The choices "wrap" so you will eventually get to "User-Defined Low." When you do press OK.<br />9. You will see "User-Defined Low Black." Press OK. If your printer is set like mine, it will be set to 21%. By using the left and right arrow keys you can adjust the percentage to whatever you feel comfortable with. I chose 5% for Black and each of the three color cartridges.<br />10. By now I am sure you know to press OK to save your new percentage number which after a couple of seconds will back you out to "User-Defined Low Black." Pressing the Right Arrow button will take you to Cyan and so forth. Remember to double-check that the asterisk appears next to your choice as a confirmation that the correct number was set.<br />11. Press the Return Arrow (Return to previous screen arrow-(to the far left of the menu buttons between the OK and X button) about 4 times to take you out to "Ready."<br /><br />Here's hoping this helps you get an extra 20%+ from your toner cartridges!;;4.0;;January 15, 2012;;9;;10;;0.9

As expected, purchasing from Amazon was a breeze and shipping was prompt.  Setup, however, proved surprisingly frustrating as I simply could not manage to get the printer to recognize the print heads.  Despite my repeated, painstaking attempts to remedy the problem which eventually included a live session with a courteous and capable HP tech, no cigar.  Amazon made the return process as simple as possible and I accord them high marks for this.  At this point our need for a printer had become more urgent and I decided to purchase locally.  After consulting with a knowledgeable salesperson I chose the premium model of the same HP (Officejet Pro 8500A Premium), upgraded for a heavier duty cycle.  Setup proceeded without a hitch and the printer has been running perfectly for about a month now.  I am very satisfied with the support I received from both Amazon and HP.

I have printed on a range of media from plain paper to card stock to transparency foils, and it has handled all of these without issue.<br /><br />As for the ink being fragile, it will not wear off under normal use. Unless you normally scratch at your prints with your fingernails or other sharp objects. I did compare this to my color laser prints, and the Xerox is slightly more fragile.

I am still in deep mourning, and I would not have replaced it even now except that I was getting tired of not being able to print legible Mapquest and Google maps. So of course I stuck with HP. Major product loyalty here.  Every office I've ever worked in has primarily used HPs because we regretted it if we strayed too far from the mother ship.<br /><br />I've had this for about six weeks now, and I like it just fine.  It was easy to set up and the print quality is excellent (which, after all, is the big enchilada). It will also manually duplex, which is a feature I wanted this time and caused me to eliminate some other printers from the competition.  The footprint is actually about the same as my lil' 4L's, but it's so much taller it looks gigantic, which is a drawback.  I had read the reviews here before purchasing, many of which comment on how noisy it is.  That's true, but I found when going through the settings on the installation CD that it has a quiet mode, which turns out to be substantially less noisy than the regular mode.  It does slow the print speed down slightly, but one could always change the setting for a big job and go take the dog for a walk.  The only reason I'm giving this a 4 instead of a five is that it will be a while before I can fully evaluate how well the toner cartridges do.  Otherwise, if I can't keep my Laserjet 4L, I'll take this one.;;4.0;;May 15, 2009;;31;;33;;0.939394

There are always some pro and cons with everything out there now a days. The pros with this is that you can print images larger than an 8X10. The machine is capable of printing on cds with the right program and a cd disk holder that doesn't come with the American version. The European model does include this extra feature. I bought the extra cd holder on Ebay and it came with the extra program needed to get this machine to print on cd. The images looks sharp and clean with the right photo papers. The printer can print using two different feed on top and in the front which is nice. The printer is pretty straight forward since it is only design to print without having all the extra stuff that confuses you with those multi printers.<br />As for the Con the printer will only print good on Canon photo papers. I've tried several others like HP and Ilford and the prints came out bad.  The only other paper that I tried that looked good after printing was Staples Photo Supreme Satin. The Magenta and the pink runs out the quickest so make sure you buy extra inks. Other than those, this printer is a pretty good printer.;;4.0;;May 28, 2008;;10;;10;;1.0

It's great.  Believe it or not, I *just* finished up the starter cartridge-- true, I don't print that much, but I would say I printed a few hundred pages at least.  No regrets at all.  This shows really well for Brother.]<br /><br />[UPDATE: I've had the printer now for about three months and it's exactly what I wanted.  Not only that, but I'm using the ink-saver setting and am still on the starter cartridge that came with the printer!  As expected, there are now after-market printer ink refill options.  People were just being whiney.  All in all, I'm very happy with the purchase.]<br /><br />I too was frustrated to see so few reviews of this product as I was deciding whether to purchase it (there was only one yesterday!).  So, here's my initial review based on having used the printer for less than 24 hours.  I'll adjust if my later experience changes.<br /><br />First, the basics: the printer fundamentally does what it says it does.  It prints laser quality copies off at a remarkable speed (at least for someone used to an inkjet printer).  Nobody expects the performance listed on the box, I think, but just to give you an idea I tried printing a 19 page PDF document.  It printed in about 90 seconds: 15 seconds to warm up and process, and another 68 seconds to print the document.  That comes to something like 17 pgs per minute-- not the 34 ppm on the box, but really, who cares?<br /><br />As per the noise issue: yes, I notice the fan, but it's not as bad as everyone makes it sound.  I don't really think it makes a difference while I'm printing... afterwards, though, you do kinda wish it would shut off.  It's not a half hour like someone said-- it's more like 5-10 minutes, but maybe still too much.  I couldn't find a way to change the fan settings but it is something that could be fixed in software.<br /><br />As for the printer refills, yes-- it seems there are not yet aftermarket refills.  However this is unlikely to stay this way; one place told me to check back in a month.  I can wait a month, or pay for one Brother refill.<br /><br />SO FAR-- not a bad purchase for a Black Friday sale, not bad at all.;;4.0;;November 27, 2010;;30;;31;;0.967742

The Perfect Printer;;I normally do not write reviews, but always read them. I could not find many regarding this product so I will try to review.<br /><br />I am Very Happy with this printer. I decided to organize my recipes using a digital scrapbooking program. In my naivety I thought I could just print PDF files on my HP Photosmart on normal printer paper, but it striped the paper about every 1/4 inch. I needed something that would print 8.5 x 11 in. photos. Not only do the photos print incredibly well, but also I could print the PDFs on normal paper without streaks - it actually didn't look bad though the color was more muted and not as vibrant when the same was printed on photo paper.<br /><br />I was able to print about 75 8.5 x 11 in. photos before the colored ink cartridge ran out. I had purchased a combo, color and black ink pack, for just under $30 (it cost me $60 for a colored pack and $60 for black duo pack at Costco for my HP) and for under $20 purchased 100 pages of photo paper. I really only needed the color, for the black is still pretty full but it averaged out to under $0.70 per 8.5 x 11 photo which is cheaper than I could find otherwise. I purchased this printer for $220 with free shipping, so overall it is a very economical printer.<br /><br />The touchscreen is easy to use and accurately sensitive, The printer is compact and has a very sleak look to it and it quite sturdy; however, the paper feed tray and where the papers empties beneath it when coping or scanning documents is very narrow, yet this has not seemed to pose a problem for me thus far, but I have yet to do a larger document. We did have some problems connecting to our wireless router, but first, we have it hidden and second, we are certainly not the most compentant people when it comes to those things so I cannot rule out user error. We connected it directly to our router, then after it that, it read the wireless and connected without further incident.<br /><br />Though I have run it through some tests, we have not had it long, so I cannot say anything to its long terms durability or Kodak's customer service.<br /><br />I cannot say enough praise about it however. If your worried about the quality and the comparitively lower price do not be concerned. The printer prints far better quality prints in every area over my HP Photosmart which cost signifigantly more to purchase. If your concern is the single color cartridge over the having individual colors, I found for the most part my colors ran out farely close together on my HP, but also it was so much cheaper to buy replacements in combo packs that I really never just bought blue or cyan, for example, individually. Not to mention the the lower cost of replacement ink means that over the long run you'll save money on ink even though it has a single color cartridge. If you want high quality prints, versitilaty of printing options, and low costs this printer is it.;;5.0;;November 11, 2011;;90;;92;;0.978261

I am a frugal person and want the lowest possible cost per page so I have used non-color laser printers for the past 15 years.  My 8 year old samsung multifunction laser printer (copy/scan/print) recently started printing very light so it was time to find a replacement.  I have been shopping for a new multifunction laser (black) printer for months and I kept failing to find one that met all items on my must have list (see below).  I was just about to buy a Brother MFC-7840W when I spotted the OfficeJet 8500 claim of 50% lower per page cost then laser printers (fine print says "color" laser printers).  Even if the cost per page is equal to that of a laser printer I will be a happy camper.  The seduction of low cost color printing was just too tempting.  Only time will tell if this claim of low per page cost is true.  I was buying 3rd party toner for my panasonic around $50 and getting 1500-2500 pages easy.<br /><br />My must have list:<br />*under $300<br />*low per page print cost<br />*scan to PDF to computer<br />*document scanner<br />*document feeder<br />*ethernet (wired)<br /><br />Nice to have list:<br />*wireless<br />*removable paper tray<br />*double-sided printing<br /><br />Pros:<br />Scan to PDF to network folder<br />Scan to PDF to email address (one or multiple)<br />Email directly to printer (no PC required, just amazing!)<br />Print quality rivals laser (even on my el-cheapo laser paper)<br />Speedy printing<br />Network printing (wired and wireless n)<br />Easy Ink cartridge replacement<br />Apps (mostly fun, but great potential for productivity)<br />Touch screen (easy to read and intuitive<br />Minimal HP bloatware on clients (be sure to uncheck all non-required)<br />Easy network setup (wired)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Would like a little faster scan speed (I estimate max speed it 5 pages/min)<br />Would like a little better touch screen sensitivity (some missed presses)<br />No removable paper tray (you open the lid and slide the paper in)<br />Document feeder scans slightly skewed<br /><br />Don't know yet:<br />Long term cost per page<br />Photo printing (have not tried)<br />Faxing (not needed)<br />Wireless setup (I wired it directly to my router)<br /><br />My thoughts: (keep in mind I have only owned this printer for 3 weeks)<br />*In my mind the pros greatly outweight the cons<br />*If the 940XL cartridge lasts for 2200 pages as claimed the page cost should be low enough to satisfy my frugal side<br />*The scan to PDF to network folders is so easy that over the next year I will be able to take back control of my den from the paperwork monsters.<br /><br />*Today I would hightly recommend this printer;;4.0;;February 27, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

But with this Canon only after hours of fiddling around with it, I managed to scan a recipe as text into Notepad...and then it was barely readable! it was just awful looking with characters all wrong and would have to be retyped.

I bought this printer to replace my Epson Picturemate 4x6 photo printer and my Canon MP470 AIO.  The reason for the upgrade was that the older Epson would not play nice with my Windows 7 PC (though I could still use it with my XP laptop just fine), I've never been really happy with the MP470 as far as print quality (though scanning an copying was always pretty good), and finally I wanted network sharing capability.<br /><br />I was very afraid of getting a new AIO that was not up to the task of printing quality snapshots.  I was comparing the Lexmark Pinnacle PRO901, HP Photosmart Premium CD055a, and this Canon MG6120.  I ruled out the Lexmark based on it's office focus, I was afraid it wouldn't do well with pictures.  The HP got good reviews, but I decided to try the Canon based on the glowing reviews it and its predecessor the MP990 received (and 6 inks sounds better than 5 of the HP, though I know that doesn't necessarily make one printer better).<br /><br />I did have my reservations about the MG6120 based on my experience with the MP470, but I decided to give it a try.  So far I am not disappointed, in fact I'm amazed by this new Canon.  My primary concern is a non issue.  The photo prints look great; no banding at all, which I did see occasionally even with the photo focused Epson.  Print quality is easily on par with the Epson.<br /><br />Text and graphics printing is pretty good.  Not as sharp as a laser printer, but I haven't tried it with good paper either.  I think it will be adequate for printing important docs like resumes when I turn up the quality settings and use better paper.<br /><br />The set up instructions were thorough, but the process seemed to take forever.  I'm used to plugging in the printer, installing drivers and going.  This guy required installing the print head, the 6 ink cartridges, and letting the printer do an initialization dance.  I guess it wouldn't take long if I did it again, but following the step by step takes a while.  Software install took about 10 minutes per computer.  I set it up on my network by ethernet since the printer is located 5 feet from the router.  All my computers (win7 64bit PC, Vista laptop, XP laptop printed with no problem after the software was installed.<br /><br />Reliability and ink use are obviously TBD, but so far, so good.;;4.0;;November 21, 2010;;8;;8;;1.0

Of course, the printer manufacturers figured out long ago that they can practically give the printers away because they make their money on ink cartridges!  I bought this printer specifically because it will print CD/DVD labels.  And it does that very well.  The print quality is wonderful not only on discs but on glossy photo paper as well - I hadn't even considered that when I bought it.  I wish someone made a reasonably priced, high print quality disc printer that didn't involve manually loading and manually inserting a special tray.  They exist, but nowhere near this price. So, you do have to manually load a disc into a separate tray and then carefully align it with a mark on the printer.  Not a big deal, just a pain if you want to print a bunch of discs.  Print speed is less than a minute to print a full color image on a disc.<br /><br />But let's talk INK!  I did a lot of research and found hotzone360 on-line. They make Continuous Ink Supply Systems. Ciss Cis Ink Supply System for Epson Artisan 50 Non-oem For around fifty bucks you can buy an ink supply system with probably five times the ink in a standard cartridge.  Let me tell you, it's one of the wisest purchases I've ever made!  It took me about fifteen minutes to install (they offer a clear installation video on-line that I just followed along with).  So far I've printed dozens of photos and discs without any problems - and the ink levels have barely moved.  I highly recommend you consider purchasing this.  P.S. I found out after I purchase my printer that hotzone360 actually sells this same printer with their ink system pre-installed on their website for less than what I bought the two separately (not sure why the same combo is not sold on Amazon).  I'm going to recommend a couple of family members buy this package - it seems unlikely anyone can beat the quality and price.<br /><br />Great printer, great ink.;;5.0;;September 26, 2010;;7;;7;;1.0

If you turn on duplexing (even manual duplexing) you can't get high quality color printing--it always turns out lighter no matter how high you set the quality.  If you set the paper type to something like photo paper the duplexing option is not available.  Since I wanted to print some nice quality greeting cards (front and back fold-over) on photo type paper I had to turn off duplexing even tho I wanted to duplex manually.  Then if you set copies to something like 5 it prints 5 front sides followed by 5 back sides--on separate sheets.  So you then have to try to re-feed the sheets to get the correct print on the other side.  My old Canon MP830 was not this poorly designed.  Also the old MP830 had larger ink tanks (13 ml vs. 9 ml for the MX882), so ink seems to constantly run out on this printer and even tho the tanks are smaller on the MX882 a round of OEM ink on the MX882 costs as much as it did on the MP830.  As seems to be usual with Canon printers it takes a while for something to actually start printing when you send it to the printer.  I could tolerate this if it weren't for the other disappointments with this printer.  My old Canon MP830 was a very good printer that lasted several years so I didn't think about buying any other brand when I needed a new printer, but next time I guess I will have to look at HP or Epson again.  With the cost of ink being what it is, I think it would probably pay if I bought a new printer that's more economical on ink.;;1.0;;November 12, 2011;;25;;28;;0.892857
R28HY3GN3IBETH;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A32DB9IGJKJK7I;;Printer;;B002E1RITO;;HP Officejet 7000 Wide Format Printer (C9299A#B1H);;Fairly priced and reliable at first--Then, not;;Please be aware, before buying this printer, that it uses traditional four-color (cyan, magenta, yellow, black (CMYK)) technology. While four-color printing is the standard for offset color printing (i.e.: the process used by commercial printing plants), this printer is not capable of producing the lifelike continuous tones of a six-or-more color printer designed for printing photographs. That doesn't mean it's bad for its intended use--the speedy printing of typical business documents on plain paper, or getting output that simulates the four-color offset printing process--but it does mean that shoppers looking for photographic-quality output should look for a different printer better suited to that objective.<br /><br />On behalf of a family member who works as a commercial artist, I wanted a large-format printer to replace a pair of ancient Epsons that constantly clogged. I bought a new large-format Epson (Workforce 1100--see my review) thinking that 15 years of development since my old printers were made would mean Epson had solved the clogging problem. I was mistaken--it clogged almost immediately and took multiple ink-consuming cleaning cycles to clear before it clogged again--so I returned it.<br /><br />I was somewhat wary of this OfficeJet 7000, since it has gotten some very articulate and feature-specific negative reviews on Amazon. However, I took a chance because A. there are very few large-format inkjet printers available, and B. those that HP sells specifically for graphics users (DesignJets) hover around the $1000 mark--They may be very good printers, but I didn't want to spend that much.<br /><br />Making sure that the local store I bought my OfficeJet 7000 from had a reasonable return policy, I dragged the large box home and began to unpack it. The first thing that surprised me was seeing that it has built-in ethernet--a rare feature among printers in this price range. While I don't need to network the printer at the moment, and I don't know how well it works, it's nice to know we have that option down the road, without buying additional hardware. I connected it via USB (you'll need your own cable), and got to work.<br /><br />Installation of the printhead and supplied starter inks was fast and easy, and the software installed quickly on my Mac (OS X). As I recall, the printer then started its own ink priming/calibration routine that took about 15 minutes--a one-time thing, unless you want to manually run it again later (I have not had to).<br /><br />With its print driver set to maximum quality, output quality on the 7000 (from Adobe Illustrator on a Mac) is very good--Again, for its intended use of printing business documents and graphic designs with solid blocks of color, not photos intended for framed art. In general, output colors are very bright and close to what I see on the screen--and this is on plain paper--although darker colors (like deep browns) appear just a bit washed out, and there is no setting I can find in the print driver to directly fine-tune this density.<br /><br />Speaking of software, the 7000 comes with a decent CD that not only inserts the usual controls for various basic printer settings into the OS-level print dialog (OS X, in my case), but includes gadgets that let you run utilities on the printer such as head cleaning and additional calibration cycles (haven't needed it) and track what you've printed and how often you've interacted with the printer for such events as ink cartridge changes. Just keep in mind, if you are a user looking for endless print output tweakability, this software doesn't have much--It was clearly designed for the simplicity that business users want. The good news, as I mentioned above, is that I've found its output to be quite color-accurate without a lot of tweaking, even if the dark mixed colors suffer a bit (black is fine). However, if you really want press-proof quality output, check out one of the HP printers designed for the graphic arts.<br /><br />Like all inkjets, the OfficeJet 7000 is built on the model of selling you the printer relatively cheaply, then making money for the manufacturer on your future ink purchases. I can accept this reality, and the less-than-perfect color calibration (of dark colors) if I know the printer will work reliably, and so far this 7000 has been a champ. After years of dealing with the endless clogs (and unreplaceable printheads) of Epson printers, I am luxuriating in the sheer joy and novelty of a printer that just uncomplainingly puts ink down on paper without clogging every ten minutes. It's been six weeks and not a single clog. And while I would characterize the 7000's actual printing speed as "pretty fast" compared to my retired Epsons, the biggest improvement in overall output speed has come from simply not having to take time out to unclog the old Epsons' finicky heads.<br /><br />As for reviews that mention paper jams, I can only guess that such reviewers got lemons, because my 7000 has been jam-free from the beginning, even with light cardstock that has to bend around a paper path that starts with the front-load tray. I would have preferred a printer with the option of a straight-through paper path (like the Epson Workforce 1100) for heavier stock, but that's a minor quibble when you consider how much more reliable it has been.<br /><br />Update from 12/2011:<br /><br />Everything I've said in the review above remained true until a few months ago, when the printer began having problems feeding the last few inches of a sheet of paper. Remember, this printer is capable of borderless printing, something I use regularly to print designs to the edge of the paper. Suddenly, the printer began stopping its normal paper feed when the print head was an inch or two from the end of the sheet on such a borderless print, while the print head would continue going left and right and laying down ink as if the paper was moving. When it was done with the print, it wouldn't eject the paper, either--It just sat there, and when you physically yanked out the paper, you'd find a muddy mess of ink which reflected the non-movement of paper.<br /><br />Fortunately, I had purchased an extended warranty from the well-known national office product retailer I had bought the printer from. After horsing around with their online and on-phone tech support and extended warranty claims organization for a few hours, they finally agreed it was something not worth printing, and they refunded my original purchase price. (Although I was grateful for their honoring of my extended warranty, I was less than thrilled with their services. Not to mention any names, but I will say that their extended warranty claims organization did not exactly "Max" out my satisfaction level.)<br /><br />I applied the refund toward a new copy of the same printer from the same retailer (amazingly, for $100 less than last time), and within hours I was having what appeared to be USB communication issues (switching to ethernet bypassed the problem, but didn't fix it). More importantly, the new printer began to exhibit (within days) the exact same paper mis-feed issue that the old one had! This time, I was obviously within HP warranty and received courteous phone support. After going through their standard firm-grasp-of-the-obvious questions (Is it plugged in? Are the ink carts installed? Did you press print?), they agreed to send a replacement refurb unit if I send the apparently defective (new) one back to them. I will keep you posted on whether the new (refurb) one they send displays the same problems or not.<br /><br />Update from 3/2012:<br /><br />Since my last update, nothing about the paper feed issue described above has been resolved. The HP support group (based in a Canadian call center) has been professional and competent, but they cannot fix the problem of paper feed. I am now on my second refurb replacement provided by HP, and it has the same issue that extends back to the original model that I wrote the original review about. HP understood my frustration and offered a choice of next steps, one of which is a refund. After reading other reviews by users frustrated with similar paper feed issues, I have opted for the refund and will try a different brand, or possibly upgrade to the HP DesignJet model.<br /><br />In summary, everything I said about my original copy of this printer is true, and that one deserves its original four stars. However, when it failed after nearly two years, no replacement copy of this same model has ever performed as well again in regard to paper feeding, despite their consistently good print quality preceding the last few inches of borderless output. I will conclude this review by changing my rating on this printer to three stars and giving sincere kudos to HP's hard-working support organization, which has undoubtedly spent far more on servicing this issue and shipping printers back and forth than they ever made as profit on the device (of course, I have bought a few hundred dollars worth of ink from them in the last few years). If you get a good copy of this printer, it is very good. If you get a bad copy, it is maddeningly annoying for large-format/borderless paper feed, and therefore almost useless. Read all reviews and make an informed choice before you bite this hook.;;3.0;;March 14, 2010;;167;;173;;0.965318

Since this is an expensive repair on my trusty old R2880, I decided it might be more cost efficient to go with an entirely new printer, and this led me to look at the R3000.<br /><br />While I was replacing my printer, I figured I'd also take a look at the competing HP and Canon products. Side by side against the HP and Canon products, I found the Epson to be a shade better, especially with black-and-white prints. It's not a dramatic difference, and maybe because I'm so used to the older R2880, I'm just biased towards Epson. Still, for me, it was enough to confirm my decision to go with the Epson R3000.<br /><br />Compared to my R2880, it's hard to see any obvious differences on the R3000 in terms of print quality. B&W mode seems very slightly better on the R3000, and at magnification, small details seem slightly sharper. Otherwise, colors and so-called "bronzing" are about the same to my eye. Not that this is a bad thing, since the R2880 is a very fine printer in its own right. The R3000 uses essentially the same ink technology as the R2880, so I suppose not seeing a dramatic difference is to be expected.<br /><br />While I'm comparing to the R2880, physically, the R3000 is about an inch deeper, weighs slightly more and has more of a squarish look. Still, even though there are marginal print quality improvements at best, there are several features I found worthwhile compared to the earlier generation. Some little touches - the removable power cord, for example, are helpful. The larger ink capacity is a significant boost to me...I'm getting many times more prints per ink change, and that's a good thing. I like the integrated LCD display, ink level monitors and control menus. Lets me put the printer far away from my computers and still be able to control it when I need to. And no more manual matte black/photo black switching is also a terrific feature, at long last.<br /><br />Then there's the built-in networking capability, something I've been wanting for a long time. I was able to position the printer in another room, turn on the WiFi support (right from the printer), and now I can print anywhere without buying any sort of add-on network server. Getting up and running was really simple. I print from both Macs and Windows PCs, and once I had the wireless configured, I was able to install the drivers on multiple computers with no trouble. Whole thing from opening the box to printing the first page was under 15 minutes, and most of that time was installing the ink cartridges.<br /><br />Speaking of drivers, they seemed to work flawlessly on Mac OS X 10.6, Windows 7 and Windows Vista. I've printed with iPhoto, Aperture, PhotoShop 5 and Nikon's Capture NX2 with no problems whatsoever. I've used the print profiles for all the papers I like to use, and am getting the results I expect. All in all, no surprises - and amazing prints.<br /><br />I'd like to say that the construction quality is of a grade where the printer will last a long time, and for the most part, it is. If you print a medium number of prints, I'm sure this printer will last forever. Still, if you're like me and you print hundreds of prints every week, then I suppose the consumable parts of the printer will wear out long before the rest of it does, as was the case with my R2880. To me, this isn't necessarily a bad thing...I just assume I'm going to spend a few cents per page on printer hardware, and then I get to have the latest and greatest when they come along. At least until I find space for more of an industrial printer, like the Epson 7900 or something in that family.<br /><br />Definitely recommended as the best 13x19 printer currently on the market.;;5.0;;July 16, 2011;;55;;56;;0.982143

The Epson 3880 now allows prints to be made that should meet the requirements of even the most discerning user.<br /><br />Like others I moved from an Epson 2200. I would class that as a good printer (anyone want to buy one?) but it had limitations mentioned elsewhere.  For the serious black and white printer the 3880 creates the most beautiful prints that could be neutral, cool or warm toned and created with ease. And colors are almost bang on to my color calibrated monitor (98%) and with the slightest bit of lightening to the Epson setting they match as closely as two different mediums could ever do.<br /><br />It was just about perfect straight from the box.  I expected to spend a hour or two setting up for the first time but the very first test print was stunning.  Just like listening to music played on a pair of new and expensive stereo speakers, subtle nuances started to appear that I hadn't seen before. I made print after print each one showing some new improvement over the 2200. Then I went to 17" x 22" paper without any apparent loss of quality. On one print, in the sky, I noticed a tiny black dot. Had the printer done that? It could only have been a few pixals wide.  I got out a strong magnifying glass and looked closely. It was a plane. I could see the wings and the tail as sharp as they could be, but to the naked eye it appeared only as a black dot.

Uninstalled the printer. Pulled out the toner tray and pulled each toner catridge out and reseated.<br /><br />I had ordered an HP e520t a few months back and had hard drive failure errors until I pulled and reconnected all hdd power plugs...everything has rocked since then. Possibly same issue here I thought. It seems that components get jostled around during shipping and need reconnecting/reseating. Always a good idea to pull and reconnect as much as possible when a shipped pc or peripheral is received.<br /><br />Powered back up and during install I let windows automatically download the drivers for this printer (PCL 6). Did not install the PCL or PS drivers from HP's website. Calibrated via the onboard display menu. Printed first page and the output was as expected. Very nice, crisp, text and graphics. No more blurry colors. Exactly what I was hoping for. I am very pleased.<br /><br />My thoughts now are that it wasn't so much the drivers, but that the color toner cartidges (black was printing very crisp during the problem) were not seated properly so it affected alignment or output in some way, causing blur.<br /><br />****Rating is now 4 stars, versus the previous 1 star, since HP has had enough time to release Windows 7 64 bit compatible full featured software, but hasn't. HP says it will be forthcoming in the very near future.<br /><br />||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||<br /><br />Previous post:<br />Be very careful if you're thinking about buying this printer and are running Windows 7. You can throw the included software away and expect to download universal ps or pcl print drivers (generic) from HP's website. This is problematic for soooo many reasons. After 4 hours of "tweaking" various settings and making some improvement, I still come up with fuzzy, blurry, text and graphics. I've talked to HP CS and read just about every printer forum know to man. Forget it. I wouldn't dare attempt to print anything professional with this thing to send to clients. It will collect dust until HP gets its act together and releases the software and drivers meant for this printer.;;4.0;;February 9, 2010;;9;;9;;1.0

I'm glad I gave this machine a shot it performs beautifully albeit a few minor disappointments.<br /><br />Like anything else, the choice of a printer should reflect your needs and applications for use. In this respect the V525 is wonderful. It connects immediately to your wireless network without any hassle what so ever. The scanner is a welcome addition and any problems regarding Twain issues which often cause conflicts have been resolved by Dell.<br /><br />For daily use the printer is fast, crisp and the quality superb.<br /><br />Compared to my HP Photosmart 8250 the Dell falls short in photographic quality on a side by side comparison of the same images. This however, is only apparent when printing in the highest DPI. I would say the HP produces a crisper and richer image by 30%.<br /><br />All other settings are apples to apples.<br /><br />HP Photosmart technology is wonderful and if you use the settings at full DPI along with the Photosmart filters i.e.: Lighting, Clarity, Smoothing, etc the images produced are breathtaking. However,if you don't need to print on the highest resolution or simply go that route once in a while then it would pretty much be a non issue.<br /><br />Dell also has dedicated 24/7 support for their printers via net based and #800. I've only needed to call them once and the support was excellent. The ink cartridges are true to color and now available at any office store but they're VERY expensive. You'll find the best prices right here on Amazon.<br /><br />Set up is a breeze, it's well designed with a compact footprint so it'll fit most anyplace. Bottom line - An excellent all in one machine at a fair price.;;4.0;;August 2, 2012;;17;;18;;0.944444

Quiet, fast, could've been a great little product. But the whole point is that it is wifi, so it should be accessible over your wifi network, doncha think? Well, the problem is that the printer goes into sleep mode after a short period of time, after which sending it print jobs wirelessly fails to wake the printer up -- your print job just joins a queue that never prints. If you cycle the power then sure enough, it prints the queue. So in short, to use the printer wirelessly you have to go to the printer, cycle the power, then dash back to your computer and send the print job before the printer goes to back into a coma.<br /><br />This would be bad enough -- and it is a problem that is now documented on many forums and sites, yet Samsung has done nothing to correct it -- but the claim that the printer is easy to set up with a Mac is plain old fraud. The installation software for Macs truly does not work at all. I can't imagine how Samsung even let it out the door. The only (partial) solution is to let your Mac install the printer as a bonjour printer -- do NOT use the included installation disk. Oh, and as everyone else has been commenting, Samsung support was worse than useless, they actually made matters worse: the links on the printer's FAQ are dead and produce 404's, and you can't ever reach anyone who has any actual experience with the product.<br /><br />My advice? STAY AWAY. especially if you have a Mac.;;1.0;;November 12, 2010;;11;;14;;0.785714

I am so thankful that I have some system admin experience otherwise there is no way I would have made it through the process.  It took nearly two hours!  I ran through the Quick Start guide with no issues.  The printer showed that it connected via wireless and should be good to go so I installed the drivers (from the CD) and attempted to run my first print job.  Printer Status: Offline.  Huh?<br /><br />So, I did some digging.  I had to change my IP (manually using the printer controls) from Auto to Static.  I then had to create a new Port using the IP address (rather than the name) and change the protocol to raw.  I had to set the scanner to use the IP rather than the printer name as well.<br /><br />Really?  This is expected out of the box.  I have a simple home network - this should not have been so difficult.<br /><br />Bottom line, I'm still glad I got this machine but I would warn others that you might have to dig deeper than you're used to and/or comfortable with in order to bring the printer on-line.;;4.0;;March 18, 2012;;20;;22;;0.909091

It does everything I'd like when it works, and for that, I would have given it four stars. It's certainly better than the Epson CX4800 I traded it for. But it has numerous annoying little problems. It's installed on my network by direct connection to my router via an Ethernet cable. Every now and then, the screen goes blank and can't be revived. It says "entering sleep mode" for 5 or 10 minutes, but continues to allow printing. Online chat told me to shut the printer off and remove the power module, then turn it back on. That solved the problem, but when it happened again, they told me the same thing. Obviously, doing a cold restart every time the printer locks up isn't a solution for a network printer that may be some distance from the computer issuing the print command. A second call told me to download and install the latest firmware. I did that, and now the printer never enters "sleep" mode, even overnight, although it's set to enter sleep mode after 10 minutes.

I have used it for about a month now, and I am still stunned by the quality of print that comes from this machine. I have had many printers over the years, and still have a few A4 printers. I use my printers for both personal, and professional print work.<br /><br />This printer is very fast when printing in color. Considering the range of colors, and the accuracy it delivers time after time, I find it hard to believe that a printer at this price can spit out a full 13x19 lab quality print in about 1 min, 20 sec. It will print a similar 8x10 in about 30 sec. Wow....<br /><br />The color is stunning, and better than a commercial lab, as you can tune your print to exactly produce the result you want, and deliver the finished product within minutes. It's an entirely new level of home/studio photo printing.<br /><br />Pigment based printing has become the rage lately, as it has great colorfastness over time. Canon offers a pigment based printer in this class as well, but it does have a serious cost penalty. The truth is, the new dye based inks used in the 9000 are solid for over 100 years in storage, and over 30 years on display. That beats old fashioned "chrome" prints to near death. The new dyes also offer beautiful "visual impact" that many pigment printers still lack. Dark shadow areas remain clean as well, and do not suffer from "brassing" where pigment piles up, and changes the sheen of the paper surface.<br /><br />It's the bargain of the century that delivers awesome images on a wide variety of paper types. The driver/sofware suite is very well done, and offers many choices. You don't have to work around it. You simply work with it, and get a big smile every time.<br /><br />The downside is that if you print lots of large B&W prints, there are better choices out there. The 9000 does a splendid job of printing B&W, but it takes a LONG time to print a 13x19 image. I'm talking about 16 minutes..... Monochrome isn't so bad in time, and delivers very nice images, but if you are looking for true B&W prints that will stun viewers, you have to be patient when printing them.<br /><br />That's OK for me, as I only print fine quality B&W every now and then. The speed of full color printing on the 9000 is more important to me overall.<br /><br />There it is. The 9000 is a great printing tool, at an affordable price point.;;5.0;;August 21, 2007;;88;;88;;1.0

I thought perhaps it was my fault, a user error.  So to avoid the embarrassment of walking in the store again I called tech support.<br /><br />The tech support rep walked me through the problem.  There was a batch of these printers that when shipped resulted in a loose cable on the internal board itself.  He walked me through unscrewing the printer, opening the back, removing a cable and securing it more tightly.<br /><br />The printer worked GREAT after this.  I have been using it to print mostly addresses on envelopes.  The included cartridge ran out rather quickly.  I assumed this was because it was just a starter cartridge.  I purchased a new one which also ran out quickly.  After all, I am only printing addresses on envelopes.  I wondered why the ink was running out so quickly.<br /><br />I decided to investigate and take apart the cartridge to see how much toner was actually left.  To my surprise the cartridge was nearly 1/4 full!!!!  The printer must be programmed to report "empty" when a certain amount of pages have been printed despite how much ink was used.  Most printers have an option to circumvent this "quality control" feature.  But not this one.<br /><br />I would warn potential buyers against this printer.  It prints wonderfully.  But it is designed to have you purchasing toner on a regular basis.  This is how printer companies make $$ now.  They sell you a cheap printer and get you on toner.  The cartridges are also design so that they can not be refilled.  The printer knows when a particular cartridges serial number has already been used.;;2.0;;October 19, 2009;;24;;24;;1.0

In fact, I was surprised by the price on Amazon.com-only $199.95 when I purchased it--because I'm sure I paid more last year for the previous model Epson Workforce 840. That Workforce 840 quickly became the main inkjet printer in my home office, replacing two printers from HP and Canon that were once wired via USB to separate computers, and always running out of ink or needing cleaning. In addition to similar speed and high capacity paper trays and ink cartridges shared by the 840 and 845, wireless connectivity is another key reason I purchased the new 845, which has even more wireless features. With the 840, I was able to "cut the cords" at home, and since then my three teenagers and wife have been printing out their homework and email on the 840 using everything from their laptops to their iPhones.<br />This time, I got the Workforce 845 just to handle my projects in my office--although when my kids find out they can send me print jobs via the internet using the new Epson Connect feature I'm sure that's what they'll do when we run out of paper or ink on the home Workforce 840. Since I'm running a new service business in my area, I needed a printer like the Workforce 845 to print up lots of flyers, handouts, and mailings. Without a doubt, the incredibly fast printing speeds on the Workforce 845 and its dual paper trays (with up to 500 sheet capacity) are going to save me time, while its duplex printing capability will save me money on paper supplies.<br />Ok, I admit I'm one of those guys that stick flyers and coupons in your mailbox, in store windows, and on your car's windshield. In my line of work, doing so brings helps to bring in a lot of business, and that's one of the reasons I specifically chose the Workforce models and their DuraBrite inks. There's nothing worse than watching my outdoor flyers turn to unreadable, abstract art when it rains--which I often experienced with flyers I made with my old HP and Canon printers.  But the black and color inks on posters and flyers made with the Workforce 840 and 845 appear to be waterproof, and even a hard rain doesn't wreck them. More likely the rainwater will cause the paper to degrade long before the inks.<br />As for print quality, even at its fast default settings, text is very readable on Workforce 845, with high contrast and good detail. I rarely use it to make photo prints, but occasionally family members use it to make prints directly from their digital camera memory cards on glossy 4x6 paper or on plain paper (the memory card slots handle every type of card we have except for the micro-SD cards in our camera phones, which require an SD adapter). The large 3.5-inch color preview monitor on the printer also makes it easy to adjust photos before printing, or select menu items, quality controls, and utility settings. And unlike full-page photo prints made on plain paper with other brands I've owned, the Epson prints are instant dry, and don't buckle up the paper with extra moisture.<br />Other features that I've found to be well above average on the Workforce 845 are its fast, full-featured flatbed scanner (which rivals many stand-alone scanners for speed, quality, and advanced controls--but doesn't ship with film holders!) and its related copy speed and quality. The auto document feeder has never jammed on the 840, and it appears to be the exact same mechanism on the 845. The fact that I can operate the printer, scanner, copier, and even the fax from a wifi-connected computer is also pretty amazing.<br />With the 840's wifi, I also found it easy to print email and other documents from my iPad 2, but was bummed that I couldn't do the same with my Droid Incredible phone. Now the latest versions of Epson's free iPrint app is available for both Apple and Droid operating systems. These allow you to adjust and crop photos if desired, while Epson's Email Print lets you use any wireless computer, phone, or tablet to send documents and photos to the printer's Internet address.<br />The only features I'd like to see improved (besides including film holders for the flatbed as mentioned) are the size and capacity of the ink cartridges. I think a printer destined for office use, and sporting a 500 sheet tray, should come with larger capacity ink cartridges than the Extra-high capacity cartridges available for the 845. That way I'd get a break on ink costs over time. But I've got to give Epson credit for including a set of the Extra-High Capacity 127 inks in the printer box, and not skimping on the normal capacity 126 inks or even partially-filled starter inks like those found in other manufacturer's printer boxes.;;5.0;;October 14, 2011;;168;;178;;0.94382

As many have said, the print driver installation process is bad.  Real bad.  It takes a long time, and it give the installer no indication that it's working.  It appears as if it's just hung the machine.  Seriously, 10 to 20 mins to install what should be a very small piece of software is ridiculous. It installed fine on Windows Vista and Win7, but appeared to hang on my windows XP laptop.  This ultimately corrupted the print spool system which had to be rebuilt.  HP, if you read these review...please fix this software mess!  Love your hardware, but these drivers are awful.<br /><br />Oh yeah, we have a couple of iPads in the house and we've tested the ePrint facility that comes with this printer.  Works as advertised, but we don't actually use it as much as we thought we would.;;3.0;;March 18, 2011;;7;;7;;1.0

I find it to be a very nice machine, easy to set up and easy to use.  The price vs quality puts it up there with some much more expensive printers.  It's a bit much for a personal system, but for a small office the MX870 is hard to beat.  I have been very satisfied with all of the functions, the speed is great, the print quality is top notch, both color and black & white.  The machine is quiet & smooth, doesn't shake, rattle, and roll like my old lexmark did.  The duplex print option works just as smooth as everything else but it does slow the printing down quite a bit.  The only problem I have found is the machine is a bit slow on the warm up.  From cold start to print takes a little longer then I think it should.  If your one of those very impatient types your going to have a problem with that.  For the rest of us 24 seconds, more or less, will not be much of a problem.  It works, wired or not, either way, it works very well indeed.

For starters, you need to know that I am not a computer person.  Computers and I normally don't get along.  That is why when my PC died, I decided to get an Apple product.  All of my other Apple products are user-friendly, and so is the MacBook.  I purchased this HP laserjet printer becuase I was tired of the ink in the inkjet drying out.  The printer has a small footprint, and it's tough to find a better value for a wireless laserjet that will be used for miscellaneous home printing jobs.  With regard to the setup with a Mac, do yourself a favor and go to the Amazon.com review posted on October 30, 2010 by R. Ruiz.  He sets forth 28 steps to follow after you have downloaded the software that comes with the printer.  I had no idea what I was doing, but I followed the very specific and accurate instructions by R. Ruiz and sure enough, the printer was installed with wireless capabilities.  Not including the time it took to take the printer out of the box and plug it in, the installation took only 15 minutes.  Do not be scared off by other reviews that bemoan the difficulties with installing the printer on a Mac.  While the reviews are correct that the HP software and instructional booklet are useless when setting up the printer wirelessly with a Mac, the review by R. Ruiz includes all of the instructions you need.;;5.0;;December 1, 2010;;22;;23;;0.956522

But I have dropped it to 2 stars now that I have encountered what others have complained about. Not just the slow warm-up. Not just using up ink quickly. That has always been my experience with colored printers. What really made me come back and re-rate this was the fact that if ANY cartridge runs out you cannot print ANYTHING! My cyan cartridge ran out of ink and the printer would not allow me to print even a black and white page! That they would design it so you can't print black because you are out of blue is just ridiculous! I had plenty of black ink. I just wanted to print black text. I should not have been forced to go buy a cyan cartridge just to print black text! Even if I wanted to print a blue image without cyan that should be MY choice to print a bad page. I mean, sometimes it really doesn't matter, like when you just want to print a Google map for directions. If you are in a hurry and need to print directions fast, you don't care if the map is pretty. The important thing is to get your directions printed. What if you needed to print a resume just before going to a job interview? Or a print a report before a meeting? If you're in a hurry you need to be able to just print with whatever colors you have. You sure don't have time to run out and buy ink first. You'd better make sure you always have spare cartridges on hand! This is very annoying. I had a Hewlett-Packard printer before this one and when my HP ran out of ink it continued to print anyway. The colors just weren't accurate. But it still worked if you really needed to print something.;;2.0;;May 11, 2012;;8;;9;;0.888889

At home I own a similar but more expensive Brother unit.  After reviewing many specs and noting the fair price this one (model 2230) looked like a good choice.<br />I am very satisfied with the printing from the tray and the options such as the ability to save toner when this mode is set.  It is fast (24 ppm claimed) and in normal printing from the tray reliable.<br /><br />It is however just AWFUL if you want to print envelopes (e.g., using Microsoft Word as the program).  I have only tried in on regular #10 business envelopes.  In this case at best they come out wrinkled and worse case the error light comes on and it won't print even if there is no jam.  I have to power down, wait for it to "clear" itself, and try again.<br /><br />So if you just want to print 8 ?" x 11" documents, you'll be happy.

It prints regular documents and photos, scans, copies, and faxes, all in a single machine.<br /><br />The paper tray holds approximately 135 sheets, so if you print a lot, you might be better off with the Epson WorkForce 840 Wireless All-in-One, which holds 500 sheets, but this Canon feels both sturdier and more compact than the Epson.<br /><br />It's relatively easy to set up using the supplied instructions.  I wish Canon made it easier by installing the print head at the factory; although it isn't difficult to do, that step irked me since I didn't have to do it on my Epson or my HP.  The inks are included -- three color cartridges (#226), a black photo ink (also #226), and a black document ink (#225.)  The ink cartridges seem smaller than my HP Photosmart ones, although I can't tell you how they compare in terms of actual amount. I recommend shopping around to find a good source of brand-name inks.  Don't bother with generics.  I had the printer up and running about ten minutes after I opened the box -- on the network, configured for faxes, and stocked with paper and ink.<br /><br />For wireless use, you must install the software on each machine that will use the printer.  For initial set-up to get the printer on your network, you'll need to know the network security password, but after that, you just need to configure the settings on each computer. Once that's done, you can print wirelessly from anywhere in the network, on both Macs and PCs.  I was astounded by how quickly this worked, even from the other side of the house.<br /><br />I highly recommend this printer.  It's the best of the Canon wireless All-in-One line.  Some of the other models don't have all four functions (print, scan, copy, fax), so make sure you look carefully to see which one is best for you.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann;;5.0;;June 10, 2011;;10;;10;;1.0

The features are amazing, the speed is amazing, and the clarity is awesome. However, if you are like many in my office who have difficulty adapting to new machines without the ability to dedicate the hours it takes to properly begin using this machine then I do not recommend anyone purchase this machine. Thankfully I do feel comfortable deviating from the directions of technical manuals in order to make a machine work.<br /><br />Long story short, the directions are terribly written and most of the time I have found myself trouble shooting basic needs in the office by figuring it all out on my own without the directions book. I feel the directions should be re-written after a few test runs over basic printer errors are corrected. Clearly, these directions were written by a tech who has no experience dealing with normal people and has written them with technical jargon too advanced for the common person.<br /><br />The other thing that disturbs me about this printer is the constant resetting of modes by turning the machine on and turning it back off. The way Canon has decided to allow users to change technical settings on the product requires shutting the machine down and letting it reset itself to your new settings. This slows down the office dramatically because you will be without a fax or copier while you may want to quickly change the default settings. I constantly find myself having to do this over the basic tweaks in the settings to provide better defaults to my fellow employees.<br /><br />I repeat, if you have the time to mess around with the unit (5hours or more, plus quick training for each person 30 minutes each) than buy the unit because the features are worth it. If you do not have the time to set-up and waste a day, do not buy the printer because I am sure there are better and quicker machines on the market for similar price.;;2.0;;February 29, 2012;;19;;20;;0.95

Some things I want to answer to the questions I had before buying are:<br /><br />Is the scanner wireless?<br />After browsing through many different printers, I noticed on other printers that the scanner was not wireless. So even though one could print wirelessly, a cord had to be used when you wanted to scan something to your printer. This is not true for this printer. It literally does EVERYTHING wirelessly (except receive power of course)<br /><br />How long did it take to set it up?<br />Once I took it out of the box within 10 minutes it was ready to print/scan/fax. Set up was really easy. Read the set-up packet before you start following directions on the printer. Apparently the directions tell you to skip some steps that the printer itself may ask. BUT I didn't read the directions first, and everything turned out okay, so hopefully it will for you as well.<br /><br />Fax?<br />So my printer is not hooked up to a phone line or ethernet. I have the fax option on my computer for it, so I assume I can fax out but maybe not receive faxes. I am not sure so I will have to investigate and fill you in on this.<br /><br />What is the print quality?<br />I will use this printer mostly for my college work. So far with the random prints I have made so far, I have no complaints. It is definitely better than any HP printer I have had.<br /><br />Scan/Copy Feeder?<br />I like it a lot! It's quick and easy to load. It can scan in .pdf, but I am not sure if it is a searchable .pdf document.<br /><br />Loading paper?<br />On the actual printer I kept looking for the 8 1/2 x 11 and it didn't have it anywhere, so make sure you know if you are using legal or letter paper. :)<br /><br />Any other questions you may have, just reply and I will try to answer as much as I can.<br /><br />--------UPDATES-----------<br />-With the scanner you can scan straight to a USB Jump Drive without having to use your computer as a middle man. The ADF seems to only accept 8.5 by (X) paper with the 8.5 side feeding in the scanner.<br />-When scanning with the ADF, scans can be placed in one file (with different options for extensions, .pdf, .jpg, etc).;;5.0;;July 24, 2012;;7;;7;;1.0

I then called the support number and James asked me to go thru the deep cleaning process again to no avail.  Same issues.  He said he would mail me a printhead with new ink cartridges.  Upon my asking that I had read about known issues with the print head and that the new one would fail also he acknowledged the issue but said that with the firmware update it would not happen.  I am no printer designer but a firmware update resolving print head issues does not give me a warm fuzzy.  Will wait for the print head and update this review.<br /><br />I am surprised that basic printing issues like this get past Lexmark's product testing. Apparently their testing program needs a major makeover and the department head should be fired.  How can a company make any profit if it is shipping print heads and ink cartridges to all its customers.  I would also urge Amazon and other retailers to stop selling products with known issues.<br /><br />Updated Dec 2011 - Printer lies idle since it fails to perform the basic function i.e. print.  I will NEVER buy a Lexmark product ever again.<br /><br />Updated April 2012 - Mustered up enough time on a Sunday to follow up again with Lexmark since kids and wife are bugging me about the printer that does not work and having to go yo kinko's to get homework assignments printed.  First call got disconnected after 6 min.  The spoke to Jana who after much coaxing agreed to ship me a new printer.  As of now printer is in the mail.

Let's say you have an important business document that you need to print, scan and email.  Let's say that it is in black and white.  Let's say you run out of yellow ink.  Epson has determined that until you buy their expensive and tiny capacity ink cartridges again, you cannot print with black ink, you cannot scan, you cannot do anything.  The entire printer / scanner / copier is useless.<br /><br />Also, Epson goes through great lengths to deny you choice in ink cartridges.  They revamp the design of them every couple of years, changing absolutely nothing to benefit the customer, but just to make sure that generic print cartridges cannot be recognized by the printer.<br /><br />I am very suspicious of any company that puts greed ahead of the needs of the customer.  I hope this review is helpful.  There are a lot of other printer companies to choose from.;;1.0;;January 24, 2012;;83;;98;;0.846939

Once again this issue can not be resolved.<br /><br />Since a new printer doesn't cost much more then more new ink and I don't want to go the hassle of packing up and taking the printer to a UPS location I'm just going to dump it in the trash and spend some time researching a new printer today.<br /><br />Do to the lack of help I received from Epson I am not going to buy another Epson printer but will look at Hewlett Packard and Cannon.<br /><br />At this point I will forget about printing on CDs (the reason that I selected this printer to start with) until someone else makes a printer that will do so.<br /><br />This printer was worse then useless and so was Epson support.

Other than that, the printer is working great.  I really appreciate the speed.  It's actually faster than the printer I use at work.<br /><br />I had some issues but they were all due to my own incompetence.  The following are some things that slowed down my installation and first print:<br /><br />1.  This printer does not come with a USB cable.  You'll need one, even if you're going wireless.  The standard printer-to-PC cable should work.<br /><br />2.  For a wired setup, the USB connection on the printer is the one on the bottom.  If you're working in low light or can't decipher the little symbols, you might put it in the wrong one.  It will fit, but you won't be connected.<br /><br />3.  Install the duplexing tray even if you won't be duplexing (printing on both sides of the paper).  The paper feeds through that tray.  You should hear a snap. The printer won't print unless this tray is firmly in place.<br /><br />4.  Push the paper load as far back as it will go.  It goes back farther than you might be accustomed to loading.  You'll have about four inches of empty space at the front of the tray.<br /><br />5.  After installing the print heads (a first for me and kinda scary), gently but firmly push down on the light blue plastic piece (it looks like a wishbone) over the print heads.  This piece looks a bit delicate so I was hesitant to push on it.  The printer cover closes fine with that piece left up, but the printer won't work unless that blue piece is pushed down firmly over the print heads.<br /><br />6.  If you get a paper jam, even if you see the jammed paper from the front of the machine, don't pull it out -- REMOVE IT FROM THE BACK.  You'll need to take off the duplexing unit, but it snaps in and out easily.;;4.0;;November 23, 2010;;17;;17;;1.0

The original printer we received worked great for about a week until it started making strange noises and the internal components starting rubbing together, causing the printer to think it was out of paper.  I returned the printer to Amazon and they sent me a new one.  The second printer came and within three weeks had started showing the same symptoms as the previous one.  As the primary tech, I had to wait a week so my schedule afforded me time to deal with the printer which apparently put it outside of the return time frame from Amazon.  So I called HP and they had no idea what was wrong with it.<br /><br />Honestly,my research group has less than 10 users and we have a B&W laser printer to handle the bulk load of our printing!  This printer cannot handle 10 pages a day let alone the amount they say it will handle. Avoid this printer like the plague, it will only bring you misery and the ink consumption and quality is nowhere near as good as they tell you.<br /><br />UPDATE: After about a month of not wanting to deal with the printer, I turned it back on and it would print albeit very slowly and not reliably.  After 2 weeks, it decided to no longer work anymore again. Now it's an oversized paperweight.  Needless to say, as a person who has been working professionally with technology for >5 years now, this is ridiculous. Next time, I'll buy an Epson.;;1.0;;September 15, 2010;;5;;6;;0.833333

I think it's fantastic. One of my measures for a great product is how easy it is to get going and use. The Pogo is very easy to use and works just as advertised.<br /><br />From cellphones, it seems that any phone that can send an image using Bluetooth will probably be able to use the Pogo. Just perform a Bluetooth search, type in the provided code and you're connected. The image is sent as a file to the Pogo, you wait about 30 seconds, and the image slowly rolls out.<br /><br />I also printed from my mid-range Canon camera using a USB cable and it was even easier. Just select the image on the camera and press the print button on the back of the camera. I know simpler cameras may not have a print button, but as long at they support the PICT bridge standard, they probably have some kind of menu option to print.<br /><br />Much has been said about the quality of the pictures. They aren't perfect and I found that close up images print more clearly than distant pictures, which are quite grainy. But frankly, one has to look at what this product is aimed at. I see it as a fun product to take along to social functions where one can quickly capture the moment and hand out a photo or two for the participants to keep. If you want great prints, go use something else.<br /><br />The non-support of the iPhone is a pity (I have an iPhone), but I'm pretty sure that's an iPhone issue, not the Pogo. Phones that do not let one send photos using Bluetooth can't work with the Pogo. Neither the iPhone, nor the Sidekick LX allow that, so don't blame the Pogo!<br /><br />So, considering how much I enjoy the Pogo, why only 4 stars? Well, the prints are quite pricey at 30c to 45c each and they're a bit small. The battery life is OK, but not great meaning you have to recharge the batteries approximately every 5-7 prints. Maybe you can get 10 prints out of a charge (there are 10 prints in each print pack from Polaroid).<br /><br />But, there is no doubt, I'd recommend this as a great family gift. Well done to Polaroid. I look forward to future versions...;;4.0;;November 22, 2008;;9;;11;;0.818182

First of all, instead of printing the text and images in a lighter grey color, it prints with a large dot pattern that doesn't look good. Also, sometimes, when using Economode, it will print the text with the lighter dot pattern but the white areas of the sheet will turn out grey?! Where are the savings there? Also, I tried making my documents a light grey on my computer to save on ink, but the printer will print it several shades darker. It seems like this printer is specifically designed to waste ink.<br /><br />The double-sided printing comes in very handy however. The printer also works well on the network. Didn't have any problems setting it up there. And it does print envelopes and index cards, although, if you need to print both sides of the index card, you have to manually re-insert the card into the printing tray.;;3.0;;April 5, 2011;;6;;7;;0.857143

I run a small company with 16 employees.  There are 3 of us in the office that will use this machine.  I was hoping to replace my Dell Multi Function Color Laser machine but it is not going to cut it.  First of all the machine prints very well and the printing speed is very good. Paper capacity is also very good. The fax portion of this product also works very well.  The drawback is that it copies very slow and also the receiving tray for the printed documents is very flimsy. If you print a large document you will find paper all over the floor as the receiving try holds less than 50 pages I would say.  Also, there is a software glitch.  The machine wants to print everything in reverse order even when you tell it not to.  This occured with several differnt versions of Windows.  So my conclusion is that this is not an office capable type of machine.  I would say it is great for home based business use.;;3.0;;December 30, 2011;;6;;8;;0.75

We do very little faxing, but some of our contacts require fax communication, so we probably average about 200 sheets a year.<br />Overall, this machine has many excellent features - reading all the document sheets into memory before dialling, for example, and providing a "starter" cartridge that is good for 1500 sheets.  There are, however, a couple of gripes.  First of all, this is the second machine we bought: the document feed on the first one didn't work - the rollers rotated, but wouldn't pick up the paper.  I am SO impressed with Amazon - I submitted a return on Sunday evening, and a new machine was delivered on Tuesday.  The new one works fine.<br />Gripe #2 - I frequently have to send faxes to a credit bureau, whose fax line is often busy.  The redial function is only good for one attempt, after 5 minutes.  I don't want to have to get up every five minutes to retry manually - even the 10-year old Panasonic redialled every minute until it either got through or you told it to stop.<br />Gripe #3.  You have to go through a 4- or 5- step process to change the receive mode.  I only want the machine to be on Fax mode when I know a fax is coming in.  Other times, it can be on Telephone mode.  (Actually, there is a simple solution - just power it off)<br />Gripe #4.  No Caller ID on the fax machine, and even in Telephone mode, it has to intercept the ring tone to let me know it's a phone call.  That means that my 2nd-line portable phone doesn't get the Caller ID signal either.  Not a big deal, because nobody except for random callers calls that number, but if you only have one line, you can kiss Caller ID goodbye.<br />Overall, however, a good machine for what I hope are the dying days for this technology.;;4.0;;April 30, 2006;;28;;30;;0.933333

Wide format: I do a lot of 13x19 and 11x17 printing. A wide format printer was a necessity for me. There are about a dozen or so wide format printers on the market (or is it large format, with wide format being 24" or wider? I forgot). Epson has always made a good wide format printer. This is now my 3rd model over 11 years.<br /><br />2. Price: The price is always important to me. This cost me under $300 and for a wide format printer with these specs, an excellent value.<br /><br />3. Separate color ink cartridges: I print a lot of blue and black in my work, so it's important to be able to replace these colors frequently without having to replace the entire color cartridge. This will save me money.<br /><br />4. Print quality: I need a printer that is going to give me exceptional print quality. The highest print quality setting gives me what I am looking for. The colors are stunning.<br /><br />5. Paper: I love Epson's premium luster line of papers. They are gorgeous. I always buy Epson's brand of papers and have a stock of various sizes.<br /><br />Things not important to me: speed wireless printing. I would have connected the printer to my print server (which is also wireless). The built-in wireless saved me the hassle (and my print server is a hassle when I add a new printer to it). The speed is fine, and I didn't notice any slow-down when printing wirelessly versus via USB.<br /><br />I am not saying that speed and wireless printing are not important, they are just not important for me. I am of the mind that you can't have it all, and that in high-end graphic arts printing, you almost always sacrifice speed for quality.<br /><br />If I were able to remove a half star it would be for not including a small assortment of paper samples. It was always a nice surprise to open that in any new printer, almost like the toy in Cracker Jacks. Don't be cheap Epson!!!<br /><br />I highly recommend this printer, and with it, Epson premium luster papers. You won't be disappointed.;;5.0;;May 20, 2012;;5;;6;;0.833333

I've owned perhaps 25 printers over the last few decades, and this one is by far the most unreliable. Sure, it will give you a nice-quality 11 x 17 print--if you have 45 mintues to stand over it, fiddling, refeeding the paper time and time again, and praying to a Deity of your choice (and I'm not religious).<br />If this delicate, irritable, hypersensitive printer detects even the slightest thing it doesn't like (even if you are fortunate enough to place the paper on the 11 x 17 line with a precision that would put a Swiss watchmaker to shame), such as having two sheets too many, or two sheets too few (it seems to prefer around 21 sheets at last count), or even looking at it in a way it deems disrespectful, you'll get the dreading blinking yellow light from hell and a loud beep informing you that you have a "paper jam" (which you don't). Guaranteed to have you on the edge of a cerbral infarction within 10 minutes (I should mention that I have two teenaged sons, and they seem docile and compliant compared to this printer).<br />Don't get me wrong--I've had high-maintenance printers before, from all the major manufacturers, but this one is by far the most infuriating. Ideally you'd have to hire a full-time employee to get it to print three jobs a day. If I didn't need it so much, I would have attached it to the back of my car and taken it for a long drive long ago.<br />I hope this will keep some poor soul from wasting his or her hard-earned cash on this loser. Definitely an epic failure--is there a way to rate something negative five stars?;;1.0;;December 16, 2009;;51;;60;;0.85

The drawback, however, is that printing from either InDesign or Photoshop (on a Mac) results in really dark prints. Not "kinda dark" but too dark to be usable. Yesterday, I spent about a half-hour on the phone with HP tech support. After telling me "it's not a photo printer so don't expect much" we tried a number of different advanced settings in Photoshop to no avail. The quality of the prints--once I lightened them up substantially using Photoshop--is great. But I can't "fix" everything by hand to accommodate the printer. InDesign, same story. There is no printer profile available for this printer; according to the tech support guy at HP, he didn't expect one to be developed either.

Did I mention amazing?;;I have to say this little bugger surprised me.<br /><br />I'm a huge tech geek.  I love everything to do with gadgets, computers, electronics in general, and all that good stuff.  I also have a tendency to be on the run a lot, or at work and wanting to print something at home.  So in the past I'd painstakingly, if out or at work, VPN into my home computer, pull up a document which I emailed to myself, and then print it, log out, and then it'd be waiting for me when I got home.  Either that or if it was something the wife needed I'd send it to her, and she'd print it and so forth.  The second isn't a big deal, but wouldn't it be much nicer to just shoot the document straight to the printer?<br /><br />In addition my previous printer, a Canon, was an ink hog.  This wouldn't be a huge deal if it was just documents, but I also have two kids and a bit of a photography addiction.  So anytime we go somewhere I normally lug the DSLR bag w/ me, and snap a bunch of pics.  Then go home and edit them.  A lot of the time we want to print them as well.  On the Canon this would DESTROY my ink cartridges, and they were pricey!<br /><br />After testing a Kodak printer in the past I decided to look into their current series, and was beyond excited that the 3.1 was receiving such praise.  I picked it up, and couldn't be happier.<br /><br />You have all the tech geekyness you desire with cloud printing, WiFi N support, Kodak app for my iPhone to print photo's from it.<br /><br />What surprised me was the color reproduction, overall quality, and most of all... ink management.<br /><br />Printing like crazy we found it was holding up better than any printer I previously have had.  Even with tons of photo's being printed, and regular documents, I was getting a huge leap in ink management.  On top of that, though, it looked amazing.  My colors were extremely solid, sharp, and I wasn't seeing spots or bleed!  This print is under 100b bucks, right?  Because it doesn't behave like a budget printer.<br /><br />If you're away from home often then cloud printing is for you.  If you love to print family photo's then this printer is for you.  If you want small, cheap, and inexpensive... then this printer is for you.  I've recommended it to at least a dozen family/friends, and I'll recommend it to you too!<br /><br />There's lots of other stuff we could discuss, but honestly read the reviews and you'll see.

Recommend you order the high capacity replacement toner cartridges when you order the printer.  Save yourself the trouble later on.  Toner prices for this printer are lower than most.;;5.0;;August 18, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

Setting it up with my Mac was super simple, although getting it set up on my network for wireless printing was not quite so straight forward. However, a video on youtube told me what to do, step by step. I have mainly used the printer for light printing needs, and it has worked great. The only negative is that the paper tray must remain open if there is paper in it, in otherwords, there is no contained paper drawer.;;5.0;;November 25, 2011;;6;;6;;1.0

I was a previous Kodak printer owner and pleased with the former printer capabilities.  Love the clean lines of this unit...other printers I chose from were dinosaurs: huge, cumbersome, and take up a large footprint of space.  This is far more compact, and I love that about it.  Needed a printer that print photos as well, and this one has a separate tray for print stock.  No one can beat Kodak on color prints.  Did not need the "autofeed copy feature" and that adds quite a bit to the size of a printer.  Wasn't expecting touchscreen capabilities so was pleased it includes that feature.  Decided against HP printers as their toners are like rebuying the printer each time you need to replace cartridges ($$$).  While you do have to buy toner cartridges more often, I typically print daily docs in blacktone, saving the color for photo printing.  Color copies and photos can't be matched by the other brands.  Did have a bit of trouble setting it up for wireless printing (WiFi) via AT&T U-Verse with the enclosed DVD but simply visited the Kodak website and downloaded the driver/files from their website. Wouldn't change a thing about the new printer - Love It!;;5.0;;December 14, 2011;;19;;19;;1.0

I immediately experienced a drastic drop in printing speed. The print language is HP JetReady 4.2, which is a host-based language. HP seems to have removed the processing power to reduce costs on these low-end printers and placed the burden on the users computer. I am running OSX 10.4.11 on a G4 PPC tower and printing to this printer is unacceptable. It takes 1 hours to print a 24-page document from InDesign and 9 minutes to print a 1 page Illustrator doc that contains only text. Also you surrender the computer while this processing takes place. It is like not having a print spooler function.<br /><br />You also have to put up with the very light and contrasty color from the new toners. This can be tweaked out by cranking every color control from the panel ( plus two for all colors and all shades.) I suspect that the amount of toner used per page will correspondingly go up resulting in high consumable costs.<br /><br />It was mistake on my part in buying this printer. The correct choice for a unit with comparable duty cycle and features but with a processor is the CP3505. Compare and contrast the two printers at HP web site and you will see that a lot of features are obtained for a small increase in price.<br /><br />Thank goodness that my supplier allowed me to return this printer.<br /><br />Think long and hard before buying any model HP laser printer with host based processing.;;1.0;;July 15, 2008;;24;;31;;0.774194

Setting it up is typical, lots of little easy to remove tape holding the trays and such together, then installing the print head and ink, all very straight forward.<br /><br />Next you need to decide how you plan to connect it to your computer or network. The easiest option is though the USB port, Cable not included. The good news is the Wi-Fi is easy enough to set-up. From opening the box to loading drivers and tools from the CD to printing was under 20 minutes I'd say.<br /><br />First thing was the test page, that is a little scary, I was using just plain generic paper and it looked pretty dull. Once the printer was configured I printed various things a draft, normal, and best, and was very happy with all, draft is good enough for all but very high detail stuff unless it is photo's and I don't print many photo's, the ones I did on the Kodak paper were literally stunning.<br /><br />Given that draft is usually suitable, the print speed is great, at normal it is acceptable, and at best the speed is marginal, but still good for the price. I don't have a good rule for photo print speed, seemed slow to me, but my last printer did not do photo's officially so no real reference, but will say again how impressed I was at the quality, as good as anything I have had printed at a photo shop.<br /><br />The copier with auto-sheet feed is really nice, reducing the scan and print to one step is a bigger plus than it may sound, no need to fire up a word processor or PDF reader, no need to scan to a file and then print the file, nope, just like at work, set your stack of stuff to copy in the try and hit start. Copy speed was very good.<br /><br />The flatbed scanner worked well also and was faster than the stand-alone scanner I replaced with this all-in-one, and scan detail was just as good, I scanned in some detailed Visio drawings and scanned them to PDF using their tools, very nice feature! The Fax is a fax, it works fine.<br /><br />The footprint on the PC is also very light, perhaps one of the best I have seen, the tools are just right to get a little extra out of the printer but other than the scan to PDF, nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I loaded the drivers and tools on 2 XP boxes and a Win7 system, no issues on any. I also liked how it reached out for the latest from Kodak as part of the install and that it was optional.<br /><br />So far so good, I had always figured that an all-in-one was a compromise of all of the functions, but at least for my use this performs as a printer, copier, scanner, and Fax as well as any of the individual devices this replaced.<br /><br />Final note, I got an ink pack after seeing some reviews about it using a lot of ink, well I was surprised at how cheap the ink was compared to what I used to pay, and at least in my short experience I am still showing plenty of ink in the carts that shipped with the printer.<br /><br />What's great about it: Fast Printing/Copying, Great Feature Mix, Easy Install<br /><br />What's not so great: Little noisy compared to last printer.;;5.0;;February 24, 2011;;13;;13;;1.0

It was very easy to set up with a set of cartridges included. The text and photo print quality ranges from very good to excellent. Those with bad results may not be choosing the right paper settings. Also good software can make a difference. I experimented with different papers, different settings and different software to get better results. Compared to my old Epson this printer has the following advantages:<br /><br />1.) Ink lasts longer. The Epson ran out of ink within 2 weeks with moderate printing of a few high resolution photos and about 50-100 pages of black text. The Canon IP2702 can print at least 50% more. Sometimes, with moderate printing, I've not had to change a cartridge for a month or more. That's because I use the 'fast' mode most of the time which saves ink.<br /><br />2.) When ink runs out you only have 2 cartridges to replace (1 black and 1 color). On the other hand, the Epson had 6 cartridges which seemed to run out rapidly. As a result the ink cost was outrageous for the Epson.<br /><br />3.) The Epson would sometimes print half a page or less during a print job and suddenly stop working until I changed the ink. So far the Canon has not done this. It has, however, warned me when the ink was low. Also occasionally Canon printouts will get lighter when ink is low. As soon as you replace the cartridge the prints are back to normal.<br /><br />4.) The Epson's draft mode (to save ink) printed so light that text could barely be seen. The ink saving 'fast' mode on the Canon is quite good and saves ink. The print on fast mode is noticeably lighter but clear and readable. In normal print modes both the Canon and Epson print beautiful laser quality text. Clear, crisp, dark and very readable.<br /><br />5.) The Canon is reliable. Occasionally it stops in the middle of a job for about 30 seconds and then resumes. Epson on the other hand was very moody. It constantly required head cleaning even after only 40-50 pages. Also the paper jams on the Epson were annoying. So far the Canon has not had paper jams.<br /><br />In summary I'm glad my Epson finally broke. This enabled me to get a better printer that's much more reliable and won't suddenly quit in the middle of a print job. I'm not saying the ink is inexpensive for the Canon cause it's not. Ink cost is one of the biggest ripoffs in America. However, Canon ink is much cheaper than the Epson which was obviously programmed to take (or steal?) your money. When the Epson worked correctly, which was less than 50% of the time, the high resolution photo prints were perfect. Canon prints are also very good to excellent but only with the right settings, right paper and good software. I was very happy to say goodbye Epson (forever) and hello Canon.;;5.0;;June 13, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

This is my second Brother MFC. This one is generation 3. My original Brother MFC lasted about 5 years. I hope they worked out the bugs out of this one. It works just as good at the original one but it's one does 32ppm and have more built in memory. My 1st gen has scanner lock issues and ADF started giving me issues. The high yield toner is TN-650 (8000 pages). It's expensive toner but it lasts very long for the toner. It's toner is also bigger than many other printers. Check that out if the price is what you need in features before buying. I was hoping Amazon sold it when I was buying it so I could have purchased it from Amazon.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The best ADF that I have seen for a while.<br />  - Doesn't jam much.<br />- Features. I looked at HP, Sharp, Canon, Lexmark, Minolta and can't find any printer that comes close to the features and abilities of this printer. Too features much to list, read Brother's website. Even supports Postscript, pdf.<br />- Legal size glass scanning is a big big plus. Many printer nowadays only does letter size or needs to the document to go thru the ADF (top feeder tray).<br />- Paper tray can adjust from Letter to Legal size<br />- fax is just a button away (Save phone number setup).<br />- Energy Star rated (not like gen 1 where your lights flicker when you turn it on). This issue appears to be fixed.<br />- DN = Duplex (2 sided printing) and network printing (if you have DHCP, just plug and play, no setup on printer really needed).<br />- Extremely fast printing (Thinking of replacing my other printers with is one).<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Can't find how to copy 2 sided using Legal sized paper so I have to do 1 page at a time either with the ADF or glasstop.<br />- The date and time doesn't save at all and reverts to 1/1/2010 when power is turned off after use. *(fixed with new firmware update)*<br />- Duplex mode is confusing to use at times. Copying 1 -> 2 is not simple, needs time to read manual.<br />- Toner pricing for TN-650 is expensive but lasts a long time since it's bigger than some (good for 6,000 pages). It's around $83 at Amazon.com (best price also(<br />- Past experience with customer support is almost null. But all printer companies are similar.;;5.0;;June 21, 2009;;43;;44;;0.977273

I am replacing my beloved Canon i9900 that I have/had used for a little over five years and had never had to take it in for a single repair until a few weeks ago and was told it needed a new Print Head, and my husband opted to buy a new one rather than have the i9900 repaired because he was afraid something else would "go out" on it and he would have to have more repairs done. But though I like this one, some things I liked better on my old Canon. There is a problem (it is a problem to me, maybe others have figured out a way to overcome it) but the colors print out too dark and color seems too saturated when I print personal photos from the computer. I have went into the area where I thought I would be able to control the colors, but it was not simple for me to do and not being a professional photographer (as so many of the other reviewers that I have read reviews from here claim to be) I do not know how nor what place to go to change the quality or the tone, whatever it is that I need to change. The colors are too dark, I need to lighten up skin tones, etc.and I think maybe better contrast.  When I still had the i9900, which I did right after Christmas this past year (2009 and early 2010) I had a lot of picures that I had taken of my family at Christmas and it was very easy to adjust color on it and lighten the skin tones when the picture was too dark. I know this is painting me as a rank amateur and that is exactly what I am but I have been printing photographs on my printers for years and they were fine and now all of a sudden, I buy a new printer, just an updated version of my old one and should be as good, and probably would be if I could just figure out how to get the color printing for the photos to look better. It is fine for everyday printing of text and so on, but then, I could have bought a small fifty or sixty dollar printer to do that. I have an HP photo printer that still works fine but after I bought the i9900 I just stopped using the HP because the Canon was easier to use, I liked the ease of printing on the Canon as opposed to the HP, the paper loading was easier and the controls easier to get to, etc., but the print quality was almost as good on the HP as on the i9900 but it was easier for me to stick to one or the other so I chose to stick with the Canon. But I am not quite as pleased with the new Canon Pro9000. I was expecting so much more from it after reading the glowing reviews here that made it sound like the quality would be drastically improved with this new one but that has not been the case. I have to get this color corrected! Can anyone out there help me? Any advice or suggestions?  Thanks.<br /><br />Alphia D. Larkins<br />Acworth, Georgia;;5.0;;April 27, 2010;;4;;5;;0.8

It was a workhorse and always gave me crisp, fast, color, and it was wonderfully efficiency on inkjet replacement costs--I mean really, really great. After 10 years of mega use though, sadly, the old boy was on his last legs, and  it was finally time to let him rest in peace. So, having had great luck and satisfaction with that old man, and the Epson printers before him, I, of course, went straight back to Epson family of products to choose my new partner inn printing. After shopping, researching, and reviewing all my options, I settled on the R2000 Artisan Inkjet. I paid a little over $500 with a $100 mail-in rebate.<br /><br />Set up was simple enough. I bought the printer directly from Epson, and it came with the drivers, manual,  and wireless set-up software on a CD-Rom. I popped in a USB, connected it to my Mac, and initialized the wireless set up. I was courteously redirected to download everything I needed to set up the wireless network from the internet, so there was not even a need for the CD, other than to have it as a back-up. Set up was simple and went smoothly--no problems at all there. However, there were other problems almost immediately.<br /><br /> The ink supply levels for the printer appeared to be inaccurate, so after only printing about 100 pages, the printer stopped working and asked for more juice...ALREADY?! Fine. I had ordered extra ink cartridges, and I replaced the low ink, although oddly, it was the cartridge for the "clear" optimizer slot. After I replaced the cartridge and change the printer setting to "low optimization" so it wouldn't drink so much color optimizer. The printer was ready to go again, but not for long. After one day, the indicator light to replace another cartridge (black) came on. I replaced the black ink. Finally, on the road, I thought. Not so much.<br /><br />Though I changed the cartridges, the supply levels never went all the way back up to full. So, either the cartridges aren't full to begin with, or the supply level sensors are wacked. I reinitialized all printer settings to (hopefully) restore proper levels. They went up, but not where they should be for new cartridges. I started printing on "Economy" mode to say ink on draft prints, but "Economy" gives only a faint gray image (looks worse than even a dot-matrix printer). BUT, sadly, after that, even on "regular" mode, the print quality just went downhill. Dull, muted colors, listless looking graphics, muddy type faces (not crisp and clean), and the edges of each sheet of paper started getting "skid marks" from where the paper was being pulled into the printer. Cleaning the rollers has not had much impact on NOW this new issue, either.<br /><br />With very, very pricey inkjet carts averaging around $70 dollars to replace,--and there are EIGHT carts--I could potentially end up spending $100-150 a month on ink. At that rate, within a year, I could have bought a $1000 printer and probably gotten much more mileage. I am not sure what to do with the damn thing now since I waited over a month to set it up after I got it (didn't want to say good-bye to my 1280), and now the 60-day return period is over. I would send the pile of plastic straight back to Epson if I could because I simply should NOT have this much trouble after only the most minimal of work that this printer has done.This printer now sits on the floor by the edge of the wall as a piece of office flotsam  taking up space in the corner of the room. I'm somewhat resigned to just having it be a lame, emergency back-up printer--but right now, it can't even be that since the printer jams every time a sheet of paper tries to load into the printer.<br /><br />Well, let me tell you something, Mr. R2000. You've been unfaithful to my marriage with the Epson family, and you broke my heart. I feel like I've been cheated on!  Dearest, Epson, how could you let him do it?  How could you let me down like this? You had me believing that my romance with the R2000 would be just as good as the Epson's I've loved before!  I put my faith in your R2000, and he took my love--and my MONEY--and ran. Well, our romance is now over--once bitten, twice shy. After all these years! Oh, breaking up is hard to do!<br /><br />Other people seem infatuated with the R2000. Maybe the R2000 just has them fooled, or maybe I simply got a lemon this time.  I'll be OK. I've gotta new guy now. I bought another printer from a different manufacturer at a sweet price, and he satisfies my every need. But I'm still sad I've had to break off my relationship with Epson. They were wonderful years, and it was good while it lasted. Maybe we'll meet again some day. For now, I somberly raise a cup of coffee, gaze at at the R2000 piled in the corner, and say with a sigh,  "Here's lookin' at you, kid.";;2.0;;April 10, 2012;;27;;34;;0.794118

The old HP ran like a champ, but I could not pass up the chance to move to color.<br /><br />Setup was a breeze over my ethernet using my old Mac running Leopard. I rated the documentation as good, as I only used the quick set up guide and did not dig into the details, but the manual looks comprehensive. I did (and suggest) to skip the enclosed driver CD and go right to HP.com and get the latest drivers and firmware. This made the printer work with Apple's new airprint. I can print from my iPad and iPhone via my home wireless network. I didn't even have to set up the wireless printing on the printer.

(I called the company directly, Brother, and they confirmed that this is how the printer functions.)  The reset/cleaning, whatever you want to call it, takes about 40 seconds.  So, if you are copying 5 different pages out of a book, for example, the printer does a 40 second reset after EACH copy, making your 5 page copy job- about 5 minutes long.

Before returning the Brother I purchased a Canon MF8380CDW. I did side by side comparisons of the print quality and there is no doubt the Canon produces much better output. I did have to tweak one setting in the printer driver to get the best result (under the Quality section, set Halftones to Resolution), but this was only to improve light gray scale reproduction. The clarity of text and images is much better than the Brother regardless of the driver settings. The Canon is also a bit smaller, quieter, and doesn't flicker the lights in my office like the Brother did. I have not had any jams with the Canon, but I haven't printed envelopes with it yet. The only weakness of the Canon compared to the brother is the user interface. The Brother's user interface is definitely better, but I was able to get the Canon up and running without difficulty. I'm happy with the Canon.<br /><br />One reviewer complained about the black text being a little light. I agree. However, you can fix this in the printer driver (on a Mac, anyway) by going into the quality settings, select advanced, and move the Black slider to darken it up (I went to +3). Combined with the halftone setting I mentioned above, I am now getting very excellent quality output from this unit. Prior to these tweaks, it was still much better than the Brother. I knocked off one star for the obtuse user interface.;;4.0;;December 14, 2011;;60;;60;;1.0

It prints reliably and with good results. The duplexing works great on regular paper.<br /><br />But... if you want to do anything unusual it's not the best. Special papers, manual feed, etc are all very difficult on this printer.<br /><br />The manual feed is a single-sheet loader, so you have to send print jobs one page at a time or it will take the first sheet from the loader and the next from the tray. Furthermore, it will not accept a second sheet until the first one has fully printed and the printer has gone through the cool off routine about ten seconds later. It takes FOREVER. The loader is also difficult to use, it only has feed tabs at the edges so it's hard to get the paper positioned flat enough for it to feed in properly.<br /><br />It will handle single-sided jobs on cardstock from the normal tray or manual feed, but not in duplexing mode. When it stashes away the paper to flip sides it gets stuck. You also have to open the back sometimes because it has a hard time making the cornder to come out to the output stacker.<br /><br />*** That all said... here's the kicker: The toner cartridges cost $80 for regular yield, and more than $100 for high yield, PER COLOR and they're good for 500 sheets of text if you're lucky (FAR less than that if you're printing images, logos, etc). You can not trust the 2500 page per cartridge estimate. The total page count on my printer is still less than 1000 pages, and I have replaced all of the cartridges at least once, some of them twice already. (I have printed mostly text and maybe ~250 pages of full color). It comes with full-duty cartridges instead of baby starters which is a near-miracle nowadays, but as a result it is literally cheaper to run the printer until the ink is gone, throw it away and buy a new printer. Oh, and this is one of those printers that tracks the toner cartridge by the electronic chip inside so once it thinks the cartridge is dead it will never print from it again. With many other printers, if there's still toner left, when it gets low you can rotate the cartridge and put it back in with good results until it's truly empty, but not with this printer).<br /><br />Yes ink and toner is the biggest ripoff racket in the history of the industrial age, that's nothing new. But toner for this printer is, at minimum, twice as expensive per page as any other printer I've owned. And it's not plentiful on the market, so price competition and alternate sourcing (such as ebay) is limited. With a run-of-the-mill HP printer you're usually assured that cheap toner will be available, but not with this printer, it's too much of a fringe unit to generate that kind of alternate toner market.<br /><br />In short: Great printer for plain old printing with no special needs, but ridiculously expensive to operate.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />One additional issue worth mentioning... this printer has no control for the display contrast, which has become a problem for me. Having recently moved, I now have this printer on top of a filing cabinet. From the shallow angle I can not read the display--it shows all black boxes where the characters are, so I have to get up on a stool to view the messages from above. Most adjustable LCD  screens can accommodate various viewing angles like this situation by changing display contrast, this printer lacks that setting.;;3.0;;September 13, 2011;;6;;6;;1.0

The charger is slightly smaller than the actual printer and you cant charge and print at the same time, it will create an error that the battery is too low.<br /><br />The image quality is OK, the blacks are VERY black and you will likely lose all detail in the shades.

After much research I have eagerly awaited the release of Epson's newest printer. Set up with my PC was a snap - no brainer here. Before my first print, I calibrated my monitor with the Spyder system which I also highly recommend. I've printed with both Photoshop and Lightroom. From the very first print.....my colors have been right on the money. In fact, as good as any professional online service I've used. The images are simply astonishing.<br /><br />I'm using currently Epson paper only, mostly their Velvet Fine Art paper. I have not yet found a need to run a calibration profile on Epson paper. The download paper profiles from Epson appear to be working well. Although I will probably do a test run to see if there is a significant difference. I'm looking forward to trying Red River Paper as well.<br /><br />I've never done any high-end printing before. I always used on an online print service, but was frustrated with my lack of control over the process. Using a printer of this caliber can be a little overwhelming with Photoshop/Lightroom. It is critical to get your color management issues squared away before hand. It was very helpful to read: The Art of Printing Photos on Your Epson Printer - by Michael Freeman and John Beardsworth which was published earlier this year. This book was enlightening and it made my software/hardware choices much easier.<br /><br />If you are tired of letting others have the final control over your very best images, are comfortable in PS or LR, utilize monitor calibration, can justify the expense, use higher end camera gear and enjoy the entire creative process that photography entails.....this is the printer you have been waiting for.;;5.0;;December 12, 2009;;69;;72;;0.958333

But I needed to print 300 DVDs and the labels just are too cumbersome to use.  So I got the printer.  It has worked quite well out of the box, I'm on DVD #280 now and printing over the past 3 weeks with no problems.<br />  The printer is very noisy when it starts up, however during printing it is fine.  It seems to go a long way on ink - I am just now changing out the regular capacity cartridges the unit came with, with a full size DVD pastel image and printing.  I probably could have stretched and done all 300 on the originals but didn't want to lose any DVD's due to ink failure.<br />  The DVD slot works well - prints in about 3 minutes (burning my DVD takes 6 so it works out fine).  Inserting the DVD slot makes you think you are damaging the unit, but that's the way it is designed. Seems like a strange procedure to power up the unit - pull out the DVD tray, put slot back on paper, power it up - wait - listen to the awful noises - then when it settles down, put the DVD tray back in position to go.  When doing a bunch, you only do this once to get started.  This is why I gave it 3* for ease of use.<br />  So bottom line - nice quality, very noisy, but does the job well.  We will see if the ink jams up like the earlier Epsons did to me after some time passes.  Probably wise to print at least 1 sheet a month to keep things clear if not used for awhile.;;4.0;;October 16, 2009;;16;;17;;0.941176

Totally unknown to me prior to study:  AIO or MFC searches will frequently bring up only printer combos that include all 4 functions:  print, copy, scan, and fax.<br /><br />After an extended search produced poor options, I discovered the DCP line which includes 3 of the 4 functions, dropping only the fax.  This one difference from the MFC line meant far faster copy speeds, better quality printing and copying, and generally better quality all around on the 3 functions it performs.<br /><br />The DCP-8080DN can be connected to a computer by USB and other means;  can be networked in a LAN;  will copy as a stand-alone (using ADF or manual feed);  comes with a full-sized toner cartridge (for est. 15,000 pages) rather than the skimpy initial toner with others.  Toner is available in high-yield size that makes cost between 1-2 cents per page, so reasonable consumables.  When added to initial purchase price of $330, the initial and long term costs are manageable.<br /><br />Yes, it is somewhat large but it's proving its value already.  No more need for separate copier.  It's completely silent when not in use and starts up pretty quickly.  When printing, after warm up of maybe 12 seconds, pages pump out at the fastest rate I have ever seen for a small office laser printer.  Seems the specs say 30 ppm, and it seems to be printing @ this rate.  Copy speed is only slightly less fast.  It will copy and print in duplex (2 sided) but speeds are considerably slower than printing/copying 2 separate pages.<br /><br />Scanning is excellent, with capacity to scan to email, and also includes an OCR software Presto Page Manager 7.18, which works well.  We already have a Scansnap for scanning, so we won't use scanning often.<br /><br />Faxing is on the way out, with sheet feed scanning to pdf and emailing sufficing quite nicely.<br /><br />We paid $330 on Amazon, used Prime for free, fast shipping, and it was here in 2 days.  Set-up was fast and easy.  Its Quick Set-Up documentation could serve as a model for other companies.  (What a relief, too!)  Works great with both Apple-Mac and PCs.<br /><br />Brother should do a better job in distinguishing and marketing this DCP line.  I only accidentally bumped into it, yet it offers several models for a range of prices.  Finally, a multi-function printer that does not degrade printing because the unit adds copying and scanning.;;5.0;;January 8, 2010;;98;;98;;1.0

Only two negatives:  (1) To print photos on our computer from the photo tray requires changing settings in a less than obvious way, and finding instructions in HP's online help resources took a long, frustrating search.  (Of course, there's no printed manual.  That's so 20th century.)  (2) We use high capacity (XL) ink cartridges.

We were printing letters that were all in black lettering except for our email which was in blue.  For some reason however all of our ink levels were going down like crazy and we weren't even using those colors or should have been using very little.  We would take the ink cartridges out and touch the sponge tip where the ink came out and it was still very much moist however the printer wouldn't allow us to print if any of the cartridges were "empty".<br /><br />I ended up doing a lot of research and even taking apart one of the ink cartridges. I found that there is a small chip attached to each cartridge that has a small amount of memory to keep track of how many pages are printed with that ink cartridge. Once it reaches a certain number of pages it claims it's empty and needs to be replaced.  When I found this out I was so frustrating since it wasn't actually checking the levels or amount of ink remaining.  So here I was paying for the ink but I couldn't even use it all.<br />And there is no way to reset the chip and refill the cartridges yourself.  It was such a waste of money.  I guess most ink cartridges and printers use this kind of technology but some you can buy a chip re-setter and refill them yourself...which is what I plan on doing.;;1.0;;July 23, 2010;;117;;120;;0.975

First, I wanted a unit that was expected to last more than 2 years.  Second, I wanted affordable copies.  Third, I didn't want to spend more than $150.  I settled for 2 out of 3.  The price was $50 more than I wanted to pay but the black ink cartridges were said to cost $5.99 and be good for 500 b/w copies.  Out of the box, loved it.  Set up was easy.  It took me 30 min to set up 3 computers.  Copies, scans, documents feed, no problems.  The touch panel is similar to the professional units at the print shop.  It's simple to use.  My WIFI has been flawless.  It hibernates and wakes up fine.  I don't have to do a thing but sit at the computer and refill the paper tray as necessary.  The only drawback so far?  I can't figure out if I can set it's preferences on the Mac to only print in b/w.  I have to tell it with each print job to print in b/w.  Oh well, I'll gladly suffer through:>)  Why?  Because I really did buy black ink cartridges for less than $5 each in a package of 4.  Each of those cartridges is supposed to make 500 copies.  Heck, if one cartridge makes half that many I'll still be ahead.;;5.0;;June 28, 2010;;15;;15;;1.0
R1A4OUQ5FO5VG6;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A22TD8QA3JTBP0;;Printer;;B001EHFVOS;;HP CM2320NF Color LaserJet Multifunction Printer;;Great for Small-Business Office;;I was wary of purchasing this product due to the reviews on both Amazon and other sites.  However, I believe that most of the people giving bad reviews to this machine really did not set-up the machine correctly.  If you check out the cnet or pcmag reviews, the Color Laserjet MFPs, both the 1300 and 2300 series are getting editors choices for the combination of speed, ease of use, great looking prints, and quality.  As well as economy, the toner cartridges are a tad expensive, but buy the black one in a double pack (like getting the second 75% off) as you will go through this quickly.  The color ones last a surprisingly long time.<br /><br />With a correct set-up this has been the best recent purchase our office has made.  The scan to email feature is the best.  Even a novice can scan to their email now.  Saves many headaches or formatting, saving, configuring, etc... in either Adobe or the software that comes with the printer.  And no, there is no way to get authentication to work.  But, there is a great workaround that not many people know about.  Try your ISPs smtp server.  As you are on the network already, many ISPs (Optimum for example) have a non authenticated "mail.optonline.net" smtp server that any customer may use.  For this purpose, it is also incredibly quick with the upload speeds and makes for a very easy scan to email.  For the most part, if you are using an authenticated outside source for your mail, you might be able to take advantage of this.  If you use internal email sources, and cant figure out how to get it to work on your server, maybe you should not be configuring your own server then.<br /><br />Overall, another feature that is handy is the fax mechanism.  This MFP scans your entire fax in first, then tries to send it all at once.  I had a 7400 series Officejet (about the same price as this laser a few years ago) that had the worst fax machine in it.  It would error in the middle of scanning the pages in, making situations where the other party gets 2 out of 4 pages and then you have to send everything over again.  Regardless, the fax on this machine is very well set-up by hp.<br /><br />Copy is fast, the glass for the copy machine is small - only letter size instead of legal size, but the machine is too narrow to get legal size copies in anyway.<br /><br />The paper handling is superb as well.  The inclusion of the manual feed bypass on front makes printing items such as quickbooks checks, forms, preprinted letterhead, etc... a simple and easy task.  Very well thought out design in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall very good printer.  I give it 4 stars for one reason alone, the toner cartridges are expensive at a yield of 3500-2800 pages for an hp business laser.  The more expensive next model CM3500s get around 7000 pages yield out of one cartridge for the same price.  But overall, the machinery is great for the volume of about 6-8000 sheets per month we print.<br /><br />Also - HP has a promotion where you trade in an old printer (any model, and manufacturer, doenst have to work) and get $150 off this printer by mail in rebate.  Makes this a really great deal in my opinion.;;4.0;;April 4, 2009;;28;;30;;0.933333

All-in-one capabilities (document print/copy/scan/fax) - This printer does all of these very well for me.  There is no built-in fax, but I do not have a land phone-line in the house.  I can accomplish the fax function by using the scanner, then using an on-line service to fax.  This may or may not be acceptable to you, but I knew this going into the purchase and am fine with this approach.<br /><br />2.  "Closing the Loop" on digital photography - over the last few years, I have become a serious amateur digital photographer.  In general, I do not think that printing at home is more cost effective than using a local lab or on-line service to get prints (and what I have seen of ink consumption for this printer so far has reenforced this belief).  I also do not expect to be able to match the output quality of the pros at my local camera shop.  That said, the photo printing capabilities of this printer do allow me to match the quality of the local Walgreens for prints up to 8x10.  And most importantly, for a very low price has enabled me to learn a great deal about color correction, print resolutions, etc.  The immediate feedback provided by the high-quality prints from this printer has allowed me to experiment in near real-time and has really helped me improve my overall photography.  For the few pictures I take that I will want the very highest quaility output for (or sizes larger than 8x10), I will go to the local camera shop for pro treatment (after doing a test print on this printer).  If I need a large number of prints made, will likely head to Walgreens or use an online service to save cost.  For everything else, this printer does a fine job for me.<br /><br />3.  Wireless capabilities - I do most of my office and photo work on a laptop, and generally prefer to work in a room in the house far from where the printer sits.  I found wireless extremely easy to set up.  I am running Windows Vista.<br /><br />I did some comparison shopping, and picked this printer over the Epson near-equivalent due primarily to the excellent on-line reviews and the execellent low price of this Canon (when factoring in the significant rebate offered).  Can't say I wouldn't have been equally happy with the Epson, but I can very highly recommend this printer if your needs are similar to mine.<br /><br />One general note (and I suspect that this may be true for any brand/model of printer you buy if you are new to printing digital photographs):  I am still working on understanding color correction (what you see on the screen = what you get from the printer).  I am using photoshop elements 7, and by lots of reading and tweaking settings in multiple application windows am getting to the point were I am able somewhat repeatedly to get acceptably close to my amateur eye.  Expect to spend some time with this.;;5.0;;March 6, 2010;;14;;14;;1.0

This machine uses inks incredibly a lot, and this means that you have to alternate this expensive ink cartridge quite often, and you need to spend a lot of money for maintaining this machine. This must be a big loss in the long run. I am writing this critical review, because this machine is too overrated now in Amazon, warning students or heavy users of printing not to take this one. You may think that this machine is a good deal in terms of price right now, but once you take a long-term perspective, this printer must cost you a lot. So this machine is not so attractive as you may expect or the ad seduces you. Please keep this in your mind, if you are considering buying it: This must be rather an expensive choice.;;2.0;;July 14, 2012;;15;;18;;0.833333

I would never have bought one at $450, but the current rebate deal when you buy a Canon SLR, combined with the fact that I was buying one of those anyway means I now have a professional quality printer and certainly don't regret it.  I have printed everything from flyers to photographs and everything has come out extremely well.  (One exception is the "fast/speed" print mode, which is really for draft use only.) If you can get this printer for the sort of money I paid - do not hesitate.  The only print that didn't wow me was one on Canon Photo Paper glossy, where I forgot to let Photoshop handle the color.

Having had it with built in obsolesence in the HP line, dating toner so you can't stock up and use it later, expiration of printer services, I decided to give this Brother a try.<br /><br />The ease of setup was great - plug and play.  Strange that it had no connection cord, but I've got plenty and hopefully I saved a few bucks by them not making it a part of the package.  It's just something you should know if you live out in the mountains in Idaho, will need the printer immediately upon installation, and don't have any spares laying around.<br /><br />The speed is phenomenal, the print quality more than adequate, and it just does everything it says.  Having previously needing to include HP ink cartridges as a budget item, the longevity of this toner cartridge is like owning a Prius in a gas shortage.  Sometimes you just want to print stuff, just because you can.  Now my copies can simply be calculated at the cost of the paper alone.<br /><br />The only downside to this printer that I can find is the huge power draw as it comes alive.  You better not have much else going on a 15-amp breaker because it sucks the light level down in the room.  I also keep mine plugged into a surge/battery system and that screams Low Batt every time I start a print job.  This doesn't continue, but only lasts for a few seconds while waking up and while the print job is starting.;;4.0;;March 7, 2011;;6;;6;;1.0

A pitch-perfect (but awfully loud) scanner that fires up instantaneously and generates high-res digital facsimiles accurately.  A reliable copy function.  A control panel that is fully intuitive and a wide array of data input options from Flash media to SD data cards.  A roughly competitive negative duplication function.  Fair-to-reasonable ink consumption for a photo printer (although, with  reduced picoliter size, ink usage is more economical than in earlier MP models.) Output on Canon paper is splendid and print speed uneven but generally faster than earlier models.<br /><br />Where the printer falls short is in its wireless networking capabilities. Because of its modest frequency sensitivity and awkward WiFi set-up, the unit could easily consume up to three hours of total set-up time and in certain environments -- more. Running a MacBook Pro with Intel Duo Processors on OSX 10.5.8, I found the network set-up cumbersome and the inconsistent reception of data -- in such a small home -- frustrating (#306 communication errors occur intermittently). Some users will find they need to install a second router, a wireless repeater or gain antenna to avoid daily communication errors when the distance between their router and printer exceeds 35 or 40 feet or runs between floors.<br /><br />The bundled photo software is adequate. The Network and Printer Set-up Utilities are spare but intuitive.<br /><br />Set-up and wireless performance aside, this printer rates an easy "5," but because of its set-up and wireless networking lapses, I must rate this one "4" for the sake of fellow-customers.<br /><br />I've been a faithful Canon customer for 25 years and currently have five Canon printers and two Canon cameras on-site. This AIO is the best of the bunch; however, less complicated set-up and more sensitive wireless frequency response are a must for future printers in the Canon MP line.

You just wanted a low maintenance, fast, reliable, black and white printer with no scanner or fax tacked on...<br /><br />I spent a while looking at printers and settled on this one. I have to say, it helped that this printer was also an attractive professional hardware design. Some of the others (Canon Pixmas, I'm looking at you) looked like ass, frankly. It's also not nearly as large or heavy as the color lasers, for example.<br /><br />Superfast great-looking printouts, classic and proven laser technology, reasonable cost, full OS X support (which I needed in my case), network capable (but not wireless, alas), duplex printing without additional accessory purchases, turns itself on and off as needed to be green... This is it, your search is done.<br /><br />If you do need a scanner to pair with it, I recommend the Fujitsu ScanSnap S1500, by the way. It scans and OCR's as quickly as this prints...<br /><br />EDIT: Others are noting an approximate 5-8 cent per page cost in materials due to the expense of a new toner cartridge (50 to 80+ dollars). Factor that into the equation. The starter toner cartridge is free and some are claiming it will do 400 pages and a full cartridge will do ~1000 pages. I still think that the fact that you hit Print and BAM you have a crisp page... both sides... is amazing enough to justify it.;;5.0;;September 13, 2010;;8;;9;;0.888889

The are two things that you have to be aware of and make sure you are OK with.  One, this is a big printer, it has a large foot print and you need to make sure you have the space for it. Two, the printer has a long start cycle. It takes about a minute for the printer to start up when you turn it on in the morning and it cycles through its start routine. This cycle is also a bit loud.

But, now that Epson has elected to go with a bottom paper tray... card stocks and heavier papers either get JAMMED in the printer... or refuse to take heavier papers AT ALL.  For those of us who print stationery/notecards/greeting cards, etc... the Epson Artisan 837 is NOT THE ANSWER!  NOT at all.  If you're looking for a printer that will take various thicknesses of card stock and heavier papers... the Epson Artisan 837 is NOT FOR YOU!<br /><br />Epson: Please bring back your top-loading paper trays...

A few days after receiving the printer it failed.  Although disappointed, I understand that it is electronics and sometimes this happens.  We called the manufacturer.  After spending over two hours on the phone with their technical support department they said that we would be getting a call back the next day in order to process an order for a replacement.<br /><br />The call never came...now it's Saturday so we had to wait until Monday we called...and gave them the claim number, etc.  However, the tech support representative claimed he had little notes from the last technician and took us through the same two hour process.  Then finally at the end he said he needed $50.00 in order to ship out a new printer.  Frustrated...we went ahead and forked over our credit card.  He claimed that in 3 business days we would have our new replacement printer.  5 days came and went...we called them and they told us it would be another week.  They gave us a tracking number...which UPS says is not valid.  I have a feeling we are out a printer...and $50.00.<br /><br />The printer sure was nice when it functioned...it shipped quickly and I have nothing negative to say...up until it broke a week after we received it.

I researched monochrome laser printers for a couple of weeks before buying this one and I really like this one, it is my first laser printer and much cheaper per page than any inkjet. I actually based my decision on the cost of the toner cartridges. HP's toner cartridges are expensive, but the 85A has been out for a while and there are some really inexpensive and good quality generic cartridges 2 Pack: Compatible HP CE285A Laser Toner Cartridges. I purchased a pack of 2 for about $25 and when I installed it the printer recognized it as genuine hp. The printer is a bit loud but I can live with that. It prints bout three to three and a half reams of paper with the starter cartridge. In my opinion you can't go wrong with this printer. It  has a document feeder which can scan to pdf, one of the functions that I use a lot and the wireless printing is seamless I haven't had to reset the printer or my computer because of a freeze-up. I have it connected to three computers and an iPad and they all work great with it.

Because of our experience with the Canon "falling off" of the network after each print job, my expectation wasn't high for wireless networked printers.<br /><br />This printer changed my mind.  It was extremely easy to set up, easily set up for each of our laptops and iPads and has never been lost on the network.  The fact that I can print from the web while at work was a bonus.<br /><br />Now that we don't have a dedicated computer room and use the laptops all over the house, the sleek design of this printer allows us to place it in the kitchen without making the kitchen look like a home office.  Some have mentioned the door open - tongue out - door close paper management and this may be annoying if I was using it as a desktop printer at my side, but it only takes a few seconds and my print job is waiting for me by the time that I walk to the printer.  Whether annoying for some or not, it does hold the paper on the printer rather than throwing it on the floor as our Canon did.<br /><br />The print quality is good for the documents that I print.  While I'll print an occasional image as part of a document, I don't use it as a photo printer so can't comment on that quality.;;5.0;;September 11, 2011;;6;;7;;0.857143

I just received my Epson R2880 and I cannot say enough good<br />things about it.<br /><br />The set up was a breeze!  I followed the directions in the quick start<br />guide, installed the drivers from the CD enclosed with the printer and went<br />to Epson's site to get the latest ICC profiles.<br /><br />Within thirty minutes I had my first print in hand.  WOW!  Simply<br />outstanding!  Epson?s claim that the R2880 provides "Exhibition Quality<br />Prints" is spot on in my book.<br /><br />The funny thing is, I have a brand new color printer, and the first print I<br />made was black and white.  It brought me back to being a kid in the<br />darkroom, when I made my first black and white print.  (The ones that have<br />had the experience of seeing a print come to life in developer for the first<br />time, know what I?m talking about).  Well, it was just like that experience<br />with my new Epson R2880.<br /><br />The bad thing about that, is now I want to run out and buy a scanner for all<br />those black and white negatives that I have tucked away in the archive. Most<br />likely an Epson V750.<br /><br />The other thing I like about this printer is the ability to use the roll<br />paper attachment that came in the box with the printer.  I installed it just<br />after pulling the printer out of the box.  Now, I can print either a 13" x<br />44" or 8.5" x 44" for either panoramic or gang printing.  In addition, you<br />have the option to print 13" x 19" on 1.3mm thick media and Canvas.  I<br />cannot wait to play with that.<br /><br />What about color prints?  Thanks for asking.<br /><br />The palette of colors seems to be real broad.  The skin tones seem to be<br />spot on and the bright colorful images simply popped!  Hey, after all you<br />have 8 cartridges of Epson?s UltraChrome K3 ink going to that media.<br /><br />That brings me to the ink issue you might have read about in other reviews.<br />All I can say is you get what you pay for!  The Epson R2880 is worth it for<br />the results you will have for a lifetime.<br /><br />The foot print is not small, but you sure do get a lot packed in to its<br />24.3" (W) x 31.4" (D) x 16.3" (H) size.<br /><br />I am hooked on this Epson R2880 printer.  So much so, I signed up for an<br />upcoming Epson Print Academy to get that much more out of my Epson R2880.<br /><br />Just go get one and you will see what I mean.<br /><br />Enjoy the prints of a lifetime!;;5.0;;December 12, 2008;;9;;10;;0.9

Yet I was experiencing long "first page out" times (about 90 seconds), even for copying or printing blank pages.<br /><br />Brother Customer Service was patient as I tried everything  they suggested (plug the Ethernet cable into the router not the switch, power-cycle the router, etc.). But nothing they suggested helped. One rep even insisted that 90-second delays were normal "so the machine has time to cool down before it warms up again". But the specs say the first page should come out in 15-25 seconds unless the printer starts in Sleep Mode, and even that adds just a few seconds.<br /><br />I eventually fixed the problem by deleting the printer from one of my Macs and adding it back a different way. Doing this made Printing roughly as fast as promised not only on that Mac, but also on another Mac and on a Windows 7 PC. Inexplicably, it also made Copying as fast as promised on the MFC.<br /><br />I had originally added my printer to the Mac manually and specified the IPP protocol and the CUPS driver. This time, I added it semi-automatically using Bonjour, and I specified LPD (not IPP) and the BR-Script3 Driver (not CUPS). I first installed the latest BR-Script3 driver.<br /><br />I think the main thing that made it faster was either using LPD instead of IPP or using Bonjour instead of manually naming the print queue. I don't think BR-Script3 yields faster results than CUPS. In fact, the other Mac uses CUPS and starts printing even faster. The Windows machine uses the LPR protocol (another name for LPD) and a PCL driver and is also fast.<br /><br />I recommend not giving up too quickly if this great MFC is slow at first. Be sure you have all the latest software. Add the printer using different protocols and drivers. Power-cycle your router and printer sometimes during your experiments.<br /><br />And most important, be aware that slow printing from one computer (or even slow copying on the MFC without computer involvement) might be caused by software/setup issues on a completely different computer.<br /><br />P.S.: Be aware that graphics on the page will lengthen processing time as will other factors.;;4.0;;January 19, 2012;;8;;8;;1.0

Usually there's some quality about one that makes you say, "It would have been perfect, but if only it didn't have this one problem."  Each aspect of this printer is as good or better than pretty much all other printers out there at this time. And I'm a person who is relentless when it comes to researching products before buying them for myself.<br /><br />Resolution: It goes up to 1200x1200, which is the highest out there currently. 1200x1200 is best for text. But it also does 2400x600, which is typically better for graphics. Most other laser printers only do up to 2400x600.<br /><br />Toner: Cheap! You can pick up "compatible" cartridges for $30 now which will last 8000 pages. This is the cheapest of any printer I've seen. Other printers (such as HP) cost $70 for 2000-3000 pages even with a "compatible" cartridge.<br /><br />Print quality: Excellent. I used a magnifying glass to try to detect any imperfections in text or graphics but didn't find much. No white raster lines, "jaggies", smudging, bleeding, noise or random dots printed anywhere. Large black rectangles are solid and consistent. Gray scale patterns didn't appear to have any defects.<br /><br />Memory: 32MB. Most other laser printers only do up to 8MB currently. You need memory if you want to do full-page graphics. It lets you expand memory by adding an inexpensive ($30 new) 512MB memory card. Many printers don't even allow expansion, or they force you to buy their own special memory cards at a huge price.<br /><br />Paper: Doesn't jam. Easy to load. Has a manual feeder also. Allows 2 extra paper feeders if you want. Most printers don't allow that.<br /><br />Duplex mode: Fast, easy to use, saves paper. I'll never buy another printer without it.<br /><br />Paper curl: You wouldn't notice it unless you were specifically looking for it. Barely detectable even with duplex mode printing and cheap paper. Even envelopes print with hardly any curl.<br /><br />Rear output tray: Has it! Many printers don't. Its predecessor model didn't. This "straight out the back" mode allows you to print envelopes, cards, and special paper without ever bending it if you really want perfection.<br /><br />On/Off switch: Has one! I mention this because many printers don't. Without one, a printer is left on all the time, which uses 10 watts of power (not much, but still) and reduces product lifetime somewhat.<br /><br />Lifetime: The predecessor model (HL-5250DN) has great reviews. People said they're still using it 3 years later. The HL-5370DW has just about the same design, and I expect it will last a while. Not a cheap, throw-away printer like you often see.<br /><br />Networking: Haven't tried it. But it has it, and it will become very useful when I get a wireless laptop to add to my existing desktop PC (both will need to share it).<br /><br />Languages: It speaks both Postscript 3 and PCL. That guarantees it will be compatible with any OS out there, even older ones. And since it doesn't use "host based" language like cheaper printers do, it won't eat up your CPU and slow things down during printing.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a well-designed, high quality printer with low long-term operating costs, and I'm completely satisfied. I'll add an update to this review if I ever encounter problems with it.<br /><br /> - Steve;;5.0;;July 24, 2009;;260;;261;;0.996169

Within a week of setting it up, it stopped working properly. After a grueling 1.5 hours on "chat support" they concluded it had a bad print head and replaced it. So, ok. the support was not easy but it worked. Hence 4 stars.<br /><br />However, the INK issues make me wish I never bought it. HP should be ashamed.<br /><br />First, the ink cartridges are all labeled 564 (or 564XL. Blank, Photo Black, Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow.  Except there's ANOTHER ink cartridge 564/564XL that DOES NOT WORK with this printer. That low-IQ marketing guy they fired from your company for incompetence? He got hired at HP. Luckily if you buy the printer from Amazon, when you go buy ink it tells you "This ink cartridge works (or does not work) with your printer!". Still. Buying ink is a pain in the but as you try to figure out if it's the right one.<br /><br />Next, the ink cartridges claim to print 250 pages (564XL) and 800 pages (564XL).  I'm lucky to get 1/2 that much.<br /><br />To kick you while you're down, the ink cartridges have an electronic ship whose purpose is to prevent you from using other people's ink. But not content with demanding you get "genuine" HP cartridges, they add some kind of counter to it. It actually records how many times you've printed on it and TRIES to estimate how much ink is left in the cartridge. All kinds of built in features in the software to tell you you're running low on ink. Except it's "you're PROBABLY running low on ink. Maybe not." You actually cannot TELL if you're low on ink. You have to keep printing until it runs out. And it seems to track all colors the same. So if you only print red, it still reports your blue is running low. Mine is reporting all the 3 colors are near empty at te same level, as well as the "photo black", except I've never printed any photos after printing the initial "test your printer" photo.  So how could that be as empty as the others?  So I'm left with looking at my printouts to see if I can guess "that green looks a bit bluish, maybe I'm running low on yellow".  What a joke. It would have been much better if they never included such a feature.<br /><br />I'm not even going to address how the 564 and 564XL cartridges are exactly the same size.  Yep.. How does HP fit double the ink into a cartridge the same size? By filling up the 564 only halfway. I could not believe it, so when my ink ran out I actually broke the cartridge appart to lok into it.  Yep. They added a plastic bar to the cartridge about halfway.<br /><br />I've owned 6 different HP printers for my house over the past 30 years (all of the InkJets), from the smallish to the HP 9800 that can print 11x17 paper. I've never been so frustrated and offended. On second thought, I should have given it a 1 star.<br /><br />Dave;;2.0;;June 18, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

A great printer with flexible feed options.<br />This was replaced with Pixma IP4920. What a disappointment! Issues are:<br />1. smaller ink tanks than the IP4300<br />2. Ink tanks are black so the user has no idea of how much ink is left when the printer reports that the cartridge is empty. The IP4300 tanks are transparent and allows for the full usage of the remaining ink.<br />3. Photo print paper cannot be loaded in the cassette and must use to rear feed. My IP4300 allowed photo paper to be loaded in the cassette and was used for both storage and feed of the 4X6 Photo Paper Plus II paper.<br />I will give some serious thought to any printer purchases from Canon in the future.;;2.0;;January 15, 2012;;12;;15;;0.8

I've printed a whole ream of 28lb paper with various text, graphics, etc, along with 20 or so color photos on laserjet photo paper and continue to be impressed with the output. I have made all sorts of copies and sent/received probably 10 faxes (through MagicJack, no less!), as well. All with only one issue....<br /><br />That dang annoying paper curl. This thing just loves to curl the paper, no matter what type of paper, no matter what type of printing. There is even a setting in the setup menu on the unit, called "Reduce Paper Curl", which supposedly reduces the fuser heat, but it makes no difference.<br /><br />The GOOD news is, it's replaceable under warranty! I spent a bit on the phone with HP Business Support (VERY IMPORTANT! You MUST call Business Support@800-334-5144! HP "Total Care" knows nothing about this printer and will just keep transferring you back into their same queue over and over); and was informed that there were an early batch of these units sent out with fusers that were out of spec. The way to tell which fuser you have is to open the back access panel and look at the foam rollers. Supposedly the "new" fusers have orange rollers, and the bad ones(like mine) have black foam rollers.<br /><br />Another good piece of news is, these come with a standard next day, on-site warranty. I have a tech coming out tomorrow to replace said bad fuser assembly. The Business Support agent I spoke with, while clearly not American, was MUCH more knowledgeable and willing to help than the standard Total Care agents. I could also understand him better. In the end, an extremely frustrating experience with the non-business support group, ended up morphing into a somewhat pleasant resolution.<br /><br />I will update the review notes with the outcome tomorrow once I have the unit replaced. I know I won't be able to change the star rating, but even with the curl issue, it's still a solid 3.5-4 stars. Especially considering there are later models released without the curl issue.<br /><br />***UPDATE #1***<br />They are over-nighting the fuser assembly to me and the tech will be here between 10 and 4 to install it. The on-site tech just called and said that if I was so inclined, I could try the swap myself, or if it's more than I care to delve into, then he'd be happy to come do the swap. I'll check and see once it gets here tomorrow.<br /><br />***FINAL UPDATE***<br />Unfortunately, the new fuser did not completely rectify the paper curl problem. It did appear to lessen the curl a bit, however. But, I guess Ill live with it. I will note, the on-site HP tech was wonderful! He was friendly, knowledgeable and very professional and was very apologetic that the fuser swap did not fix the problem. We even spent a bit, looking into the paper path, to see if the rollers were causing the curl issue and not so much the fuser. It wasnt, by the way. If it were the paper path, the curl would be in the opposite direction. He gave me his cell and said to give him a call if there's anything he can do to help out in the future. Short of the agonizing experience I spent initally with the Total Care helpdesk, this has been a very good experience.<br /><br />***The FINAL, FINAL UPDATE***<br />ON a whim, I decided to go back into the menu and re-enable "Less Paper Curl" and that with the combination of the fuser replacement, has netted usable results. The page is still curled, but it's definitely not as bad as it was, pre-fuser change.;;4.0;;September 1, 2009;;50;;50;;1.0

Everything I expected from HP... and more.  I doubt there's a better printer on the market in this price range (I paid just under $100).<br /><br />Setup would have been easy but I had a problem with my wireless router settings that took a while to figure out.  For some reason, the channel on my router was set to 6.  The printer detected my network but wouldn't connect.  Once I changed the channel to 1 it connected immediately.  I couldn't find any information about this in the manual or online support.<br /><br />Once you're set up the printer is assigned an HP email address.  Anything emailed to that address is stored on HP's server.  The printer periodically checks the inbox since it's connected to your network and can access the internet.  If there's anything in your HP inbox it downloads the file and prints the documents.  So you could foward an email from work to your HP address and the documents will be already printed when you get home.  I don't have much use for this feature at the moment but it may come in handy in the future.<br /><br />Each color has it's own separate ink cartridge.  You don't have to replace them all just because you're out of one color.  This saves a lot of money.<br /><br />The apps are great.  These allow your printer to connect to the HP website and print news reports, recipes, coupons, etc. without the need for a PC.  I hope HP develop more of these in the future.<br /><br />I also like that it has two trays, one for regular paper and one for photo paper.  That's saves a lot of time and wasted paper.<br /><br />You can download a free app from iTunes to scan/print from your iPod/iPhone.<br /><br />Overall, I have very little to complain about.  I'd prefer it to be less shiny so it doesn't show finger marks so easily.  I guess that's the current fashion in electronics these days.  Everything used biege, then silver, then shiny white and now shiny black.  Maybe the fashion will cycle back to biege again one day ;-)<br /><br />The next model in the range is basically the same except it includes automatic duplexing (print both sides).  It would've been nice to have but I couldn't justify the extra cost for the few times I'd actually use it.<br /><br />Some people have reported problems with the printer going into sleep mode and not waking up when a document is sent.  I have not experienced this problem.  The printer automatically downloaded and installed a firmware upgrade when I installed it so may that fixed the problem.;;5.0;;February 26, 2011;;6;;6;;1.0

It is probably very similar to the 7840, but I've only seen the 7840 and never had it at my home office. This new model is compact -- much shorter than my old HP 3330 that lasted me 10 years. Bullet points:<br /><br />1. It prints very quickly, putting out my 20-page appraisal reports in less than a minute.<br />2. It scans FAST, taking about 10 seconds to scan a child's book cover in COLOR. The scan looked decent. I haven't had time to check it at different quality settings.<br />3. It uses a smaller toner cartridge (the TN-420) than my old printer and costs $45 at Office Depot, but I know I can get the recycled "higher capacity" cartridge (TN-450) for about $30 bucks (including shipping) on eBay. There is also a separate drum unit that the toner cartridge fits into. I was told by the Office Depot guy that it's about $125 but only needs to be replaced at 8,000 or 10,000 copies (I think -- I could be well off on that statement).<br />4. The only "negative" with the machine (and it's not a huge deal) is the printer noise. It is idle and quiet all the time prior to prints, scans or copies and even has a "sleep" and "deep sleep" modes -- great energy saving features that my old machine didn't have. However, following any sort of printing, the machine's motor will run for 5-10 minutes straight. My old machine didn't do that. I got used to it quickly, as I really don't print papers all day long and it eventually settles into sleep mode and is quiet much of the day.<br />5. A good looking printer, especially if you have other components with black (i.e. monitor border, speakers, computer tower, etc.) on them. This black is not shiny, too, which means its a little more dust and scratch resistant.<br />6. It works wirelessly with laptops/netbooks. A great selling feature. It took about 5 minutes for my HP netbook to automatically download the drivers (i.e. "adding the printer" wirelessly) and the first printout worked great.<br />7. I paid $299 at Office Depot, which has a 14-day return policy if I suddenly become disenchanted with the machine. I know I paid a little more than Amazon but I like to be able to return stuff in person if need be. If you go to Office Depot, don't get suckered into 2-year warranty plans ($40), gold plated cables (although it needs USB cable or ethernet as serial ports are a thing of the past). And don't buy toner right off the bat. It comes with a low-capacity starter cartridge. Start with that and see if you like the printer.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased after a week with this product. So far, so good.;;5.0;;May 2, 2011;;11;;12;;0.916667

Since I don't print pictures, a black and white printer is sufficient. I couldn't be happier with the HP 1020. It's very compact (actually smaller than my Epson), unbelievably fast (though it takes a little while to get going), and the result is crystal clear. One important note, though: I'm a Mac user and this printer isn't intended to support  Macs. But I learned from other reviewers on this site that you can solve this problem by downloading the printer driver from HP for the HP Laserjet 1022, which does support Macs. I did this, but the other reviewers left out an important bit of information: the directions that come with the printer say to wait until instructed to plug in the computer and attach it to your computer via a USB cable. But this is NOT what you do in the case of using the 1022 driver for this machine. Instead, after downloading the driver from ther HP website (which you can do for free, afte going to their support page), connect the 1020 to the power source and to your computer; then go to Printer Utility, select Add Printer, and the Mac will do the rest (it automatically uses the 1022 driver to support the 1020). Once my partner did this (I was in a muddle until she did so!), it all went very smoothly. For the very low price that Amazon is asking, now even Mac users can enjoy this outstanding printer.;;5.0;;November 18, 2005;;16;;16;;1.0

I had bought another Canon printer a year ago which broke, but Best Buy honored the warranty and I got this one. Turns out - they made this one so it takes *smaller* ink cartridges than the last one, and those last one's were pretty tiny.<br /><br />After moderate use, I recently had to order new ink cartridges myself. Well - the standard pack doesn't come with "GRY", so I had to order that separate, as well as the big black one. For *just* the color ones - it cost $64.08 (sixty four dollars and eight cents) in INK off Amazon.<br /><br />It's really expensive.

Unlike the other reviewers here, I had absolutely no problem setting this printer up. My router doesn't have the WPS function, but it was still easy to setup using a USB cord. All I had to was download the driver from the Brother website and followed the instructions. I then installed the driver on my husband's laptop and it was just as easy. I think that if you just follow the on-screen directions, you'll have no problems at all.<br /><br />The wireless is very nice, it doesn't have to stay connected to your router or anything. After you setup, you won't need to connect your computer to the printer either.<br /><br />The duplex function is absolutely great! I used to have to sit next to my printer and click ok, flip (sometimes I'd flip it the wrong way), click ok...it was very tedious. This printer is quick and isn't loud at all (to me at least, and I had the Brother 2070N before this).<br /><br />Toner is relatively cheap compared to other laser printers and they are much more efficient than inkjets. If you print a lot, this is the printer for you. You'll save money on paper with the auto duplexing and even more with the affordable toners.<br /><br />The only "complaint" I have about this printer is that sometimes my husband will send a print job while he's upstairs and it scares me when it starts printing so suddenly!;;5.0;;February 14, 2011;;7;;7;;1.0

So, with that context, onto my experiences with the wide format printer.<br /><br />The first one of these I bought started having problems after a few months, mostly with dragging black ink, and also with stray ink drops.  Cleaning the print heads would help for awhile, then it would start again.  After a little over a year, I couldn't get any clean prints so I replaced it.

The printer is satisfactory, but no better or worse than others. The problem is that it uses ink at an amazing rate and it's expensive. There are 6 ink cartridges, and one is always low or out at any one time.<br /><br />To make it worse, when you run out of say, yellow ink, the printer does not work at all even if you just want to use black ink to print a paper, its inoperable. When one ink is out, the printer is down and out of business until it's replaced. Remember, there are 6 cartridges, one will be low or out, the majority of the time because it uses ink quickly.<br /><br />On top of it, Epson has cleverly put in a pop up box when your printer no longer works and is out of a color, to buy their cartridges on line. This box will not leave your desktop screen until the cartridge is replaced.<br /><br />The printer is ok, but it's the most expensive printer I've ever used in terms of ink, and the fact it doesn't work when one is out is inexcusable. The fact that you have to live with a pop up in your face until you replace the expensive cartridge, is salt in the wound.

The exact time is dependent on time zone, obviously. I include this here for anyone trying to setup their new printer and not realizing why the Epson Connect (remote printing) isn't working. I will remove this notice after the outage has transpired.<br /><br />This printer is a very basic, no frills printer, easy to setup, cheap to maintain.  It's cost is comparable to similar models, the big plus are the very inexpensive individual ink refills- low cost for continued use.<br /><br />This printer is ideal for someone who needs a basic inkjet color printer, low-cost ink, does not need a photo printer nor faxing capability and scans single pages at a time (such as scanning photos).<br />For what the printer is and what it is marketed as, it is a 5-star printer and I have rated it as such.<br /><br />This printer does NOT have a document feed tray - scans are a single page at a time.<br />This printer is NOT an all-in-one as it does NOT include a fax.<br />This printer is NOT a photo-quality printer.<br />This printer does NOT come with a USB cable - as it is not needed on most wireless networks.<br /><br />If you need the above capabilities (document feed tray, faxing, etc) consider the Epson Workforce line of printers- they are also easy to setup, very reliable, and use reasonably priced consumables (ink).;;5.0;;August 22, 2012;;53;;53;;1.0

The "W" in the model name denotes that it is wireless, but as a WIRELESS printer, this thing is useless.  Let me clarify, this is a fabulous printer.  The print quality and speed are great. I am impressed with how quickly the printer comes ready, and also how quiet it is for a laser printer.  The downside is that the wireless feature is horribly flawed.  By default, the printer sleeps after a minute, and when the printer sleeps, so does the wireless connection.  Logically, when the wireless sleeps, the printer cannot be woken up by the wireless network.  The sleep time can be turned up to two hours, but that means higher power use, and it still means that after two hours the only way to use the printer again is to manually cycle the power.<br />I went through a few rounds with Samsung web chat support and e-mail support, and they walked me through setting a static IP (which I had already done) and told me to turn the sleep time up to two hours, which doesn't do anything to help me, it just means that if I'm that clueless, it will be a minimum of two hours until I try to contact their tech support again to complain that after two hours I can't connect to the printer.<br />The upside, and the reason I might just end up keeping the printer, is that there is an Ethernet jack in addition to the wireless, and the wired Ethernet connection does wake the printer from sleep.  I just had to figure that out on my own.<br />The bottom line is: great printer, good network printer, awful wireless, even worse customer support;;1.0;;August 28, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

I chose this one based on reviews and really wanted to get a laser printer.  No thermal paper, film rolls, or inkjet cartridges this time<br /><br />I bought the 2820 along with the IO Gear GPSU21 USB network print server.  So far, I like it.<br /><br />Footprint:<br /><br />Surprisingly, it has a smaller footprint than the HP Inkjet it replaced.  A little taller but the printouts come out at the top so you can put a book or a coffee cup in front of the printer without blocking the pages coming out.<br /><br />Noise Level:<br /><br />I thought it was a little noisy at first but that's only when it's printing.  After a few minutes, the fan turns off and it goes silent.<br /><br />Compatibility with other electronics:<br /><br />If you have an answering machine, you can set up an option that will let the answering machine pick up but still listen for CG (fax) tones.  BTW, if you use VoIP service instead of a standard telephone line, then an analog fax machine may not work well ([...]).<br /><br />Printing and Copying:<br /><br />Printing is fast compared with ink jets.  I tried the copying function and it fed multiple sheets smoothly.  Print quality is up there with what you'd see in an old fashioned newspaper.  Text is great and photos are adequate (but black and white of course).  Capacity is 1500 pages with the "starter" toner that comes with the machine and 2500 pages with the TN350 replacement cartridge.<br /><br />I've also learned that when the "replace toner" alarm comes on you can tape over some holes on the side of the cartridge and buy yourself enough time to order a replacement toner.  I see refurbished ones going for about what you'd pay for a recycled black ink cartridge.<br /><br />There are laser printers with much higher capacity for more money.  These usually have a larger footprint, may be noisier, etc.  Depending on how much printing you do, the higher capacity lasers could be a better deal.  For my use this model is more than enough.<br /><br />Faxing:<br /><br />The fax modem runs at up to 14.4kbps which is about 50% faster than most low budget fax machines.  You can get "high speed fax machines" for more money but sending a fax at 33.8kbps to or from a normal residence line is an iffy proposition.  The best I ever did with an analog modem was 24kbps, even when dialing into UUNet (Worldcom) which seemed to have a POP in every telephone exchange.<br /><br />Like HP, Brother has a toll free test line that you can fax your warranty registration to and receive a test fax back.<br /><br />Software and Network Printing:<br /><br />The software suite you can download from Brother's web site has a PC to fax function so you could send faxes directly from a PC to the fax machine and then out the telephone line without having to print them first.  I haven't tried it but it looks like a time saver.<br /><br />Setting the printer up over a network with the IO Gear print server worked quite well.  Brother sells it's own print server but it costs about the same as the fax machine.  The ones from Brother I've seen on Amazon are outrageously expensive.<br /><br />Delivery:<br /><br />As usual, Amazon's partner delivered quickly.  No issues there.<br /><br />The bottom line:<br /><br />All in all, more than adequate for our needs.;;4.0;;January 16, 2010;;9;;9;;1.0

I did not buy it for a primary printer as much as I did for it's all in one capability and a printer capable of printing small paper sizes for check endorsements and deposit slips.<br /><br />I am not at all impressed with the capacity of the cartridges. First of all, the machine ships with "Starter Cartridges" that only have about 1/2 or 1/3 the capacity of a standard cartridge. Standard color is 1500 pages and B&W is 2300 pages. Starter Cartridges are claimed to have 800 page capacity for color and B&W. Secondly, the starter cartridges do not even have the stated capacity of 800 pages at 5% coverage as they claim (see footnote). After just 240 B&W page prints (as indicated by the counter) The toner low warning is on. In this case I can determine most of what I have printed by just counting the number of checks endorsed and deposit slips printed. The print jobs have 81 & 67 characters respectively. Of the 240 print jobs 182 were checks or deposit slips so the remaining 58 were faxes or the occasional copy job. Assuming that the remaining 58 documents fell into the normal 5 % range, that is only a total of about 72 documents at a 5% coverage rate. Even if the color page print count of 178 is included, (maybe some black is used to print color), that is still well below 800 pages. I have sent emails to Canon and they don't think there is anything wrong with this so I can only conclude their toner capacity is over stated by about 80-90%.<br /><br />I have the cn model which lacks the wi-fi feature. The first printer they sent me had either software or hardware problems, it would not work with the network. The second printer worked ok with the network but I was not impressed with the computer interface software. Most functions are not controllable from the computer and it is necessary to set function commands, like paper size and which tray to use, at the printer. As another review mentioned, after printing, it does have an annoying readjust mode that takes up to a minute and a half to complete before another print job can be accepted.  In general I would give the printer on board software and the accompanying computer interface software a generious D-. As a network printer, due to the number of functions that need to be controlled at the printer I would give it a failing grade.<br /><br />The copy and fax and scan functions work well and are consistent with what would be expected for machine suitable for a small office. It would be nice though if the faxes could be routed to a computer to save paper and toner. It would also be nice to have a scan resolution greater than 300 DPI.<br /><br />The only good thing Canon has done right with this printer is to provide excellent access to the paper path. If a paper gets jammed, it is very easy to access any part of the path to facilitate its removal. I have 10 year old HP Laserjet 6P printer that is a great, reliable and inexpensive printer to operate. Unfortunately, once in a great while, in about 1 in ten paper jams, and it almost never jams, it is necessary to dismantle the printer to clear paper from the fuser assembly and takes over an hour.<br /><br />Foot Note:  Canon tech rep stated in an email, 5% coverage is equal to about 14 lines of text. The first 14 lines of this review has 1279 characters. My 181 endorsment and deposit slip documents have a total of 14560 characters. That would equal about 12 documents at 5% using the tech reps coverage statement.;;1.0;;February 7, 2012;;12;;14;;0.857143

I have owned it for almost a month. I bought it for the two sided printing which works flawlessly. Text printing quality is absolutely outstanding, especially if you set it to the highest quality 1200 resolution (called prores). I have done some limited graph and image printing. No complaints there but I focus on text quality.<br /><br />Paper tray use and adjustment is very easy and toner replacement also simple. I haven't done envelopes as I use a label printer so no idea how well envelopes work. Network installation in a home office was simple and straightforward. I us os X  and the driver has a nice booklet printing feature that I find very useful. The printer does business cards on card stock which I have found problematic on other lasers. It also has the option of a straight paper path which is highly useful for some kinds of jobs. It can be set to a quiet mode that slows things down to about half speed, but even that speed is fine for most jobs and can be easily reset for the few big ones I do. One negative is that even in quiet mode it is a little loud, not overwhelming, but that is the only (very slight negative). Another downside is on the windows side (which I run from a virtual machine now and then). The windows drivers have an intrusive autoupdate feature that I have not figured how to disable. Also, it comes with a starter toner cartridge (maybe 1600 pages) which means having to add the cost of a full cartridge pretty soon. The positive here is that there are two replacement toners, a 2500 pager and a huge 6300 pager. Too bad Amazon doesn't sell these directly so I can't use Amazon prime. My final complaint is the lack of a printed manual - you have to rely on the .pdf on the install disk. Unfortunately, this seems standard for all manufacturers. By the way downloading and installing the latest drivers for os X was a piece of cake.<br /><br />I have been very critical of some other HP products in the past, but this one is a winner.;;5.0;;February 18, 2009;;15;;15;;1.0

Before that I had an HP Officejet 6500a Wireless which I considered a piece of trash because none of the drivers or software never worked properly and the machine froze up frequently.  The HP Officejet 6500a was an upgrade from an HP Officejet 6310 which had wonderful print quality and never froze but had no wireless.  This HP Officejet 4620 is comparable to the HP Officejet 6310 in most respects except that it is a bit more noisy (but not to the point of it being unbearable).  This printer was really easy to set up and it has better execution of the Scan and Fax function (which can be set as the default faxing method) than the HP Officejet 6310, and it can be set up to turn on and off on a schedule in addition to its sleep mode.  It doesn't get five stars because it's not perfect because of the noise but for faxing, scanning and occasional non-photo color printing, it seems pretty good so far.

However, now and again there are strange problems that prevent printing and the manual is not helpful on this. For instance, it will apparently not accept label paper from the tray - this must be fed manually, but I can find no reference in the manual, and it took me too much time of frustration to find this on my own. Most recently, I found that it will refuse to print at all once it determines the toner is too low. This is despite the fact that the print quality had not diminished at all. But there was nothing I could do to change this, I had to toss out (recycle) a toner cartridge with probably hundreds of pages left in it and put in a costly replacement. In my experience with HP printers, they will continue to print and milk out every last drop of a cartridge. The user is left to decide what is an acceptable level in need of replacement.<br /><br />Full disclosure - this latter problem compelled me to write the review. It really ticks me off to throw out a serviceable toner cartridge so that I can feed more money to Brother to replace it.;;2.0;;May 8, 2011;;6;;6;;1.0

Which maybe why I ran out of the cyan so fast when I had the 126 cyan in the printer.<br /><br />I also have used this constantly for my Dad to print double-sided for copies of he business papers, tax forms and other forms we need to keep on file. It has only jamed once and that was because I didn't set the printer to the correct setting I had it on paper with only text and it was a paper that had a picture on it...which did warm me to change the setting but I failed to read it until I tried printing that paper again!<br /><br />I am now trying to print my return address on the large greeting cards and have yet to find how to put it to that setting. It only lets me do envelopes at a 5.5 to 8.5 when I need it to be 5.75 x 8.5. I tried printing one at that setting and it does not look good. I will read online to see if I can find a way to do it. Which by the way Epson has these videos that you can watch that let you actually see on your computer which parts to click on for different projects! I lost my direction book and found the one for doing double sided printing and it was easy as can be!<br /><br />Easy installation! You can go on-line and watch how to do that before you actually attempt it if you worry you might screw it up! I did because I hate fixing my dumb mistakes! I was glad I did!<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it has been difficult to see how to print those one envelopes and also my Dell Printer which only prints black ink and the colored ink part broke right after warranty...why I got this one, does copy much better pictures and also is easier to figure out. I don't like how this Epson works for making picture copies and the pictures just don't look right. I will keep my Dell for that picture scanning reason! Keep in mind that I may not have it at a correct setting so don't let that stop you from buying this printer. Look it up on the Epson site first to see if you can change the settings. I don't care for right now!;;4.0;;May 23, 2012;;5;;6;;0.833333

By that, I mean that I have already converted 4 years worth of business paperwork into PDF files. This thing is QUICK at scanning, and at printing. My only gripe is the lack of third party ink. You MUST buy original Canon manufacturer ink, as the cartridges use RF chips to monitor their use and quantity of ink. Refilling is also a pain since the cartridges are not clear or opaque. Canon ink is not cheap, but on the plus side this thing seems to sip ink, instead of gulp like my old Canon i860.<br /><br />Photo quality is excellent. Text printing is great.<br /><br />It does seem a lot larger than I thought it was going to be, but it's a nice, tidy footprint when it sits on my desk all closed up. I really like the paper tray underneath the printer. I've been used to having to load paper for each print. This is a real nice benefit.<br /><br />I use this wirelessly with several Macs.

The setup was very straight forward and switching out the printer ink has been painless. When the ink is low, the light flashes and it is very easy to pop out the old one and put in the new one. I use the Canon paper and have been very happy with the results. I have tried them all and my favorite is the semi-gloss for color prints and the fine art matte for black and whites. The only downside to the Canon Fine Art Papers is that you can not print a 13x19 size print, but with the semi-gloss I get a beautiful 13x19 size print that compares if not exceeds what I am use to getting from a pro lab. I would highly recommend this printer.;;5.0;;June 2, 2010;;8;;8;;1.0

Print quality is excellent, for photos as well as documents.  The pictures I've printed so far look better than those I've gotten from Walgreen's or Snapfish.  Although I probably won't be printing dozens of photos at a time,I can see that the capability will come in very handy for those times when I want to print selected photos, and don't want to bother with going out to Walgreen's or mail ordering them.  For example, if someone admires one of my photos, I can give them a copy of it on the spot.<br /><br />Scan quality is great; it lets you specify the resolution of the saved scan file.  So, you can use a lower quality for things such as letters or maps, and increase the resolution for photos where you want to capture lots of detail.<br /><br />I haven't tried any of the more esoteric functions such as e-fax (and in all likelihood will never need them), so I can't comment on how well they work. For the basic functions of print, scan, and copy, it works great.<br /><br />In another review someone groused about paying $100 for the five ink cartridges.  That is really a bit misleading, since there are separate cartridges for high quality photo black, the three colors (cyan, magenta and yellow), and a large black ink cartridge for regular non-photo printing such as text documents.  If one of the cartridges gets low you can replace just that one cartridge; you do not have to replace all the others like you would with a single "combo"  cartridge (e.g., if one color gets low, you just buy the one cartridge and keep on using the other ones). This is important since you aren't likely to use up all the colors at the exact same pace. And, for only a few bucks more, you can get the XL cartridges that contain a lot more ink, and will last a lot longer between replacements.<br /><br />NOTE:  the lady at Officemax suggested I replace the original black cartridge that came with the printer with the larger XL cartridge from the very start.  DO NOT DO THIS.  The instructions in the downloaded user's manual specifically state that the cartridges that come with the printer are special "setup" cartridges and must be the ones that are used when the printer is first configured.  If another cartridge is used, the printer won't be set up the way it is supposed to.<br /><br />The color touch screen menus are very easy to use; one thing I especially liked was how well the virtual keyboard works.  It requires just enough pressure so that it almost totally eliminates accidentally entering the wrong letter or number.  A very gentle push is required; the letter / number then appears in a magnified highlight for a split second so you also get a positive visual confirmation. It is much better in this respect than the touch screens on my camera or e-book reader.<br /><br />I could go on raving about the features and quality of the printer but other reviews have already covered them.  So, let me now move on to setting the thing up and attaching it to an existing network.  In my case, I was installing it on an existing home wireless network, controlled by a Linksys router.  The main PC is a Dell running Vista 32 bit Premium Home Edition; the laptop is on Windows XP. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to quickly integrate the printer into this network.  The only big problem was that the CD that came with the printer was apparently corrupted; after going through the bulk of the software install process I got an error message telling me to "contact the vendor".  So, I did what I should have done in the first place and downloaded the software package from the HP 7510 support page.<br /><br />I also downloaded the user's manual pdf file at the same time.  I would suggest you do this as well, and read it prior to installing your printer.  There is information pertaining to the printer installation and network setup that is not in the skimpy printed little paper manual that comes packaged with the printer.  And, as discussed in a previous paragraph, there was the very important tip about the importance of using the setup cartridges that came with the printer.<br /><br />Once I had the software downloaded to the main PC, I ran the .exe file and everything worked great.  I turned the printer on and went to the Wireless menu.  The menu screen showed my home network's name; I selected it.  When prompted I input the security code for that network.  A few menu clicks later lo and behold, the printer was connected to the network.  I've powered the PC, router and printer off and on several times over the past few days; in all instances the printer has effortlessly re-connected to the network.<br /><br />Getting the laptop in the other room to recognize the 7510was easy as well. I copied the downloaded software onto a thumb drive and plugged the drive into the laptop.  Ran the file, followed the prompts and the laptop was also connected to the printer.<br /><br />Anyway, my experiences with the printer thus far have been very positive.  Hopefully the above hints will help you as well.;;5.0;;March 7, 2012;;23;;23;;1.0

I have no idea, I guess so they can make you buy more ink all the time. Another thing that sucks about these printers is that they don't have refillable ink cartridges like other printers, making they expensive. I got so pissed today trying to print up a paper (grey scale) but couldn't due to my lack of cyan I went and got a Brother's laser printer for $89.<br /><br />Unless you have deep pockets and a supply of ink close at hand I would recommend another brand of printer.

DO NOT BUY IT!!;;The only good thing I have to say about this printer is that the duplexer works really great.  The CP2025 is noisy and slow, and its cartridges are VERY EXPENSIVE.  Once any ONE color cartridge runs out, it stops the entire printer: you cannot even print monochrome after that. It stinks like burning plastic when doing 100 pages or more. It prints pictures darker than they should be. After every ten pages it stops to "CLEAN."  All paper, even 28 or 32 lb paper comes out all crooked; do not even consider doing manual back to back printing.  Index cards come out bent diagonally, and are impossible to file.  I have worked with HP printers for about 25 years now, and have always held them in high esteem.  This one, despite the glowing reviews I read up front, has greatly disappointed me.  The tray comes out too easily and is flimsy.  You cannot override the settings to ensure the printer uses only one tray.  I loaded as many index cars in tray as it will take, and started a print job.  Once the printer finished printing all those cards, it  immediately started pulling letter paper from tray 2.  I had wasted about 50 pages before I realized what was going on.  I admit, that is my stupidity.  I should have known by that time I dare not trust this printer!  I will gladly give it away (to someone I hotly dislike), but that would load the recipient with a liability rather than an asset, and a costly one to maintain, too. I know no one I so hotly dislike!!! Website support is HyperPathetic. (Capital letters intended). Numerous times I had to go through a maze, only to be informed the CP2025dn is not a valid printer name, and that even though I registered the printer after buying it.  I once sought help on the website but got nowhere.  I emailed the webmaster, and he was very helpful in response.  But not being technical support he could not give me a proper answer.

Despite the fact that the auto connect to my wireless didn't quite work, and the interface to enter a password manually is a bit clunky, this printer was up on the network in a matter of minutes. Score one for the PIXMA.<br /><br />Next step? The dreaded printer install... what's that? My Mac detected the printer on the network automatically, pulled down the most recent drivers, and had it running in 2 more minutes with nary a reboot? It worked just like we all imagined technology would in the year 2012? Amazing. And without any clunky extra printing or scanning software. Good job, Canon + Apple.<br /><br />Finally, on to the printing and scanning. Print quality, good. Duplex, works as advertised. Speed, totally adequate and maybe even a little impressive. Scanning, along with some nice auto-detection features for when you scan multiple items (say, a passport and a driver's license) at the same time, was also quick and painless. Shows up right away as a source in the relevant apps, and you're off to the races.<br /><br />Aesthetically, it's also sleek, small, and doesn't get in the way. All that you'd want out of a printer.<br /><br />If I had one complaint, the print tray where the finished docs come out is really short, so especially in my setup where it's still on a small table with no real surface in front of the printer, the printouts droop down. They don't fall on the ground, just look like they could use a shot of Viagra.<br /><br />Great product so far... let's see how far it makes it before I have to sacrifice my first born child to buy ink refills.;;4.0;;June 27, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

I wanted higher resolution with duplex and so, given my experience with the previous Lexmark, it was natural to upgrade to the E260d.<br /><br />Well, I've had the printer for several days now and can report that it's everything I was expecting - great print quality, fast print times and no paper feed issues.<br /><br />The only slight problem ... seemed to be the dreaded Mac envelope mess reported here.  The first time I tried an envelope ... argh! ... exactly as other users have said, the print was off the side of the envelope.  I have to admit, I read those reviews before buying and figured a company like Lexmark couldn't have failed to solve an issue reported as far back as 2009.  Looking further around now that I had the issue, there seemed to be no solution posted on the internet.  I was worried.  BUT ... I contacted Lexmark support and, within a few minutes they had a solution.  And the solution, seemingly for the first time on the internet is:<br /><br />In the print dialogue, from the menu that initially reads 'Layout', select 'Paper Feed'.  From the menu that appears, change 'Auto Select' to 'Manual Envelope'.  And that's it.<br /><br />Now, Lexmark has had 2 years to fix their paper 'Auto Select' which seems to fail to 'auto' select Envelope when the page size is set to Envelope ... but still - their support was excellent and the printer is a bargain for what you get.  We'll see what the toner costs turn out to be - but I was pleasantly surprised by the toner use of my E232 and I'm hoping this will be the same.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If this fits your needs, you wont regret buying it.;;5.0;;February 9, 2011;;9;;10;;0.9

I bought this primarily for the following reasons:<br />1. It is a wireless printer 2. It can scan; 3. It can do double sided printing; 4. You can directly email a scanned document to someone without having to save it to your computer 5. The ink was cheap.<br />I do not print too much but this month my kids had some homework and I had some work that I brought home and so I must have printed about 50 pages a week for about 3 weeks.<br />I do not use it to fax or for photo printing.  So I had a cheap Canon Pixma 1600 that broke down on me after over 7-8 years of use. Was very happy with it. It was robust like a horse. When it broke I was looking for a basic wireless all in one. At Best Buy there was a Lexmark rep. who sold me on this printer and so instead of a cheap $70 Lexmark all-in-one I ended up buying this printer.<br />Installation: It was a breeze to install and get it up and running. I have it running on Windows XP, Windows 7 and Mac OS 10.6.5 ( I run Win XP on the MAC with Fusion 2.x and now under Fusion 3.x the printer works with both).<br />Experience :<br />Everything was fine the first week. It scanned, the paper feed works, worked wirelessly (woke up from sleep and printed etc etc. I was happy as a lark). After the first week, the print head went bad and I had to physically clean it to print properly again. Customer /Tech support promised to send me a replacement within less than a week. Guess what it did not arrive and when I called they just promised to replace the printer instead as the printhead kit was on back order. (But they did not proactively let me know that, I had to follow up on it). Ok so I get the replacement printer and voila what a pleasant surprise. They shipped me the Lexmark Platinum Pro 905 and informed me to keep that instead and send the Lexmark 901 back to them. Now I was really happy that they did this and the printer arrived on time!!<br />Guess what, within less than a week the printhead went bad. This time it could not even be cleaned !! I chatted again with Tech Support (now Lexmark really has neat tech support. They remotely logged into my computer and ran a scan and took a copy of my printhead and saw how it was damaged). They said it was a known issues that the printheads heat up excessively causing the ink to stick. They said the entire batch/few batches were bad batches and they would ship me a new printhead from a batch where the known quality issues had been fixed !!<br />That was a surprise. Apparently Lexmark has not bothered to do a recall or let the customers know about this issue but have instead let the customers experience this problem and then call them to get the issue fixed.<br />So once again I am out of a printer and this time I cannot even print as the printer gave an error that the printhead was bad and would not let me print (but would scan). Of course Tech Support once again promises to ship me a replacement printhead within 1-2 business days. Of course once again it does not arrive and I have to follow up and they said how about we send you a new printer instead. Boy I said this is Groundhog Day!! I have been through this and no please do not ship me a new printer as this will not solve my problem as I am pretty sure the printhead in the new printer will also be bad. Why not just ship me a new printhead kit where the quality issues have been fixed. So they say ok, but will take 2-3 weeks before this can be done. I am frustrated as hell, but said ok, I will wait (its the holidays and I do not have any urgent printing to do).<br />Now as luck would have it, Lexmark had also shipped me a replacement printhead and luckily it just arrived so I replace the printhead and I am able to print once again. But guess what, this time it would not print RED. It would print all the other colors but not RED. Instead of RED it would substitute Yellow. Boy was I mad. I had replied to a survey that Lexmark had where I mentioned that it would be good if some one were to call me and followup on the issues I was having with my printer.<br />They were very prompt about it and sure called me at the appointed time and walked me through the issue and asked me to replace the RED ink with the ink sent with the new printhead kit (remember I was still awaiting the replacement kit from the most recent printhead on the new printer gone bad and they had simultaneously shipped me a replacement kit for my original Lexmark 901 printer). So luckily I had the spare ink and voila the printer works fine now. So this time I had a bad RED ink.<br />So at this time it is now over 30 days and I cannot return my printer.<br />I do like this printer do not get me wrong. I just want it to work like my Pixma did without any issues. But my life seems consumed by the number of issues.<br />Granted it may be bad luck on my part that I had to have so many issues with Lexmark products all in one shot. I am willing to work with Lexmark and they have been good about support and I do not have complaints other than they do not proactively tell you if a shipment will be delayed or not.<br />I am still awaiting a replacement printhead kit ( and I hope I get it on time or the current printhead does not die on me like the previous ones have).<br />So if any of you are considering buying this printer be aware of the issues the Lexmark printers have with the Printheads because if I had some urgent printing to be done I would have gone berserk. I am patient, but there is a limit.<br />Lexmark should be more open and issue a recall on the printers or printhead and send replacement kits to all who own printers having a printhead from known bad batches of printheads.  I am sure they should be able to track these, after all I have registered my printer with them.<br />If this printer continues to operate without further issues then I will revise my rating.<br />But for this main issue I would have rated this printer with 5 stars, but I simply cannot do that given the circumstances. Maybe its a comedy of errors with my printer and my experience is just unique. I am willing to give Lexmark a chance and hopefully this time the printhead will last over 5 years. What's good about a 5 year warranty if you constantly have issues with the product.<br />P.S. I have not isolated this issue but at times it does not auto print double sided. I have not been able to get the printer to be stable enough to spend time to figure out why this happens or under what circumstances. It is random  and rare for me at the moment.<br /><br />Update Jan 15, 2011:<br />My kids have been heavily using this printer for the last 2 weeks and we have not had any issues at all with this printer since Lexmark replaced my last printhead. So I feel comfortable to overlook the initial issues with the printheads (can happen to any manufacturer) more so given the follow up that Lexmark has done both via phone and email (was truly pleasantly surprised by their genuine concern for customer satisfaction). One does not get that kind of support from other companies. By the way the replacement printhead came as promised and the printer has been very stable. You do need to ensure your firmware and drivers are updated as Lexmark has issued both updates in Dec 2010 and Jan 2011 (which I applied in Jan 2011).<br />I have revised my rating to 4 stars and if this printer holds up will revise to 5 stars in the near future.<br />Based on my most recent experiences and proactive followup by Lexmark, I would not have any hesitation recommending this printer to anyone for their home office needs.;;4.0;;December 17, 2010;;11;;12;;0.916667

To clarify these statements, I would say that the color is not great for professional photographers or those who require precise color printing. Despite this, the color printing quality should not be a problem for everyday prints, such as school/work reports, personal projects, etc.<br /><br />I have noticed 2 drawbacks:<br />1. The printer was bulkier and heavier than I expected. Make sure you check the printer's dimensions/weight to make sure you know what you're getting.<br />2.

RIU9RH1WH0JTW;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3NXGOYB8DYX9O;;Printer;;B002ONCDH4;;Brother HL-3070CW Compact Digital Color Printer with Wireless Networking;;Brother HL-3070CW works well, great value [NEEDED REPAIR];;** THIS MACHINE NEEDED REPAIR 2 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE, SEE UPDATE BELOW **<br /><br />Introduction / History:<br /><br />I already own a Brother MFC-7820N black-and-white multifunction networked laser, which has worked very well for 4 years, with only one change of the toner & drum unit needed in that time. Our occasional color needs were met with an old HP inkjet, or a late night trip to Kinkos, and I print  several hundred color photos a year at Ritz Camera.<br /><br />Now we need color printing more often, so I read the reviews and bought the HL-3070CW, which is a color laser printer only (not multi-function), with 802.11 b/g WiFi connectivity.  THIS PRINTER IS NOT DESIGNED TO PRINT GREAT PHOTOS. You can print pictures for grade school projects on regular paper. For anything higher quality, look elsewhere. For nice looking office documents, this printer is for you.<br /><br />Review<br /><br />At $199 including a starter toner kit, this printer is an unbeatable value.<br /><br />I ordered on a Thursday with Amazon Prime free shipping, and the printer arrived the following Monday, which I thought was excellent performance on the delivery.<br /><br />The size of the box was my first clue that I should have read about the dimensions more carefully.<br /><br />This unit weighs 41 lb and is about 20% larger (my guesstimate) than the MFC-7820N. The best location is a large office table, it would not fit on the 18" deep wire rack in my "IT Closet." The quick-start guide also mentioned that once located and set up, the unit should not be moved, so I had think through the setup up front.  Eventually I went to Home Depot, had a sheet of plywood cut to 20" x 20", and placed it on the wire rack with a few L-brackets pointing down in the right place to prevent it sliding around. Then I set the printer on top of the plywood, and all was well. This took me a couple of hours and if you have the right space for setup you won't need that time.<br /><br />Once the space thing was figured out, the actual installation, using a Windows 7 laptop, was straightforward and took about 20 - 30 minutes. To answer all the Setup Wizard's questions about the WiFi network in your house, you may need to log into your WiFi router, so make sure you know to do that before you start this setup. No need for that if you are going to use wired ethernet only.<br /><br />After the initial setup, I did not use the included disk for the other computers (iMacs and Mac Airs, running OSX 10.6x. Instead I went to the Brother web site and downloaded the latest OSX drivers. I'm not a very proficient Mac user, so it took a while to get some of these done correctly, but bottom line it was not very difficult and worked flawlessly on Mac Air.<br /><br />One problem: on iMac the latest driver downloaded and installed correctly, but every time we tried printing from the iMAC we got a dialog box that the printer was paused, and to click [some button] to resume printing. After about 10 times unsuccessfully trying, I deleted and reinstalled the driver on the iMac, after which it behaved normally.<br /><br />Since setup this printer has worked flawlessly. After checking a couple of sample prints I decided to buy some better (24 lb) paper for the color printer. It looks good. Both the Brothers will, occasionally, not wake up and print a new job. The quickest way around that is to power cycle or otherwise restart your WiFi network or, sometimes, the printer. This does not happen often enough to be an annoyance.<br /><br />UPDATE, NOVEMBER 16 2011<br /><br />After 2 months with no problems, the Printer started flashing the error message<br />PRINT UNABLE 29. I considered return the unit to Amazon and buy another,<br />however the cost had already gone up from $199 to $229. Also, if this is a design<br />or component failure problem affecting a large batch of machines, the replacement<br />could also have the same issue. Repair would probably be a better option.<br /><br />So I called customer service, and identified the authorized dealer, which is Roberts<br />Business Machines, about 10 miles away in San Jose CA. I took the machine over<br />there. They are a small outfit, very responsive and easy to deal with. The technician<br />initially told me that according to his manual, any one of 3 circuit boards could have<br />failed and that he needed to order all 3 for the repair. Two days later he called to let<br />me know that the factory had instead instructed him to replace it with a new machine.<br /><br />When the new machine arrived I went over there. The box was opened in front<br />of me. Since this was a replacement machine it arrived without the starter<br />toner kit etc. My original toner kits were transferred over. Initially upon startup<br />there were some unexpected lines on the test page, so he cleaned my toner<br />cartridges, after which everything looked normal. I brought the machine<br />back home and repeated the WiFi setup process, and it's been working OK since,<br />about a week now.<br /><br />All things considered although the failure was an unpleasant surprise and I<br />expected the worst at that time, the whole repair experience was quite smooth,<br />though it did cost about 2 weeks' down-time, which was not a problem for me<br /><br />UPDATE APRIL 2012 "Printer Offline" problem and solution<br /><br />This printer developed a new problem - refused to wake up from sleep.<br />When sending a new print job to it, Mac OS reported "printer offline" and<br />Windows XP reported a similar error message after a few minutes. To make<br />the job print I needed to physically turn the power switch off and then back on.<br />I re-installed the Mac OSX 6 driver a few times, with no improvement. So I took<br />the machine back to Roberts Business Appliances.<br /><br />After a day or two the service tech called to inform me that the problem<br />was not reproducible in his shop, it worked fine with both wired and<br />wireless ethernet. After talking to him I learned that he'd manually logged<br />into the printer and changed the network settings to AUTO-SWITCHING<br />and WiFi Communication mode as INFRASTRUCTURE. Unfortunately he'd<br />not recorded what those had been set to during the automatic CD<br />installation but bottom line is, with these settings he saw no problem.<br /><br />I have written down below how to get at and change those and other settings.<br /><br />When I brought the printer home, the wired interface worked fine but<br />the wireless interface was completely non-operational, even after I<br />used the CD automated setup. Clearly, whatever they had changed<br />over at Roberts was not being restored by the CD.<br /><br />Since I had some time on my hands (and did pay for the WiFi interface !)<br />I did some troubleshooting on the WiFi interface and eventually got<br />everything working again.<br /><br />1. Most important: learn how to log into the printer and directly<br />  set up the network configuration the way you want it.<br /><br />  To log into the printer, type its IP address into your browser<br />  window, for example 192.108.1.104, and the browser will<br />  take you to the printer's home page.<br /><br />  How do you find your printer's IP address ? If it's a fixed IP<br />  address, I guess you'll know what that is. Mine is a dynamic<br />  IP address, assigned by the router using DHCP, here's one<br />  way to check it and all of the printer's network configuration<br /><br />  -> At the router front panel, press the "down arrow" button<br />  -> the menu will show "Machine Info"<br />  -> Press the "OK" button<br />  -> Menu will show "Print Settings"<br />  -> Press the "down arrow button again:<br />  -> Menu will show "PrintNet Settings"<br />  -> Press the "OK" button<br />  -> The printer will print 2 sheets of paper<br />  -> "IP Address" is written down near the top<br />  -> Also printed is the status of the wired & wireless interfaces<br /><br />  What if the wireless is not working at all, as happened to me<br />  after I brought the printer home from Roberts ? Simplest thing<br />  is to attach a wired interface from your router to the printer,<br />  wait a few minutes, and then go through the above steps.<br /><br />  (I did not wait long enough: initially the address was 0.0.0.0)<br /><br />  If necessary, you can also use the front panel keys to<br />  manually enter IP address and subnet mask. I did not.<br /><br />OK, now that you've figured out the IP address, log into the<br />printer home page. You now have access to all kinds of<br />useful stuff. For now, click on "Network Configuration"<br /><br />You should see two tabs for "WIRED" and "WIRELESS," one<br />of which shows as "Active" and the other "Inactive."<br /><br />2. The wireless network setting defaults may need to be<br />  changed from what the automated startup CD does.<br /><br />  A few important ones:<br /><br />  - NETWORK CONFIGURATION -> CONFIGURE INTERFACE<br />  option needs to be set to "Auto Switching," so it will<br />  automatically detect and switch between wired and<br />  wireless ethernet<br /><br />  - CONFIGURE WIRELESS - these settings may need to change<br />  depending on your particular WiFi setup at home. I have a<br />  cable modem, connected to a Linksys E3000 router. So my<br />  settings are as follows...<br /><br />  COMMUNICATION MODE set to "INFRASTRUCTURE," meaning<br />  using a WiFi router or access point, not "AD-HOC"  where<br />  your PC directly communicates to the printer, using a WiFi<br />  USB or similar dongle.<br /><br />  Per the technician at Roberts, he has run into the "printer<br />  offline problem before and in all cases was able to fix it<br />  by setting "Auto Switch" and the "Communication mode"<br />  as described above.  He did that to my printer also but<br />  unfortunately did not record the previous state of those<br />  settings the way they were left by the automated CD install.<br /><br />  For the remainder of the settings below... in my case these<br />  had all been originally done correctly with the automated<br />  CD installation, but after bringing the printer back home<br />  the automated CD install did not work any more, meaning<br />  no WiFi access at all until I logged into the printer and set<br />  everything correctly, manually:<br /><br />  SSID name = your home wireless name, eg "Linksys-JohnDoe"<br /><br />  Authentication Method: security must be set to whatever your<br />  home WiFi router is set up for.  In my case,  WPA/WPA2-PSK<br />  and for this option you MUST ensure that you highlight and<br />  CLEAR the hidden contents if any in the WEP Key 1 - 4 fields.<br /><br />  Passphrase = whatever you set up for your home router.<br /><br />After you go through the above (and don't forget hit the "Submit"<br />button), remove the ethernet wire and the WiFi should start working.<br /><br />To confirm you can go through the steps to print the "Network<br />Settings" pages again, it should tell you "Link OK" and other<br />information about the WiFi interface.<br /><br />** Don't forget that the wired and Wireless Interfaces will have<br />different IP adresses. If you want to log back into the printer,<br />check the new IP address on the printout. **;;5.0;;September 30, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

The printer has performed wonderfully over the past year, no issues or breakdowns. Toner life has been well beyond my expectations, lasting just over a year of use. (I typically print a lot of academic, text-focused articles. Graphic-heavy works might use toner more quickly.) Printer speed is great, and even pretty decent using the 2-sided mode.<br /><br />At this point, my only complaint is that the manual feed 'slot' isn't a 'tray'--thus requiring a bit of attention when using. Regardless, I can recommend this printer for home or small-office users who want fast, black and white printing.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />I recently purchased this printer to make printing over my home network easier. Functionally, the printer warms up quickly, text is clear, and it comes installed with some nice fonts one doesn't normally find standard in Windows, such as CG Omega and Univers.<br /><br />Network setup and installation were easy, you do need to have your own ethernet cable, but you just plug it into your hub, then install software from the supplied CD. I had no problems with installing on 98-SE or XP-SP2 (although the XP computer I had to pay attention during installation to make sure the firewall settings were opened for the print spooler).<br /><br />I haven't had the printer long enough to speak on toner life, but we'll see.<br /><br />Two things keep me from giving this printer a perfect review:<br />1) The images of the printer (on HP's site as well as Amazon) make the printer appear to be the same color scheme as the newer HP PC's, the cool silver and gray-blue. However, the printer is an off-white beige and non-bluish-gray. I was looking forward to the more futuristic color scheme.<br /><br />2) When I received mine, the HP logo decal was missing from the front of the printer. The empty space for the logo is a bit annoying. I spoke with HP about this and the service rep was very friendly, but they couldn't send me a replacement logo. My only options were to exchange the printer (at no cost), or live with it.<br /><br />Overall it's a great printer, and the phone service I've received has been courteous. The not-so-cool color scheme and logo fluke aside, I highly recommed it. But spending $500 for a home printer, I expected better attention to details.;;4.0;;November 24, 2004;;23;;23;;1.0

I probably wouldn't use it for heavy duty photo printing on special paper, but that's not what I bought it for.  Canon has a great line of dedicated flatbed scanners that do an excellent job for that.  I bought it for printing and copying and scanning written and printed documents that might have picture on them and it is very suitable for that task.  I never had a Canon printer before.  This one turned me on to the Canon printer line.  I would definitely consider buying another Canon printer copier scanner after having used this one.

Excellent value;;We also own the MFC-9840CDW (great unit as well) and this machine is definitely an improvement in several ways:<br /><br />1. Aesthetics. Looks great!<br />2. Speed. Faster and more responsive in every way.<br />3. Power consumption. This unit only uses 1.6 watts when in a sleep state. Basically when it is waiting for its next print job to come through.<br />4. Networking. Unlike the 9840, I haven't had a single networking issue. I have this connected to a netowork switch via the LAN port with computers all sending print jobs and scan requests.<br />5. Price. I was able to pick this up for less than I paid for the 9840 several years ago.<br /><br />More than this, both units perform excellently with duplex scanning. For those not in the know, duplex scanning is where the scanner automatically scans both sides of the paper at the same time. Therefore, all you have to do is stick in a stack of papers in the document feeder and hit go! This is an uncommon feature for multi-function devices in this price range.<br /><br />Lastly, Brother makes very reliable products. As mentioned, we have owned the 9840 for over 3 years and still performs without issue. We recently donated an mfc9700 after almost 10 years of service, and it was still working when we donated it. Very happy to welcome the MFC-9970CDW into the fold.<br /><br />Important note, we have owned this machine for almost a year.<br /><br />Update 7/18/2012: I feel it is important to let people know that all of my experience until recently was with 3 machines running Windows 7 and that has been flawless over the LAN connection using Brother's software which can be downloaded from their website. I have recently been testing Windows 8 (release preview) on one of the machines and the Brother software fails to install. I called Brother support and they simply stated that Windows 8 is not supported at this time which I can understand as Windows 8 is still in beta. I can get the printer function to work fine over the network using Windows 8's built in discovery utility but cannot get the machine to scan over LAN. The only option I have for that particular computer if I want to use print AND scan is to connect via a USB cable. Hoping Brother is working on Windows 8 drivers as I am very happy with the operating system and I plan to use it on 2 or 3 of my computers.;;5.0;;May 9, 2012;;6;;6;;1.0

There is a small learning curve and sometimes the directions are incorrect, however, once you learn how to use the great features you will be impressed.  I print double sided papers on a regular basis without any issues.  It is a little slow, and decides to clean it's print heads in the middle of a project (???), but speed is not one of my needs.  It was easy to set up.  I can't attest to the photo printing quality yet, as I have mostly been printing lower quality texts.<br />When I first saw the cartridge, I thought it was ridiculous, but I find that my papers are always PERFECTLY straight when I use the tray.  That's great for when I am printing post cards that have to be cut later.  The little screen is OK.  It is convenient, but it could be a little larger.  Fortunately I have good eyesight.  If you forget to open the tray before hitting print it opens it for you.<br />For me, the best feature is the double sided printing.  I use it constantly and it works perfectly.<br />To sum up my random thoughts.<br />Pros- , great features,easy to set up, easy to use once you've done it once, looks great, reliable, no paper jams, borderless printing, straight and true printing and double sided printing<br />Cons- a little slow, small learning curve and sometimes inaccurate instructions, cleans it's print heads in the middle of a print job and screen a little small.<br /><br />Edit---- I haven't been able to find a program that will print a document more than one page at a time, but still have borderless printing. It's a shame. The duplex printing works great but if I need it to be borderless, I still have have print from two Illustrater files, and manually flip the paper over. :(  That's not the printers fault though.;;5.0;;September 26, 2010;;9;;9;;1.0

Brother doesn't tell you this - you just have to find out for yourself after downloading the drivers from the enclosed disk. When it didn't work, I clicked on the "Brother Support" icon on the disk and it took me to their website. When I clicked on the "can't print" link, it explains that this disk does not work for Macs with 10.5 or greater versions. It instructs you to delete the drivers you just loaded and then reinstall the correct drivers from a link on their website. They should have enclosed a note in the set-up instructions explaining this so I wouldn't have had to waste a lot of time trying to figure out why I couldn't print. Once I downloaded the correct drivers, it worked great.<br />2) Hopefully I won't ever have to call customer support because I know from past experience that it's not great.

But none were really needed. Out of the box, just remove all the protective tape, insert the two ink cartridges, fill the paper draw, and then plug it in. Then set it to your wifi network by following the instructions on the printer. It found my network, prompted me for my password, and connected in seconds.

It will work as a network printer, too.  It was clearly designed to work with Windows, but it is also sold as Mac OS compatible, and the User Manual walks you though set-up steps with Windows or Mac OS at the same time. It is thorough.  Thank goodness it's in HTML format, too.<br /><br />I'm a long time HP printer user (30+ years) and I wary of other brands.  But, I haven't had a good experience with HP over the years - they just don't keep their printers drivers up to date (at least, not for Mac or Unix systems).<br /><br />Mac users won't have any problems with this printer, and the Mac installer is included. The printer driver did not include a double sided printing option. You have to be working from one of the Microsoft Office applications, to notice a third line of options called "Copies & Pages" > "Printer Features".  Opening up that list provides all the printer functions like printing form the options sheet feeder (envelope) and you can turn on double sided printing (from the"Layout: menu), if you look carefully enough. You can also choose binding on the long or short side, too.<br /><br />My first mistake was that I assumed the envelope in the single sheet option feeder would give it priority to the main paper bin (as it does on HP printers).<br /><br />While I am impressed that this printer worked right out of the box (no set-up required).  I followed the instructions to the letter, installing the "software" before plugging in the printer.  But, it might as well be using the Generic Postscript driver - nothing special about the driver.<br /><br />While unpacking, it took me about 15 minutes to follow all the colored tape to pull about a dozen plastic shipping pins.  Not real hard, but I was still surprised at how many of those pins where installed.  It is easy to snap off the plastic pins, so use care when removing them.<br /><br />I was not impressed with "pinch and lift" access to the toner drawer - it sticks.  But, I do like the small square toner cartridges, which fit snugly in their respective slots. Each toner box is keyed, so you can mix up the colors.<br /><br />The print quality is excellent.  Finally, I'm printing off web pages that look just like they do on my monitor.  No calibration needed.  That's impressive.  Color copies and photos look great, as well.  If you were used to printing color photos off in B&W on a monotone laser printer, you'll find the color version more interesting.<br /><br />The manual also neglects to point out the importance of using high quality, polished paper for laser printers (probably because HP sells so much of it).  Good paper is really important for sharpness and brightness.  When you print to a bond or cotton stock paper, it will look fuzzy, because of the paper texture.  The printer has an option for gloss, but I haven't tested that with a photo.<br /><br />It copies great, speed is good once it warms up, but warm-up can take 20-30 seconds.  Once it's running, it does good.  I printed out a 40 page PowerPoint file that had heavy black frames.  It often took 30-50 seconds to render a page, but others came out steady.  On a Mac, the PDF rendering is done in software, not through a chip in the printer.  So, some of the delay was no doubt, on the computer end.  However, my Mac Pro has a lot of CPU power and RAM to match.<br /><br />Scanner?  - I haven't found any Lexmark installed Scanner applications, but I was able to choose the scanner from the "Import" function in Adobe PhotoShop and Preview, but not from iPhoto.  It works, but it's a bit awkward.  HP's software takes you directly into a suite of applications that help you edit the picture and print to photo paper of any size, and the have all kinds of printing options like masks.<br /><br />I don't like the rather small, vertical output tray in the back and because of that feature, I did not order the extra paper bin.  You can't expect to stack up much output, before you will need to clear the tray.  40-50 pages, max.<br /><br />The sheet feeder worked perfectly.  If you fax or copy multiple documents, this is a powerful feature.<br /><br />The control panel layout is well done.  The set-up menus are a little awkward to use, but fortunately, you won't have to use the tiny character panel very often (2 rows of 16 characters).  It reminds me of setting the clock on my VCR.<br /><br />The confusion didn't begin until I wanted to order a new set of cartridges.<br /><br />First, they are hard to find in stores.  I checked in every store that sold office supplies and Lexmark printers.  But, even ordering them on-line was difficult.<br /><br />Here on Amazon, they don't have the cartridge listed in their printer cross-reference tool.  (great tool, otherwise, but apparently, it's incomplete).<br /><br />On Lexmark's web site, it doesn't take long to find cartridges, but then you start to think you are getting cross-eyed.  They seem to have cartridges with different amounts of toner (ink) in them!?  Oh, no.  Is this like the way HP was selling Photosmart inks cartridges that weren't full?  I hope not.  When I see a toner or ink cartridge, I expect that it's a full one, otherwise, its impossible to compare prices!<br /><br />So, not only are the toners hard to find, but you need to be very careful that you are comparing the toner capacities and price.<br /><br />The "High Yield Toner" was pre-installed - they do not have a replacement part number on them!?<br /><br />For example, they list:<br /><br />C540X1_G Toner for Extra High yield  (C544 and X544 only)  -$130<br />C540H1_G Toner for High yield  (C540,C543,C544,X543,X544 printers) - $72<br />C540A1_G Toner  (C540,C543,C544,X543,X544 printers) - $58<br />C540X2_G Toner for Extra High yield  (C544 and X544 only)<br />C540H2_G Toner for High yield  (C540,C543,C544,X543,X544 printers)<br /><br />I bought these for regular Toner refills:<br />C540A1CG  Cyan  (Blue) - $58<br />C540A1MG  Magenta (Red)  - $58<br />C540A1YG  Yellow  - $58<br />C540A1KG  Black  (slightly bigger) - $78<br /><br />(*These are NOT Amazon prices - they are current prices for comparison purposes only)<br /><br />Bottom-line, double check before you shop for replacement toner.  This is a very confusing product, in that respect.  Lexmark pushes recycling and the boxes have labels to return the toners.<br /><br />My over all impression is that I really love it.  The copy functions are simple and familiar symbols or labels.  Software (printer drivers) are easy to update - I hope they will!<br /><br />This design is a little bit outdated, but for the price, it's a great way to get into an affordable color laser printer, that is clean, simple, and intuitive.  The only interactive display is a tiny 10 letter display (most new printers have an LCD).  The user manual is in HTML format, so find the menu map and print it out.  You can get there through that tiny front panel, but it takes a lot of time and a little patients.  (I hope it has a Factor Reset option, if I ever mess this up...)<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a very affordable color printer. And, a full set of replacement toner cartridges (a set of 4 can run $3-450) almost costs as much as the original printer.  So, you may not want to stock up on new toner - just plan to buy a new printer.  Seriously!<br /><br />But, don't worry about the printer functions - it's laser sharp.  The ink is durable, but it will smear if you get the paper wet.  It won't survive a coffee spill.<br /><br />Pros:  Solid color laser printer; accurate scanner with sheet feeder, copier functions. Mac drivers.<br />Cons:  Toner is hard to find, confusing/deceptive; no single sheet over-ride; no scanner app.<br /><br />Note: I did not test this printer with Windows.<br /><br />Since I wrote this review, I have upgraded from Mac OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) to 10.7 (Lion).  A lot changed - the scanner function now is found on the printer driver (click on the printer in "Printers" or from the icon on the dock).  The SCAN function is at the top of the usual PRINT window.  Regardless, the scanner function is unreliable - it frequently just quits responding with no error messages.  I have to cycle power on the printer to get it scanning again.<br /><br />Second MAJOR disappointment.  It will not print double sided without jamming.  When I use the single sheet feeder (letterhead or envelopes), it ALWAYS jams and the paper never comes out of the printer.  Something is badly misaligned or designed wrong.<br /><br />FYI:  An office I work in just about the X544 (this year's model of the same thing) and it failed even worse.  Sheet feeder will not work.  They sent it back and opted for an HP that cost twice as much.<br /><br />My high rating (4 stars) reflects the value of the printer.  It's a great printer for single sided work and medium capacity office printing.  Just don't expect the other features to work (i.e. single sheet, envelope or double sided printing).<br /><br />Also, it has developed a squeeky roller wheel after running about two cases of paper through it over 2 years.<br /><br />GOOD Value, just not as feature rich as it would appear.;;4.0;;March 15, 2010;;31;;33;;0.939394

Wireless connectivity allows you to print without needing to be connected via a wire. The printer produces exceptional quality photos as well as crisp and clear documents. The scanner/copier are well-above average. The user interface is simple and intuitive despite being full of features. And finally, the ink is very affordable. What more could you want?<br /><br />More details:<br />Although this is an all-in-one, there is no fax. To me, that's not at all a negative, but if you're looking for a fax this is not for you.<br /><br />The wireless feature is one of those "how did I ever live without this" features. I can sit at my desk and print a document, or I can be all the way across the house and print something and know it will be there waiting when I go to get it. One printer is enough for the whole family -- everyone can access from their own computer.<br /><br />When I think of multifunction printers, I tend to think of a device that can do everything pretty well. This, however, does everything incredibly well. I have printed countless numbers of photos that are at least as high-quality as professionally printed photos. 4x6, 8x10, wallets... everything comes out bright, crisp, clear, and the ink dries immediately so no worries about smearing on your fingers. They've even added the ability to print photos in 3D (which is nice, but mostly just fun to play with for me). The included software also allows you to edit and adjust your photos if you are not using some other photo editing software. The tools are basic but do include most of the simple adjustments you might make. There is a card reader, which makes it nice if you want to print directly from a memory card. You can preview the photos on the LCD screen and select just the ones you want to print.<br /><br />Document quality is exceptional and the print speed is quite fast. Scanning produces clear, high-quality images. There is no document feeder so you do have to lift the lid each time, but the included software makes it easy to quickly scan multiple pages into the same file.<br /><br />The printer also has some nice features you'd expect on higher-priced models. For example, you can print from a set of "printable forms" directly from the printer, without even turning on a computer. No more going to buy a whole pack of graph paper when you need one sheet -- just print your own!  Also, if you start printing a letter-sized document but have forgotten and left 4x6 photo paper in the printer, it will detect this and alert you before wasting your photo paper.<br /><br />The ink is also great. It uses Kodak's new 30-series ink (Kodak Black 30b Ink Cartridge - Retail (8345217) and Kodak Color 30c/Xl Ink Cartridge - Retail (1341080)) It dries instantly, even on those brightly colored photos that used to take forever to dry. It's long lasting and inexpensive, leading to a very low cost per page (the best way to measure ink cost).<br /><br />Overall: exceptional printer, amazing quality, low cost ink.;;5.0;;August 19, 2011;;38;;42;;0.904762

Have uninstalled HP software and re-installed.  Even reset the whole home network.  Other wireless notebooks and other wireless printer all work fine - only this printer will not work.  In searching for solutions on internet I have found numerous complaints about this same issue since December 2011 - at least 8 months now and still no fix from HP for this issue.  When the printer works, the color docs are beautiful but I have had more problems with this printer in just 3 months than all the other printers I've owned for about 20 years put together.<br /><br />The other issue I had with this printer is that 1/2" to 3/4" space is added to all my document margins on the left side of every page and doc is cut off on right side of page.  There is no fix for this problem either - seems to be a printer diver issue.<br /><br />HP Support has no fix for either of these issues and does not seem to be in any hurry to find a solution.  Avoid purchasing this printer until there is a new driver.  Otherwise the wireless feature may fail at any time and document margins change on their own without regard to your software program settings.  If HP could correct those issues, this would be an excellent printer.  Without a driver update, this printer is totally worthless.;;1.0;;August 4, 2012;;8;;8;;1.0

I selected the Kodak ESP C310 because of the supposed ink conservation design of this printer. What a load of misleading adver-hype hogwash. The only reason the cartriges are cheaper than the competition is that they have less ink in them! That is only the tip of the mis-information. I quickly discovered that this printer sucks up a lot of ink even in the BW Draft mode compared to my old HP. Then much to my dismay it quits printing and requires a cartridge change BEFORE  it runs out of ink. I know, I cut one of the "empty" cartriges open, LOTS of ink left! probably at least 10 to 20 copies worth. Just recently I discovered that the evil little printer sucks up color ink EVEN IF YOU ONLY PRINT BLACK AND WHITE! I have used up three color cartriges to 7 black cartriges and have never printed a color print.  I suppose, to be fair, it does make decent prints, but because of the horrible ink consumption This printer is going back to Wally World and I would certainly not recomend it, or any other KODAK product to anyone.;;1.0;;December 15, 2011;;18;;19;;0.947368

Copy, scan, print, color are really excellent. All the Great 5* reviews are from people who've own this Canon 860, 870 series printer less than a month.<br /><br />It's a terrible printer due to tiny ink tanks, and evaporating ink when not in use make this printer a huge waste of YOUR Time And Money. A previous reviewer said "designer should kill him\her self for this embarrassment" and that made me laugh and nod my head. If you print a lot, the ink will eat your wallet as you run through the available tanks  too, too quickly. If you print not very much, the ink will eat your wallet as they quickly go dry while sitting. To try to make this printer affordable, I refill the ink cartridges myself, (buy ink from Amazon) but it turns out that refilling tanks is too annoying because of how frequently I have to do it. (really frequently) I have quit using the printer except for scanning. If any one of the 5 ink tanks goes empty, then printing stops.... even if I just want to print in black.

Awkward to set up if you don't know much about networking... but if you understand what IP addresses are and various wireless network security systems it isn't too bad.  I didn't have ethernet to location where the printer is located, so I needed a printer with wireless capability.<br />2) FAST printing, 20ppm or so, both color and B&W.<br />3) I've had some issues setting up the "scan to folder" feature on our mac's.  Need to play around with it some more.  I think I can get it working, but will require some tweaking.<br />4) OCR software for the mac is poor.  Lots of typos and errors even with clean, simple text.  I suspect the windows software is better.  I mostly needed printing, faxing and copying, so not a big deal for me.<br />5) Great as a B&W copier.  Color copies are somewhat washed out in terms of colors... not unusual for color multifunctions at this price point.<br />6) The mac print drivers are not great for color printing.  The mac print drivers are all open source "CUPS" drivers.  Colors are washed out, not crisp.  Setting it for high quality output and "vivid" color helps for sure.  I'm searching for other driver options.  I'm going to try some print drivers from other brother color printers or gutenprint.  So far... not terribly impressed with the print drivers that come standard for mac.

I decided when my Lexmark printer (was a gift) ran out of black ink I would buy a new printer because Lexmark ink is too expensive and runs out too quickly.  I decided on this printer because it got decent reviews on print quality.  I'm not concerned about photo printing, because I use another service for that.  I like the ease of use of this printer, and I like that it prints fairly quickly.  I was a little concerned about the wireless setup because of the reviews stating it was confusing to set up.  I did not find this to be the case!  I found that once I unwrapped the printer, installed the ink and put the cd in the drive that the on-screen directions were PERFECT!  It told me what to do and when to do it.  I just installed it today, so I can't comment on the ink life or quality over time, but the 20 pages I printed today were perfect.<br /><br />EDIT: As for ink life, I print quite a bit in Black and White, and mostly I use the draft setting for the fastest print time and lowest ink consumption.  I find that printing 15 - 30 pages per week I can get about 6 months on one black ink cartridge, which for me is great performance, and this is considering that when I use the copy function I can't get draft settings.<br /><br />After having the printer for almost a year, I began to have problems with the print quality, I contacted Canon customer support, and after some troubleshooting determined that the unit was faulty.

When I was in college, and at my old work, I used other (higher quality) Epsons, and this one prints look just as good and with the price as cheap as it is, you can't go wrong.  I got some quotes from commercial printers who would print on an Epson for $30 a print!  I would have spent as much get portfolio pieces as I would have from just buying this printer.  Ridiculous.<br /><br />That said, I've come across what seems to be a unique problem.  Everything that I've printed so far as come out a bit larger than it should.  For example, after I cut out a cd booklet I printed with crop marks, which should being 4.75", it came out 1/8" larger.  Other things that should have been 11" x 14" came out about a quarter inch larger.  I just wrote Epson asking about this problem, so I'll have to update once they respond.  While trying to come across others who might have had this problem, I stumbled back upon Amazon, so I thought I might as well write one of these.<br /><br />**Update**<br />So there's a setting in the printer's dialogue box (outside of the program's print menu), called Expansion.  For some reason the default is on "Max," which means that it distorts the print by enlarging it, so that you can have a bleed.  Now I see how Epson thinks of the people it is marketing this printer to: idiots.;;4.0;;May 26, 2009;;5;;5;;1.0

I tried the one in the local Staples but it couldn't find the printer via my iPad. I bought one and brought it home and it didn't see it either. Once I upgraded the firmware and restarted nothing looked different on the screen or in the menus but it appeared just fine on my iPad.<br /><br />I loaded letter sized plane paper in the bottom drawer and 4x6 photo paper in the top slot on the back. When I printed a photo from my iPad it printed full-bleed on the 4x6 photo paper. When I printed a webpage it pulled the paper from the cassette and printed it on plain paper. There was nothing to adjust and it worked better than I thought and it printed quick. The printer was never plugged into a computer either, except for updating the firmware.<br /><br />Only cons I have is that there is no way, to my knowledge, a way to configure media, print settings or any details like that when using AirPrint. I could see why would wouldn't want it on the iOS device or even lots of options on the menu of the printer but please give us some geeky tools for the web admin section of the printer so we can get some better prints.<br /><br />The photos I tried printed out a bit warm and maybe too much red in them.

It was a reliable printer which gave me high quality prints. The Epson Stylus Photo 2200 worked great from day one, and I never had to speak with an Epson tech.<br /><br />I purchased the Epson Stylus Photo R2880 as a replacement printer. It would not print 13" x 19" paper. I kept getting paper jams and error messages stating I was using the wrong media for the paper tray. I spent hours on the phone with Epson techs, who finally told me the printer had a defective paper sensor.<br /><br />I returned the first Epson Stylus Photo R2880 and purchased a second printer. The second Epson Stylus Photo R2880 not only had the same problems, but it also gave me communication errors. I spent another hour on the phone with an Epson tech who refused to call me back as my calling card ran out of minutes.<br /><br />In my opinion Epson has inadequate service techs, poor customer service, and a poor quality product in the Epson Stylus Photo R2880. I believe this printer was never tested in a rush to get it to market. The only reason it even deserves one star is because it prints 8.5" x 11" sheets.

I had a color HP inkjet all-in-one that worked well, except for the fact that ink printers smear and the replacement ink is so expensive.  I stumbled upon this printer and found a way good deal, so I bought it.  When it arrived, I hooked it up to my computer (yes, I have a Mac) and at first had a bit of trouble installing the driver.  I finally figured out that the easiest way was to download the driver from the Oki website.<br /><br />After that, I starting printing like an office supply nerd in Kinkos!  It does everything that I need it to.  It prints pictures with decent resolution.  It prints text wonderfully.  It is silent when not in use, and quiet when it is warming up/cooling down.  This printer is wicked fast (as compared to inkjet) and the start up time is excellent as well.  The toner capacity (thus far) is great.  I have printed 800-1000 pages and we're still plugging away (with the toner that came with the printer!)  I'm already saving money on ink/toner.  It prints many different sizes/styles of paper (including envelope and card stock)<br /><br />Now for the criticisms of the printer.  It does not duplex (both sides) automatically.  I don't have a lot of extra time to manually duplex, so I end up using double the paper I would have if auto-duplex was an option.  Another major criticism that I have, is that it does not do a great job with labels.  I bought some mailing labels for laser printers and the toner seems to wipe off the labels after they're printed.  Who knows, I may have a setting wrong, but this seems weird.<br /><br />Other than that this printer is perfect for what I need to do.;;5.0;;March 27, 2009;;10;;10;;1.0

Based on my install of the unit, client feedback, and my own research, I can confidently say the following about this MFC Laserjet:<br /><br />1.  Brother has the other printer brands outclassed in value, quality, ease of maintenance, and cost per page.  This unit has more features, holds more paper, has better durability reviews, and cheaper toner than ANY other comparable machine anywhere near this price range!  The most wonderful part about the maintenance is that the 4 toner cartridges(of which you can buy extra-large capacity) rest inside the drum unit.  The drum unit simply slides out when you open the front panel and grab it!  The paper tray is a good capacity, duplexing capability is included, can also scan and fax legal size paper in color through the top ADF.  I could go on...<br /><br />2.  Between the toner prices and the ability to buy extra-capacity cartridges, Brother's cost-per-page for black prints is only about 1.8 cents/page + cost of paper (drum replacement at 25,000 page duty cycle factored in!), and color is only about 2.9 cents/page + paper!!

The print quality is good and when it is actually printing, its very fast. But be aware that when these companies proclaim fantastic print speeds, thats only when the page is actually printing. That doesnt seem to include the 30seconds it takes to get its act together before it starts the first page or the long startup times.<br /><br />If you want to use the scanner, you will have to buy a USB cable which is not included (and go through a long set up process). For some reason you cant scan over wifi. But once set up, I like how easy it is to scan from the scanner and how I can scan straight to a PDF.<br /><br />Printing in "Fast Economy" or "Economy" modes is abysmal for color or even gray. I know its not supposed to be as good as "normal" but with the other printers I had, I could still make out the color graphics in those modes. If you try to print a Google map in either of those modes for example, you can barely see it, so you are forced to use "normal" mode just to make out the streets, thereby which using more ink.<br /><br />But those are small things.

I went to Circuit City and Office Max looking for a replacement.  None of the idiot printer experts at either store were aware that they carried a printer under $250 that had a parallel port and an available auto reversing mechanism.  They also were all under the impression that each model of HP DeskJet that could use a auto reversing mechanism had its own special mechanism, so that I could not use my old one.  Finally I decided that I would bite the bullet and get USB connection printer +/- $150.00, a USB hub +/- $30.00, and a USB cable  $15-30, and just forget about the auto reversing aspect.  Before purchasing the approximately $200.00 worth, I went to Sams Club just to check their prices.  (Just before Christmas â" Super long lines)<br />I found they had the same 5650 printer as Circuit City and Office Max.  It was only $10 cheaper, and I almost went back, until I noticed that Sam Clubs printer had a big yellow sticker indicating it included a USB cable.  All of a sudden it was at least $25.00 cheaper.  They also had a hub for only $10.00.  Wow, $45.00 cheaper â" worth the long line after all.  Still not what I really wanted, but it would do.<br />Imagine my surprise on getting home, and discovering the parallel interface.  Then a few minutes later discovering that it would accept an auto reversing mechanism.  The final surprise â" My old auto reversing mechanism fit perfectly.  Well itâs not the same color, but who cares.  Itâs in back and out of site anyway.<br />I thought I came home with a substitute printer that I could live with, and I actually came home with the exact printer that I wanted.  It seems to be faster than my old 970cxi, and the color photo quality on HP photographic (High Gloss) paper seems to be even better even without using the optional 6 color cartridge.  I loved that old 970cxi, but the 5650 is smaller, sleeker, faster and quieter.<br />Great value â" Great printer;;5.0;;December 31, 2003;;8;;9;;0.888889

My home network has 2 wired pc's and 2 wireless laptop pc's . I followed the instructions to hook this up to the network via my Valet wireless printer. That part worked fine,in fact I was able to use a few different methods successfully connecting to the network. The wired pc's printed to the printer via the wireless connection through my Valet wireless router just fine . My wireless laptops are another story. I tried everything possible,and read enough tech help to make me puke. I did get the laptop to access my wired pc and then access the printer through it,but it was not a stable connection and every time the laptop gets rebooted it goes away.and trying that connection method again is only successful maybe 10%.<br />  Basically,in my several years of working on computers and building computers I would have to give this printer a bad review. I have not even tried to hook up the blackberries or ipod touch yet,my head is about to explode as it is.<br />  My best guess to the problem is the Kodak Software connection utility is junk. I updated the software and even updated the printer firmware. That did not help. The connection software just does not work from the wireless laptops,nor does windows built in "add a printer" software work.<br />  I am not perfect,and I may have done something wrong, but I am good at figuring out pc issues, and I spent literally 12 hours over 2 days working on this with no real success. The average home user with less knowledge would have real issues.<br />  So my advice is this....... if you want this printer for a wired connection,or a wireless connection to wired pc's, you are in good shape getting this pc.  If you have a wireless laptop, forget it.  I will come back and update this if I find a way to fix it or Kodak properly updates their software.<br />  Amazon has the best price on this, as usual.

Installation was easy and took about 20 minutes. So far, so good. We'll be using it largely for printing text, school projects, etc.  But I will also printing photos for scrapbooking when I only have relatively few to print and don't want to wait for mail order or don't want to drive to my local retailer to use their photo kiosk.  For my purposes, the print quality looks good on text documents and excellent on photos (Since I'm a scrapbooker so photo quality is important to me.) It prints quickly enough for my needs.<br /><br />But one weird thing that I think I've read elsewhere is that the printer shakes the desk when it prints a text page. My desk is large, made of solid wood and filled with files, extra paper and other supplies so you would think it would stand still as the printer runs. Printing a color web page was quick and quiet. But when I did the text page, the printer was a little clunky and loud and it made my desk shake as the page was printed. Unfortunately, I didn't print a text page in the store when I was doing my research.  I might have chosen a different printer if I had known, but it's not annoying enough (yet?) to make me mad.<br /><br />I'll be moving the printer to a separate stand anyway because the printer is so large, but I hope the printer doesn't make that stand shake as well. I only gave it 4 stars because of the shaking. How many others are having this problem?<br /><br />UPDATING:  11/1/11<br />Uses color ink even when printing in grey scale!  I printed a number of pages today for the first time since I got the printer.  I've printed about 50 or so pages of text that  have large amounts of white space.  The ink levels on the color ink tanks were the same when I started, but when I was done, the ink levels in the cyan and magenta were low and had warnings on them.  How could the color ink run low when I made it a point to choose greyscale printing on every job?  I noticed that the printer does some kind of adjustment between jobs.  I hope these aren't cleaning cycles.  As someone else pointed out, the cleaning cycles use up ink, including color,each time it happens.  Yikes!  Revising my rating from 4 stars to 3.  I'm starting to regret this purchase.  And yes, it also shakes the solid wood media stand that it sits on.  What is up with that?<br /><br />UPDATING:  2/28/12<br />I've only had this printer since October and I just bought my 3rd set of cartridges - all the colors and blacks.  And I've printed fewer than 100 4 x 6 photos!  This thing really does hog up ink even if you mostly print black and white text.  I called Canon Support and they told me that the printer uses the color ink to make a composite black.  Why would they do that?  There are two black ink cartridges in this printer.  I assumed one was for text and one was for photos.  According to Canon Support you can change the printer settings to not use the color ink to make black.  I encourage you to call and complain that these aren't the default settings and ask them how to set your printer up to print using the black ink for black and white pages!!!  And beware that your print quality may not be good based on their instructions.  They won't tell you that you have to play with the "custom" settings to set the print quality to a higher quality.  Even at the higher quality setting, they text is not the dark black you get from the composite black that uses up so much ink.

Ink cartridges are expensive? So the heck what. If you google "250ml refill ink for MG3120" you will find a 4 pack of 250ml bottles, one of each color. WITH instructions, a thumb drill, and 4 injection needles. The directions are straight to the point. My roommate has had his printer here which we share for about a week. Printed off 40+ 4x6" photos and even though the cartridge warning light says it's out of ink, it was still printing. I refilled the cartridges with the ND Brand refill ink from the 250ml bottles and there is NO GRADE LOSS of photo quality. the 4x250ml refill pack is $28.99 Free ship on ebay LOL. I'm estimating about 30-40 refills of each color and double of that for black.<br /><br />Ok so now that we got the expensive/non-expensive ink issue outta the way...On to number....<br /><br />2) Full automatic duplex printing. One word "FANTASTIC" it jammed once the first time we tried it, it pulled 3 pages in at once slightly offset from each one...That brings me to number...<br /><br />3) If your paper gets jammed in the barrel, it's so freaking EASY to unjam the printer. On the back of the printer there is a extremely simple way to open the barrel and pull the paper jam out. It hasn't jammed up again at all.<br /><br />4) Wireless setup, if you follow the directions to the letter, it's simple. If you try to put more than one of these on the same network, you MIGHT have a little bit of an issue if you use the same computer with software installed that you used on the first one. Simple resolution: Uninstall the software, reboot, reinstall :P<br /><br />5) Speed? Faster than most other inkjet printers out there, in my opinion. Definitely faster than Laser printers LOL unless you have a high grade super expensive one :P<br /><br />6) Photo quality, simply as good as sending your photos to walgreens or walmart if not better.<br /><br />7) Haven't had a chance to use the scanner system yet. and the on-device menu has "code" so you have to understand what the codes are, which I don't yet.<br /><br />NOTE: Printer head alignment, don't we HATE having to eyeball which number or letter looks the most solid and do it 2 or 3 times to align the print heads? NOT ANYMORE. What you do is press the "maintenance" button a few times til you see a lowercase "u" then press the color or black go button. it prints an alignment sheet. Take that and place it on the scanner bed as it shows. Hit the go button again, and the printer aligns the heads automatically. Never seen anything like it.<br /><br />Right now we have 2 of these on our home network, and to be honest: Using the ink refills some may be negative about, We don't have a problem with it at all and if it keeps going that way, we'll continue to use it. Even if color laser printers came down in price, I don't think I'd go for one. 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, by far the best printer I've ever had.

Obviously, this is quite irksome. To solve this, you have to decrease the magnification to around 95%, and then figure out exactly where to place the paper on the copy bed so that the left side isn't cut off. OR, I suppose you can decrease the magnification further, but I didn't feel like wasting more paper to figure it out.<br /><br />Printing: Very happy with the quality. No complaints. Both Black and Color printing are good.<br /><br />Scanning: Honestly, disappointed. I scan handmade cards, and on several, the image has been kind of blurry. I don't know if I need to adjust settings or if that's just the way it does it. I miss my old $50 Memorex scanner.<br /><br />INK: This seems to use ink VERY quickly. We don't print color very much and already the color tanks are low (although the color-black and the yellow aren't as low). One interesting thing is that the main-black cartridge indicator has said that it's been empty for several days, although we've been able to print without changing it. We're waiting for the printer to refuse to print before we change it.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's not a bad copier/printer/scanner and it works well enough for our needs, but the drawbacks listed above are a disappointment.;;3.0;;April 14, 2011;;10;;10;;1.0

Initially I had nothing but praise for this printer but within the first 7 months of using it about 40 prints a month or less it started miss-feeding photo paper which became expensive.  It used a lot of ink but I over looked that since photo tends to do that and I was pleased with the results.  However I was not pleased with the misfeeds that became increasingly more common.  Canon kept telling me to turn it off and on, change out the printer cartridges (which I had to go out and buy) and I would be fine.  This was very far from true.  I attempted to review this printer on their website but found out they must not allow poor reviews as mine was rejected even though it was written tastefully and only based on my experiences with this product.  They continued to have me try random things and avoided warrantying the printer.  It is now out of warranty and collecting dust.  I will not buy from Canon again in regards to printers.;;1.0;;May 10, 2012;;13;;14;;0.928571

This week I bought and installed five new print heads - all but black which I replaced last month. The printer worked for one 24" x 36" picture. Then it started blinking - all but the black print heads blink. They are BRAND NEW and just worked fine, now they don't. They are OEM from HP. I tried to get on-line help to resolve the problem, but they would not allow me to sign on without the product code. I put in the serial number which should satisfy them, but no such luck. To get the product code from the back of the printer, I would have to disassemble the roll feed mechanism which is bolted to the back, right over the product label (nice planning). I have suffered with this printer in silence for several years. Today was the final insult.

The envelope was loaded, but there wasn't an OK or GO button.  When you hit the button on the top of the machine, the red error light stops blinking, but it also cancels the print job.

That's what I wanted - a wireless mobile printer. I know I should have checked further and found the other models with all the capabilities. But I didn't. This "moblile printer" has to be plugged in to 115 V, because it has no battery. (Batteries are extra, or are included with an upgraded model.) It also doesn't come with a wireless adapter card - Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. (Wireless adapters are extra, or are included with an upgraded model.) So, this "mobile printer" has to be plugged in to the wall and to your computer. That doesn't make it very mobile. In fact there are great ink jets for 1/2 the price that are available if you want to plug in cables. The CF slot on this printer is Type I, which is not noted anywhere on Amazon. The industry standard Wireless G cards are Type II, so they don't fit. Only the special HP Wireless G card is Type I, but even that isn't noted anywhere on Amazon. Buy the HP 460wf (wi-fi) or the HP460wbt (Bluetooth) instead. They include a battery and a wireless card. By the way, the printer itself is very good.

My inkjet printer worked okay, but it tended to run out of black ink really quickly.  Plus, the printer didn't support the high-capacity cartridge that my parents' higher-end printer used, so I was buying 2-3 black cartridges a year.  They went on my Christmas list, for heaven's sake!<br /><br />Enter Brother HL-2140.  I found it for a decent price (not here at the time, the going price seems to shift like sand w/rebates and all).  I calculated my inkjet was costing me 10c/pp while this unit (with high capacity toner) would cost a mere 1.2c/pp.  It spins up in about 10 seconds, page curl is noticeable but tolerable.  Print resolution is very good (and no ink smears).  I have not experienced the problem of feeding pages that just printed back through for duplexing and having them jam as some people have.  I just feed back through and it works fine.<br /><br />The footprint is small for a laser--one of the smallest I've seen (but not the absolute smallest).  It did emit a "pine tree" smell for the first few prints, but that's gone away.<br /><br />This printer plugs in and works without an install CD with Windows 7 x86 and x64.  However, Windows 7 will not install the most functional driver.  It will work just fine, but there will be no options for tonersave, duplexing and the like.  Get the driver from Brother.  Oh, and the driver (both) are Device Stage capable.  Works fine as a shared USB printer over a network (even with hacked DD-WRT routers acting as wireless bridges).  Note that the printer itself does NOT have network capabilities--it has to be plugged into a PC.<br /><br />Nagging Complaints: Does not come with a USB cable (I knew this in advance but it reminds me of toys or accessories that need batteries, but come without them).  There is no way (that I know of) to view the exact toner level without using "Print Settings" in the control panel (and thus using more toner).;;5.0;;October 15, 2009;;5;;5;;1.0

I bought it to replace a Brother 440cn that I had for 4 years. The document feeder on that machine stopped working and for the price and many extra features, I decided to get the J615w. I've had many printers over the years and currently have an HP photosmart that I bought because It had better photo printing than my old brother. The thing I have found with each Brother MFC I have had is that they are really easy to set up. Both Windows 7 and Mac OS X see them and pretty much set up everything for you since the drivers are already in the operating systems. You only have to install the added software if you need it and I highly recommend it.  This ease also extends to wireless setup. Windows XP requires you to use the included setup disk but everything worked the first time. I mean everything works! Printing, Scanning, Faxing, Copying are all easy to use and give great output. I see very little difference in photo printing between it and the HP which cost me twice as much and only prints. I hardly every use the HP anymore unless I have a lot of photos to print (which is seldom) because it is faster than the J615w. Which brings me to one of the negatives. It is faster than its predecessor, but overall slower than other printers I have used. If you need fast prints and don't need the best quality it does print faster in fast mode and uses less ink. Another down side is the somewhat flimsy paper tray. It's the same one used on the older 440cn and I had hoped that Brother would have improved it, but at least I'm used to it. I hope the next upgrade will improve on this. These are my only negatives and the reason I didn't give it a perfect score. It is definitely for home or small office use. If I needed higher speed and better paper handling, I would definitely step up to one of Brother's higher models. And I will stick with Brother because I have had great experience with each one I have owned. I have recommended their multifunction machines to all my friends and family and all have had the same results that I have had. Loaded with features, Great output, Easy to setup, Great price and it even looks beautiful in its shiny black with a large flip up color screen, all make up for great value.;;4.0;;March 10, 2011;;20;;20;;1.0

Or maybe you're sick of how much of a racket certain printer companies are. Selling you printers that are cheaper than the ink refills they require? Yep. I was like you once.<br /><br />I'm not proud of the things I've done. I threatened my printer with a baseball bat. I hung it out a window, dangling by its cord after it taunted my by printing an advertisement for ITSELF when all I wanted it to do was print out a page of my choosing. Maybe you know what I mean. Maybe you too have screamed at a printer because it kept telling you its Cyan levels were low, even though you only wanted to print black and white.<br /><br />But those days are over.<br /><br />I didn't like the kind of person I was becoming. I took a chance. I bought a Brother printer. I thought, maybe laser printers are a better way to go. Since Brother offers this printer at such a reasonable price, I figured if it worked out, it was worth the investment. It turns out I was right. No longer do I go to sleep with bloodied fists, broken and cut from fighting ink jet printers. No more will the sound of mechanical screams haunt my nightmares.<br /><br />Today is a new day. I wake up. Sometimes I print, sometimes I don't print. But it's always on MY terms. I got a high yield toner cartridge to replace the one that comes with the printer. It's been over a year, and I still haven't had to change it. It isn't even telling me I'm low on ink. I'm writing a book. I print out hundreds of pages of text. Oh, another thing that's amazing about this printer? Auto duplexing. That's right, I said it.<br /><br />So go ahead. Take a chance.

It wasn't until I had it unpacked, plugged in, ink cartridges installed, printer heads aligned, and the drivers installed on my computer that I read on the enclosed instruction book that the USB cable was not included. It's only a $2-3 cable on Amazon, but this is false advertising at it's worst.<br />  On the Amazon item page, it indicates that the printer communicates to the PC using a "high-speed" USB cable, but nowhere does it mention that this cable is not included. I would not care so much if it were advertised on the order page. It would be a little cheap and ridiculous even then, but at least I wouldn't have to wait FIVE MORE days for the cable to arrive. I didn't set up the printer until I was ready to make a label for a DVD I was about to put together, but now I HAVE to wait for the USB cable that Canon decided to shirk on.

The R3000 is half the cost and almost exactly the same except for it's narrower 13" maximum print width (vs the 17" 3880). Both use the "UltraChrome K3 with Vivid Magenta" ink set which is the same one used by almost all of Epson's "Pro" line of printers. Honestly, I don't know why the R3000 isn't in their "Pro" line since it could reasonably be used by a pro who never needed to print anything wider than 13".<br /><br />I printed some color test charts at the Sam's Club photo lab (which should be reasonable quality since they actually calibrate their printers at least once a day and when they change paper rolls) and on my R3000, then compared them to an actual X-Rite produced ColorChecker chart, and the output from the R3000 significantly beats the output from Sam's Fuji Frontier minilab photo printer. The Fuji Frontier print is noticeably duller with generally darker colors and a narrower range of saturated color reproduction. You don't have to be a color expert to see the difference.<br /><br />For the R3000 the ink cost is about $1/ml which comes out to about $0.01 per square inch if you get it at a discount (search for "red river Cost of Inkjet Printing Epson R3000"). That makes a borderless 8x10 cost about $0.80 in ink, and a borderless 8.5x11" cost about $1 in ink. A sheet of Epson Ultra Premium Photo paper costs as little as $0.60 if you get it at a discount, so printing a borderless 8.5x11" ends up costing as little as $1.60 in supplies. (Not to mention that you can get third-party paper that's just as good or better than Epson's official paper for less money.)<br /><br />The cheapest photo labs charge around $1.50 for an 8x10 (my local Sam's Club currently charges $1.46). If we use a whole 8.5x11 sheet of official paper and a full 8x10 worth of ink to print an 8x10, we get $1.40 in supplies per 8x10 which is slightly cheaper than even Sam's Club and significantly higher quality. Good third-party paper would be around $0.35/sheet meaning that you could also do as well as $1.15 per 8x10, maybe even better.<br /><br />Admittedly though that doesn't incorporate the cost of the printer, which you won't have to incur if you just use a photo lab. If you bought the printer for say $800 and you've gotten your per-8x10 supply costs down to $1.15, then you'd need to print about 2,580 8x10's before your total costs started to get lower than Sam's Club's $1.46.<br /><br />When you get larger than 8x10 though then the printer really starts to pay off. One place online that isn't too expensive and has a good reputation charges $6.30 for a 12x18 on glossy photo paper printed with a photographic lab process. It's possible to get decent 13x19" gloss ink jet photo paper (same stuff that costs $0.35/sheet for the 8.5x11) for about $1.50/sheet. 12x18" of ink costs you $2.16 so total cost for a 12x18 on the R3000 with that paper is $3.66. At that price you need to print 300 or so of these large prints before your prints start costing less than $6.30, and again the ink jet prints will have better color quality than the photographic process printer. You also have the entire lifetime of the printer to make all these prints that we're talking about. If you make on average about 10 8x10" prints every week then it would take about 5 years to make this cost back, but if you made two of the 12x18" prints per week then it would take about 2.8 years to brake even compared to the lower quality protographic process prints ordered online.<br /><br />But none of these estimates take into account the value of the convenience and additional quality you get from having a modern photo inkjet printer right in front of you. Add in costs like transportation to pick up photos, time spent driving, any sort of cost of inconvenience by having to wait for prints to arrive in the mail, the additional value of better color quality, and other hard to quantify things then the real savings may be better. Depending on how much these costs add to the cost of photo lab prints, a decent ink jet printer like this might pay for itself much more quickly.<br /><br />Still, you have to keep in mind that owning your own printer like this only makes sense if you're going to be doing a certain volume of printing. If you only ever print maybe 10 8x10s a month then the printer will never be worth it solely from a cost-per-print savings perspective. Also, if all you ever print is 4x6 then even just your ink cost without paper is going to be around 2.5x the cost of getting 4x6 prints made ata cheap online lab or drug store. So for small prints like 4x6 the printer will absolutely never pay for itself from the supply perspective, and probably not even from the convenience perspective.<br /><br />The only problems I've heard of with this printer seem to involve priming the print head (pumping ink into the initially empty hoses that run from the ink cartridges to the print head, basically) and the printer going through unnecessary cleaning cycles, but Epson support is great about addressing these. My R3000 went though an unnecessary priming cycle when I first set it up, wasting about half the ink in the cartridges. Support got back to me in less than a day and offered to send me a full set of full replacement cartridges. I haven't seen anyone complaining of clogged nozzles or any of the usual inkjet problems.<br /><br />The color gamut of the R3000 when used with the Ultra Premium Photo paper significantly exceeds the AdobeRGB colorspace in areas of dark blues and greens. This allows you to make the most of your camera's sensor capabilities IF you convert your RAW files into a format using the ProPhoto RGB color space (the most common one that actually holds those colors) AND print to the printer using proper color management with the appropriate ICC profile. Photo labs almost always require all files to be encoded as sRGB (which is smaller than both AdobeRGB and ProPhoto RGB), and printers like the Fuji Frontier have smaller gamuts than sRGB anyway, so they can't possibly achieve the wide range of colors that a high quality professional inkjet can when it's wielded by someone with sufficient color management skill.<br /><br />Anyway, excellent printer, reasonable cost of ownership and operation, higher quality printing than you get at a photo lab, convenience, and excellent support from Epson. When you consider this part of your "digital darkroom" and compare its cost to the cost of materials and equipment you'd spend for an "old fashioned" film darkroom, the cost is quite reasonable.;;5.0;;December 2, 2011;;70;;70;;1.0

The HP stopped printing the bottom of pages (regardless of margin settings) and finally stopped using the black cartridge altogether, even after trying to clean the ink head and line.<br />Because I print a lot of documents for legal purposes, I needed a good reliable printer, substance over form. Fortunately, the MX870 allows me to minimalize my compromises.<br /><br />First off the price is unbeatable for the feature set. A comprable HP will cost at least twice the MSRP for this unit.<br /><br />I like the way the printer looks. Grays and blacks (which I prefer to the white of the HP) and good backlighting on the control panel are pluses but I really appreciated just the general impression of superior craftsmanship I get when looking at the Canon. Also, the bays all are retractable, and leave the printer closed up and protected from dust and dirt, when not in use. This is a big improvement from the permanently open bays of the HP C7280.<br /><br />Printing is a breeze. Very quiet, fast, and great quality. I was a bit worried about a drop off from the HP, since it is touted as a "photo" printer. My fear proved to be unfounded, however, when I printed a couple of high contrast pictures and they came out looking excellent. And it prints ALL THE DOCUMENT, even when the margins are shorter. Scanning and fax are also easy to use and functional.<br /><br />The ink catridges have a good life expectancy. I have been printing a lot of documents and the small black cartridge is only about halfway used so far and the colors all still read full.<br /><br />Set-up is easy and the software is not cumbersome to use. Setting up my Canon on the home wireless network was a breeze. The Canon software is not even close to being as massive and bloatware-heavy as the HP software that never seems to get off of your computer.<br /><br />However, this leads me to my only gripe about this unit: NO OCR SOFTWARE! Come on, Canon, why did you stop with the OCR? Scanning a document to Word is a very useful function and one that the HP handles easily. However, for some reason Canon does not support it.<br /><br />In conclusion I am very happy with this unit. For half the price, you get twice the printer compared to the HP C7280. I can live with the OCR issue, as it is not a deal-breaker for me. This is my first Canon printer in a long time and I am impressed and thankful that there is a good value alternative to HP.<br /><br />EDIT: Have used this product for almost 2 months now and I still stand by my review.<br /><br />5/17/2012 UPDATE: Had this printer for over a year now and I still stand by my review.;;4.0;;February 21, 2011;;6;;6;;1.0

The issue I have with this printer is that whenever I try to print 11 x 17 border-less prints, it pushes the paper out at an angle.  It almost is as if the printer doesn't know what to do with the paper once it gets to the edge.  This is an extremely frustrating issue for me, the only way I can get the prints not to be ruined is to print them with borders.  Because of this any piece that I print does not come out the way I intended.<br /><br />This is a good printer as long as you don't intend to print all the way to the borders.  Even that wouldn't be such an issue to me if it were not for the fact that I bought this printer as a more cost effective way for me to print out my portfolio pieces.<br /><br />P.S.  I noticed someone earlier wrote a review that mentioned an issue with lines, you can correct that issue by simply telling the printer what type of paper you are printing on and set it to maximum dpi.;;3.0;;February 28, 2010;;10;;10;;1.0

With the UltraChrome K3 pigments, you can get long-lasting prints that will impress for years to come.<br /><br />My problem with the R2880 is bang-for-buck.  This printer GUZZLES ink like a large SUV.  At a cost of $100+ a set of ink carts, this printer becomes expensive fast.  It loves to go into cleaning sessions on its own, and it will soak through your inks quickly.  After 20 or so A3+ prints, you're probably out of light magenta and desperate for black.  This is a horrible printer for university settings or the casual home user, as it's just too expensive to maintain.<br /><br />If you're looking for the best of the best, this is definitely up there, but if you're a price conscious person, look at the Canon Pixma Pro9000 for MUCH lower ink consumption with nearly identical color accuracy.;;3.0;;August 23, 2010;;18;;19;;0.947368

So far, I'm quite pleased with this printer, although I was disappointed to learn that I can't print wirelessly from a computer that happens to be connected to a company network through a Virtual Private Network (VPN).  Disconnecting from VPN allows wireless printing, but while on VPN, a USB connection must be maintained in order to communicate with the printer.<br /><br />Other that that disappointment, we're very pleased with the printer so far.  Although we haven't yet used it for any photo prints, the quality of the documents produced is more than acceptable, the scanning feature works extremely well and we really like the ability to preview our copies prior to printing.  Printer criteria and how well this printer met each follows:<br /><br />Wireless:  Met criteria with the exception of the VPN issue mentoined above which I suspect is true of all wireless printers.<br />Scanning options (to computer or USB stick):  The scanning feature works quite well and, if I don't happen to have the printer connected to a computer, I can scan documents directly to a memory card or USB memory stick.  I really like having this versatility and, having tested both options, found it to work very well.<br /><br />Small footprint:  We sometimes take our printer when traveling in our motorhome, so had a maximum size based on capacity constraints.  This unit has one of the smaller footprints, is low profile and has a nice look so we can leave it visible while still maintaining a neat, appealing look in our living space.<br /><br />Reasonable print quality:  Although we haven't printed any photos since we acquired this machine, one of our in-store tests involved using a the same photo to create copies on each machine we were considering in stores.  That approach made it quite easy to compare photo quality from one printer to another.  This unit generated very high quality photos that seemed to more closely compare to the original than most of the other printers we tested.<br /><br />In all, we're so far quite pleased with our purchase - only reason for the 4 star rating is the inability to use while connected to VPN (and HPs failure to note that in their literature) and the inability to scan multiple page documents to a single file while using a memory stick ( this can be accomplished using the scan to computer option).;;4.0;;December 12, 2010;;27;;27;;1.0

But I purchased it from other than Amazon.com and I'm glad I got this model. Unlike the 1 star reviews here report, setup was amazingly simple. It tells you in the setup guide that it takes up to 20 minutes for the final step (printing of the alignment pages) before you install the software. Could it be that some might not have waited until the machine was fully initialized before installing the software?<br /><br />I put the ink cartridges in, plugged in the power cord, turned it on, waited for the alignment pages to print (close to 20 minutes) and it was good to go. I looked on the color display of the OfficeJet and it had located my wireless network and was waiting for me to input the password via the touch screen. After the password was entered I ran the software from the included CD and was up and running. I then installed the HP software from the CD on my other computers and now can use the OfficeJet from any of my other computers.<br /><br />I did however contact support because although the graphics programs I use found the OfficeJet I could not scan directly into the programs. One quick call and I found out I needed to hook up the included USB cable also to use the OfficeJet as a Twain device in my graphics programs. It took longer to supply the information of who I was and the model & serial number than to get the instructions I needed. The phone call was quick and painless and solved that issue.<br /><br />Now I have only been using this for 4 days. But I have put it though its paces. I have tried every feature. I first thought the auto-duplexing was faulty but it prints one side then waits for the ink to dry before continuing to print the other side. The included scan software is most useful. A nice feature is it allows you to scan a page and then add pages to the scan before saving, so one PDF file can contain many different scanned pages. The Auto feed works flawlessly. I scaned a years worth of my monthly bills, twelve pages at a time (electric, water, gas) into separate PDF files. It never jammed or miss feed.<br /><br />I could not be happier with this machine. I only hope the ink cartridges stand up to a fair amount of printing before needing to be replaced. I will see how this holds up over time and will edit this review if the good times don't last.<br /><br />*Just to be clear, my model is the a910a the one listed here on Amazon is the a910g (Plus) from what I can tell the only difference is the Plus has a larger flatbed scanner.<br /><br />10 July 2011 - Update after 6 months use. Wow six months of use, I have not had one hiccup from this machine. For crying out loud I have never owned a printer that didn't at least miss feed once in a while. OK maybe I'm not using the printer part of the machine as much as some might, as I have not had to replace the ink cartridges yet. But I use the heck out of the scanner, and its flawless. This thing has been rock solid on my local network, a real work horse. I could not be happier with this device, money well spent! I don't get to say that often enough.

For personal use, this is one of the best I've had.  Very satisifed with the print quality and overall speed, although the duplexing is not that fast.  Still, to get automatic duplexing at under $100 was a real deal.  (I paid $90 with free next business day delivery.)  It is somewhat noisier than my last HP printer (a Deskjet 6980 wireless) but none of the inkjet printers I've used were what I would call quiet.  (Even my Epson RX500 3-in-1 isn't perfectly quiet.)  Installation was easy - about 1/2 hour from out of the box to the printed test page.  (For what it's worth, my operating system is Vista Home Premium 64 Bit Service Pack 2 running on an HP laptop with AMD Turion X2 Ultra Dual-Core Mobile ZM-82 processors at 2.2 Mhz with 4 GB DDR2 RAM.  I also took their advice to temporarily disable my anti-virus software before performing the installation.)  When I installed it on my regular PC (which is also from HP and runs Vista Home Premium 32 Bit Service Pack 2 with similar Intel dual-core processors and 4 GB DDR2 RAM), all went smoothly without disabling the anti-virus.  It was found on my in home network without difficulty and ready to use in roughly 15 minutes.  I don't know if computer brand, operating system, processor type and speed or amount of RAM made the difference and allowed me to avoid the nightmare one person had and the agonizingly s-l-o-w set-up reported by another.<br />My one minor gripe is the antiquated requirement of physically attaching the printer to your computer in order to transfer network settings as part of the installation.  My Deskjet 6980, which this printer is replacing, had the really useful feature of being able to get network settings from a flash drive plugged into the front of the unit - like front AV connections on TV's.  If I didn't have a laptop, it would have been much harder for me as I have little room to spare where my regular PC is set up and, as has been mentioned by others, this is not a small, tuck it in a corner printer.  Fortunaely the 6980 didn't have a small footprint either - the only difference between the two being that the duplexing unit adds a couple of inches to the overall depth of the 6000.  It's a little tight where I have it, but it beats running up and down stairs to my Epson all to heck!<br />All in all, however, I would recommend this printer as being a really good bang for the buck!;;5.0;;November 11, 2009;;10;;10;;1.0

Out of the box this HP has proven to be a disappointment as to the quality of the product and the print results.<br /><br />The printer has a fairly large footprint requiring more space than similar Canon and Epson printers I've used.  It is extremely noisy and grinds loudly through the print cycles particularly when a change is made in the type of document being created.  As with most inkjet printers the ink tanks are quite costly and for this printer availability appears limited at some of the more common resources.<br /><br />Comparing the quality of the photos run on both this printer and an older Epson Stylus Photo R200 I have the Epson creates a much superior finished photo on photo paper.  The same is true when printing photos on plain paper - as one might do in a newsletter.  The HP produced pictures that were less sharp and the colors were muddy.<br /><br />Text printing is reasonably acceptable.  The documentation except for a "how to" sheet for set up is very minimal and you have to go to the accompanying CD to get more info or visit HP's web site.  While the printer has convenient buttons and lights to provide ink status and basic operations and a nice design the output falls short of expectations.<br /><br />While the initial price is attractive, with the manufacture's ink so pricy it quickly becomes an expensive printer.  The printer does not come with any connecting cords other than the AC power cord and box that coverts it to a lower voltage, so expect to have to purchase a USB cable unless you are fortunate enough to already have the style required.<br /><br />This one goes back.  For photos on any type paper seems Epson is a better choice in inkjet printers.;;2.0;;October 2, 2009;;45;;54;;0.833333

As for INK, I do not know if it will use more ink than my HP. I saw here that you can buy ink for the Canon for a few bucks. I am thinking about buying another & putting it away as a back up.

This is a hideous printer. I've had it for 4-5 months and finally couldn't take it any longer and purchased an HP Officejet Pro 8600 last week. The quality of the print-outs is below average nor is the Brother a user-friendly machine. It's flimsy, not well made. When opening the compartment doors to clear a paper jam or change ink cartridges I've worried the plastic would break.<br />  Half the time when I attempt a copying function, the fax machine turns on instead. Paper jams easily, clears with difficulty, and it's hard to clear the error message. And it seems you can't even turn the printer off to clear an error message. It tells you the printer is "busy" and won't turn off.<br />  I've had an annoying message appear on my computer screen every 2 minutes or so for the last couple weeks telling me the printer ink is low. It isn't. I replaced the low cartridge but can't clear the message. I've followed their trouble-shooting guide to no avail. The speed of the printer -- or lack thereof -- is astonishing. Black and white print-outs are slow, a color print-out can take 4 or 5 minutes per page, during which it makes a heck of a lot of noise.<br />  The only reason I've given it one star is that it does turn on and eventually you can get something out of it, but it's painful. Buyer beware. The knowledgeable salesperson who advised me about a printer to replace this one said that Brother makes a great laser printer but NOT inkjet.;;1.0;;May 19, 2012;;18;;23;;0.782609

And it can help you save a lot of money of you really want the all in one capabilty. Read on and i'll explain how an why.<br />First things first, the printer is way smaller than the HP Laserjet 2840 i own too, it's not heavy at all, and it looks great. The text printing on this Epson truly looks like a laser printer. The color is fantastic to, i even print photos on glossy photo paper and they look amazing. The scanner is fast and very good too. It allows you to scan and print both sides of docs at once, no manual interference needed.<br />I was looking for a printer that would give me great photo printouts as well as it could be used as a work printer since i do print lots of documents as well. I also wanted to buy a Fujitsu Scansnap 1500 for fast double sided multisize document scanning capabilities, Well this epson gives me all that and much more, and for less than half what the scansnap costs. I use adobe acrobat pro to scan docs to PDF directly from the epson scanner(could not do this with the scansnap) and all that is done wirelessly, i can also fax any document right from my computer just like i print them.<br />Bottom line, for $200 you're getting a very fast high quality printer scanner fax and both-sides copy machine as well as the card readers and a lot more, the ink seems to last, and this printer comes with the highest capacity cartridges, which seem to yield a lot. So now i solved my scanning, pc faxing and photo printing needs all in one small very good a nice machine. And i saved whatever a photo printer costs, plus the $430 for the scansnap s1500, and i get laser quality text as well as (N) wireless conectivity from my printer. What else could i ask for?<br /><br />Note: My comparison with the scansnap s1500 are not based on web reviews, i actually bought a scansnap which i later returned since i get the same if not better results with this printer.<br />Also, i've owned canon photo printers and i still have a huge HP color laserjet 2840. So my comparisons and references are based on actual usage of all equipment mentioned.<br />My recommendation, buy this one and you'll be very pleased.;;5.0;;January 25, 2011;;90;;95;;0.947368

I did not plan on even considering another HP printer since the last HP I had deployed had a number of problems, most of them related to extremely bad Windows drivers and print software.<br />I was strongly leaning towards the Epson 845 Workforce printer, but I thought it made sense to do a comparison with the HP since it also seemed to have all of the features that I needed.  After doing a head to head evaluation between the Epson and the HP 8600 I ended up going with two of the 8600 units.<br /><br />My criteria was that I needed well built all-in-ones that had relatively low operating costs, worked well with Macs and PCs as well as iDevices, had to have good fax and scan capabilities and, very importantly, had to be pretty well built so that in a busy dental practice the unit would not fail prematurely.<br />I did a direct "bake off" in which I purchased an Epson Workforce 845, and an HP 8600 and ran both of them through their paces.<br /><br />In the end I chose the HP 8600 over the Epson Workforce printer.<br />Why?<br /><br />The biggest detriment to the Epson Workforce printer is that it is relatively cheaply built.  It has flimsy paper trays that don't feel particularly solid.  The entire printer actually weighs about 50% of what the HP 8600 weighs.  While `weight' is not a direct indicator of product quality, on something like a printer, which gets a lot of mechanical use of the paper trays and ADF, a more solid feeling, heavier unit, should usually hold up a bit better to normal wear and tear.<br /><br />In other comparisons I observed that the Epson had better draft quality, but the HP was much faster, and seemed to use less ink when it was used in the economy/draft mode.  In Photo printing, neither printer was outstanding, but both would meet our needs for printing casual snapshots or business type photo materials on glossy 4X6 print paper.<br /><br />The single biggest `deal killer' for me with the Epson 845 is that Epson has very lackluster Mac drivers, and their `network scan to PC' software does not currently work with Macs newer than OS X 10.5, which is going on 3 years old.  Epson's inability to update this software (they claimed a new version was in testing) left me with an extreme lack of confidence that if we discovered problems with the Mac OS X software or drivers, that Epson would be prompt with fixing the issue.<br /><br />We also liked the touch-screen on the HP 8600 much better (although sometimes it's a little too sensitive) than on the Epson, as it was larger and could be angled easily.  A final advantage of the 8600 was the included e-print capabilities, such as the ability to set the printer up with its own free HP email print address, so that people can simply send an email directly to the printer with an attachment and have it print emails, pdf files, word documents, etc.  We were also able to easily set the HP up to archive faxes to a network share, as well as creating a "one touch" scan option where the office can scan documents directly to a network share, which is really handy for archiving documents as well as when a receptionist scans something in but someone else on another PC will need to look at the document later.<br /><br />Another plus to the 8600 that's worth mentioning is that ink tanks are loaded directly into the front of the unit.  Simply open up the front service door, and the tanks are ready to be changed.  This beats having to open up the whole printer (as is the case with the Epson and Canon units) and another, added bonus, is that the HP ink tanks are sealed until they are installed into the unit, meaning no smeared or dripped ink from popping off tabs and other parts on the cartridges when you are getting ready to put them in.<br /><br />What's not to like about the 8600?  Not a whole lot, but there are some nits.  If I fax directly from the machine, using my Ooma phone service, I can dial a *99- which dials *99 to disable the Ooma features, followed by a pause, and faxing works.  However, dialing the same way with the print to fax feature on my Mac, does not work, I suspect a problem with the print drivers for OS X.  Fortunately I don't do a ton of print-to-fax jobs, so it's not a deal killer.<br /><br />I do not like how deep the 8600 is with the output paper tray extended for regular size paper.  It's deep enough that in the office location I put it in I am nervous that one of the employees could come around the corner and smack into the paper output tray, possibly breaking it eventually.  I should also point out that the ADF slide adjusters have a little bit of a gap so if you are persistent it is possible to accidentally insert the paper UNDER the ADF feeder, I have also observed that the way this printer feeds documents in to the ADF tends to pull the paper in and crease it, resulting in crooked scans, so it's important to make sure that the ADF guides are snug against the paper you are loading for scan.  This is the first printer I have owned in years that has had this kind of a problem, but since I have two of these and they both work this way I know it's not a defect, but a design issue.<br /><br />Other than that, I don't have too many complaints.  The ink tanks seem to last a really really long time and they are relatively inexpensive when bought in bulk at our local warehouse store.  The costs so far appear to be roughly half of what we were spending on toner for our Brother color laser printer, so the printer will pay for itself in just a few months.<br />All in all we are quite happy with these.  It's worth noting that I bought one HP 8600 Plus and one Premium.  I wanted to add the second paper tray to the 8600 Plus and discovered that I could actually order it from Provantage for about $59 shipped, it's too bad Amazon doesn't sell this part.;;4.0;;February 8, 2012;;8;;9;;0.888889

The rep stated "the ink is so much cheaper." And he was right.  1/2 the price of other inks, to be exact.  Ah, but "cheap is as cheap does" as they say. The printer is not worth the cheap price of the ink.  The first problem is the horrible directions - they appear to be very poor translations.  One poor translation was so bad that I had to hunt on the internet to discover that what Kodak was referring to was the password.  Then, setting up the wireless was beyond frustrating.  I called Kodak and spent 4 hours (yep, 4 hours) with the rep to set up the wireless.  If I weren't so frustrated it may have been kind of funny.  Never mind.  It will NEVER be funny.  Then there were problems with putting the paper in the slot.  Carefully I would load the paper in, and the printer would keep saying "error."  Finally, with no one using the printer, suddenly I got an "error" message saying I had jammed paper.  No jams.  I called Kodak (I dreaded this) and after 40 minutes of nonsense instructions, it was suddenly determined I had a "bad printer."  I was instructed I would have to send it back, but I would get a new printer.  Sort of.  I had to "remove the print head from the damaged printer" because the new one would not have one.  What? I wondered?  Are they kidding?  I will probably GIVE the replacement away.  I certainly will NEVER purchase a Kodak printer again.  As an aside, I had an Epson printer for 6.5 years, and purchased another Epson.  I had that one 4 years, but decided that it was getting a bit older, and wanted the fax feature, although it worked fine.  Sometimes more bells and whistles are not as good as a solid printer that works well.;;1.0;;May 27, 2011;;7;;7;;1.0

It always made a lot of noise when powering up (I think this is inherent with this model; I also have a Brother 2070N printer that sounds similar).<br /><br />The power up noise grew progressively louder (sounding like a jet on the runway powering up for take-off) and caused the office lights to flicker and knocking out my DSL connection.<br /><br />I ended up scrapping the 2820 and buying a Canon FAXPHONE L170 (which so far has worked great - no power surge at all).<br /><br />Here is what Brother Customer Support had to say about the issue...<br /><br />My original post to Brother Customer Support...<br /><br />When the 2820 fax machine powers up there is a tremendous power surge (either receiving a fax or making a copy), the office lights flicker and the surge knocks out my DSL service.  This problem started about a week ago.  I tried placing a surge protector on the fax then a UPS surge protector.  When the fax attempts to power up when connected to the UPS (uninterruptible power supply  - battery backup) the surge trips the breaker in the UPS and will not power up.  The fax will power up when plugged directly into the outlet but causes the office lights to flicker.<br /><br />Brother's Reply...<br /><br />Brother Customer:<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to write to us. We apologize for any inconvenience. To correct this issue please plug machine directly to wall jack only.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Facsimile E-mail Support<br /><br />Brother International Corporation, USA<br /><br />My Reply to Brother...<br /><br />Brother Support:<br /><br />Please re-read the original post.  Plugging directly into the wall outlet does not solve anything.  The Fax machine causes a huge power surge when powering up knocking out my DSL connection.<br /><br />Please provide a solution to the huge power surge issue.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Dear Brother Customer,<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to write to us.<br /><br />This is happening because the Brother's fuser unit is trying to warm up and when warming up its going to pull the amount of power needed to perform the task that it receive, and causing other devices on the same circuit to flicker or lose power and we suggest connecting the unit directly to a power outlet that's not on the same circuit as the DSL modem.

This printer has been THE BEST college investment that I have made.<br /><br />The Pros:<br /><br />Value for Money 5/5 stars.<br />-The printer itself is dirt cheap. It's cheaper than most of the inkjets that I was looking at before it (don't buy an inkjet!)<br />-Extremely economical. The cheapo included "starter cartridge" lasted me my entire freshmen year. I printed over 1200 pages with it.<br />-Replacement toner is dirt cheap! I bought the "Brother TN360 High Yield Black Toner Cartridge" for $44 (about what you'd pay for the average inkjet set of cartridges) and just swapped it last week (Over a year later).<br />-Energy Star Approved. Need I say more? (all you cheapo college kids without electric bills might not appreciate this until you start renting an apartment!)<br /><br />Reliability 5/5 stars.<br />-I've had 1 (one) jam. That's it. 1 single jam in over a year of use, and it was while I was trying to print on an envelope (see point below in Cons).<br /><br />Print Speed 5/5 stars.<br />-Relatively fast printing. For $60, this printer is more than fast enough for even my lengthiest reports. It's not a business workhorse like the HP P4014's on campus, but then again it's about $550 cheaper.<br /><br />Ease of Setup 5/5 stars.<br />-Setup takes less than 5 minutes:<br />  -Take it out of the box<br />  -Pull the safety tape off of the tray and toner.<br />  -Insert toner and paper.<br />  -Plug it in.<br />-The printer is the PERFECT SIZE. It's almost perfectly square, so it stacks well. It's not heavy. It easily fits right on my desk without getting in the way.<br /><br />Ease of Use 5/5 stars.<br />-Windows 7 found and installed it automagically (including the correct printer thumbnail).<br />-Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop found it right away.<br />-Toner Saver Mode (which is an ABSOLUTE MUST), was very simple to turn on.<br /><br />The Cons:<br /><br />Features 4/5 stars.<br />-First of all, know that I didn't dock the star because of the lack of color (that would be unfair since this is CLEARLY a monochrome printer).<br />-It doesn't print color. Big deal, 99/100 college reports and documents have 0 pages that need to be printed in color. Why waste money on expensive color ink if 50% is used on those stupid color advertisements in the page margins? I'll run to the library if I need to print 1 or 2 pages in color. Plus, for the family type, why do you need to print in color? If you're not printing out Birthday Cards or Cheesy Certificates, I'd save the money and just print in B&W.<br />-Printing on envelopes using the dedicated slot is a pain. I've tried multiple times and never had a good experience, or awesome results. This printer loves 8.5 x 11.<br /><br />Noise 4/5 stars.<br />-When in use, it's a tiny bit noisy; however, all laserjets are.<br />-At idle, this thing is silent, and power-up time out of stand-by is fantastic.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />This is THE BEST investment I've made in my college career. It's cheapy cheapy, extremely reliable, relatively fast, so-easy-to-setup-that-a-caveman-could-do-it, the perfect size, and OS friendly. Yes, the lack of color might bother some (it doesn't bother me), just ask yourself "why should I print in color?" And it's a little bit noisy (meaning that staying up till 4AM printing out sources for your research paper might irritate your roommate (if you have one)). Do either of those matter even the slightest in the grand-scheme-of-things? No. At least not in my opinion.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this printer.;;5.0;;August 17, 2010;;10;;10;;1.0

I don't print much to be honest with you, but always thought that a color printer was something everybody should have in the home.  I've owned about 4 HP multi-function printers over the years, and my last one was the worst in respect to ink.  Not only were there 6 cartridges, but even printing in Black yielded a drop in the color inks!  Due the infrequent usage of the printer, my inks would also "expire" so that I had to replace them.  All this coupled with the fact that when I did buy new ink, most of the time the cartridges (which were small in the first place), only came half full!<br /><br />OK, so you didn't come here to read about my issues with HP, although I think most people can empathize!<br /><br />So, in looking for another printer, I looked for the following:<br /><br /> - Scanner<br /> - Printer (Laser)<br /> - Networked (Wireless or Hardwired)<br /> - Reasonable Price (under $300)<br /> - Not an HP!<br /><br />What I got in the main, exceeded my expectations.  Granted I only got this today, but from unpacking to printing the first page, was an absolute breeze.  It's a lot smaller and lighter than I was expecting but quite a bit taller than my HP all-in-one.<br /><br />I have multiple Windows machines (no Mac or Linux to test with right now) on my network, and each one picked up the printer during driver install first time.  I downloaded the drivers directly from Brother so I had the latest ones, and I also ensured that after everything was running, I updated the firmware of the printer too.  All this was done with ease.<br /><br />The print quality is as you would expect from a laser printer, very clean and sharp.  I especially like the duplex feature which allows printing on both sides.  I even tried the multiple pages on one (4 to 1 in this instance with duplex), and it downsized the PDF file whilst keeping it still pretty readable.  The warm up from sleep to print was pretty quick.  I would say less than 10 seconds.<br /><br />The build quality is pretty good.  It's not as solid as an Enterprise type laser printer, but what do you expect for $179!?  I was a little worried about the scan cover only lifting 45 degrees (as mentioned in the first review), but it lifts way more than that (probably about 65 degrees), plus it has a vertical lift on the hinges so you can scan thick books etc. which is nice.  I do agree with the other review, the spring loaded lid is brutal, so you need to be careful when lifting the lid, otherwise you could damage the hinges.<br /><br />However, with that said, the scanning feature is not quite as nice as the HP one.  I need to play with it a bit more, but there doesn't appear to be a preview feature, and if you scan multiple pictures it doesn't allow you create multiple files (because there is no preview feature).<br /><br />All-in-all though, with the fact that you get a starter cartridge that will last quite a while (with no expiry!), this printer is an absolute bargain for $170.  Given I would have had to replace my HP cartridges anyway, which would have been $70, you can understand why this is, in the long run, a very cost effective printer.  With high yield toner cartridges that print about 2500 pages for $50, I can't see me ever going back to an Inkjet.<br /><br />In conclusion, don't be put off by the Brother brand and their relative obscurity compared to HP, they've been around for a long time.<br /><br />I'm dinging the product 1 star because of the lack of preview and multi-image in the scanning software, and the spring loaded lid.  I'm hoping there is an alternative/remedy to this.  But for that, it would be five stars.<br /><br />Pros<br /> - Great printer, especially with duplex, and n to 1 printing<br /> - Fast print speed and nice quality<br /> - Scan and copy multiple documents using the auto feeder<br /> - Long lasting, non expiring toner cartridge (700 pages from the free one!)<br /> - Enclosed paper tray with pretty good capacity (250 sheets)<br /> - No large output tray sitting on the side of printer, output is almost enclosed in the middle of the printer<br /> - Not an HP! :)<br /><br />Cons<br /> - Scanner software doesn't have preview or the ability produce multiple images at once (that I can tell)<br /> - Brutal spring loaded scan cover<br /> - Not color (but wasn't a requirement for me anyway)<br /> - No wireless (again not a big deal, but might be for some)<br /><br />UPDATE (08/07/2011):  I've found the preview feature!  As I'm a bit of a computer geek, I generally switch software to "Advanced Mode" to gain more control over it.  It seems this mode doesn't show you previews which is a bit odd.  However, by selecting "Home Mode", the preview is there.  Granted the multi-image scan is still not there, but it's still an improvement.  FYI, the mode can be found under Configuration > Mode Select.<br /><br />UPDATE (04/04/2012):  So, just to let people know that I've had the printer for about 7 months, and just today, after printing 311 pages with the STARTER toner cartridge (with Toner Save OFF) that ships free with the unit, I got my first warning that the toner was low.  Almost certainly if I had still had my HP printer, I would have gone through at least 2 or 3 of the colors, and the other ones would have probably expired and needed replacing, costing me about $10+ per cartridge.  I am still incredibly happy with the print quality and the print options.  It's still lacking the killer option of multiple separate photo scans in a single pass, but frankly I've not had a lot of photos to scan in recent months, so do not miss it currently!  Lastly, with the price drop to $129 (which it had been down to recently), it's even more of a bargain than it was when I bought it.;;4.0;;July 15, 2011;;104;;105;;0.990476

It even comes with a bag that you can use to carry it with you--this printer can be used either with a USB connection to a computer or as a wireless printer. (It comes with a USB cable.) As far as scanning and copying go, these functions are also rather easy to do; the instructions make the first time you copy a snap!<br /><br />For printing, get HP 61 black and white cartridges and HP 61 Tri-color cartridges. If you can catch a sale on these, stock up!<br /><br />One reviewer notes that it doesn't have a fax feature but I agree with them when they also say that you can just scan a copy of a document into your computer and send that as an attachment to any email.<br /><br />Overall, I really can't think of anything negative to say about this printer.

I received it yesterday and so far so good.<br /><br />Wireless setup requires connection with a USB cable. The wireless on the printer picks up twice as many neighboring access points as my Thinkpad, so it's pretty sensitive. It's a little noisy when printing or calibrating and not particularly speedy. I'm sharing it for home use with my wife - our "small workgroup". The print quality is excellent and what little graphics I've done look good. The starter cartridges say they're good for "> 600 pages", but the predicted page count will self-adjust depending on your usage patterns.<br /><br />Four replacement toner cartridges cost more than the printer does, but even if you throw it away after the starter toner runs out, it still works out to about 40 cents per page, which is in the ballpark for supplies for some other color printers. Since we use color infrequently (hence the dried up inkjets), I'm expecting the starter color cartridges to last a good long time. I already bought a replacement black toner cartridge for $60 for 2000 pages, 3 cents a page, again in the ballpark for cheap B&W laser printers.<br /><br />Unlike some manual feed trays, this one sucks in the paper a few inches when you insert it - no more standing there holding it wondering if the printer will pick it up.<br /><br />Addendum - 12/16/2010 - the Kingston KTH-LJ2015/256 256MB memory module works in this printer - popularly priced here at Amazon.<br /><br />Update - 11/26/2011 - Here I am a year later and still happy. One oddity to note with my printer: I print greeting cards on it and initially used the manual feed for the card stock. After a while, the manual feed wouldn't feed card stock reliably, which is a real pain when trying to print double sided on expensive paper. It would "suck in", but then just lays on the manual feed tray and never gets pulled into the print engine.<br /><br />I finally gave up on the manual feed and just put the card stock in the "auto" paper tray, which to my surprise worked perfectly!<br /><br />The printer comes with starter cartridges good for about 1/3 the usage of the retail cartridges.<br /><br />The retail price for four replacement toner cartridges is around $280. If you keep an eye out HP occasionally runs 20% off toner sales which helps.;;5.0;;December 2, 2010;;176;;177;;0.99435

A "maintenance cycle" seems to slowly drain ink whether I am printing or not.<br />- Local Office Max store doesn't refill Canon ink cartridges, so my ink costs are higher than HP ink.<br />- Sometimes when I send a document to the printer, the printer will go into a maintenance cycle that takes 1-2 minutes, after which it finally prints the document.  Never had those delays with HP 960.<br />- Overall, printer is OK, but I'd probably buy an HP next time.<br /><br />Update 6/21/2011:<br /><br />After 6 months use...<br />This printer still does a nice job of printing on plain paper, but:<br />- it is still an ink-pig.  It empties a never-used cartridge in 4 months.  Count on it.<br />- it still smears the ink when printing envelopes.  God help you if you try to load more than one envelope at a time.<br />- it still goes into la-la land every so often and keeps you waiting 2-3 minutes before you can do anything.<br /><br />I could have bought an HP 6500 AND THE INK FOR IT for the amount I've spent on Canon ink in 6 months.  Don't think this Canon will see next Christmas.<br /><br />Update 12/2/2011<br /><br />The envelope printing problem turned out to be a batch of faulty envelopes.  Several new boxes of envelopes all work well.<br /><br />I never print color, but this printer empties 4 $15 color ink cartridges every 3-4 months.  Where does the ink go?  To make things worse, the software tells you those cartridges are empty almost a month before they really are.  If you want to print photographs, this is a good choice.  If you want to print black & white, I see two cost-effective choices: let the color cartridges run dry and probably ruin the color printing function of the printer or buy a different printer for B&W.;;3.0;;April 22, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

We A-B'ed the same file--one with this printer and one with a lab, and the lab's print's were slightly better, in turn of color saturation and contrast. The quality of the prints on this machine will depend on your photo processing program (i.e., Photoshop)settings.  Do not try to use the printer's software increase colors or contrast, the drivers suck and just aren't meant for doing this like a professional Photoshop type program.  So simply disable the printer's settings and do everything in Photoshop.  This took me the better part of a week to figure this out, going through the various settings.  Another tip I can offer you is to not use the front tray--load everything from the rear, as it is twice as fast.  I'm not even sure why they have two inputs.  The unit does not come with a USB cord, so get a nice long one, one with a square end on one end, the thin USB rectangle end on the other.  That's about a $10 problem.  Use only Canon paper, and buy the best you can, the Platinum Professional.  Yeah, its twice as expensive, but the prints will blow you away.;;4.0;;January 21, 2011;;19;;19;;1.0

That said, the Samsung customer service system is ...ah... primitive.  As is the cost structure for feeding the thing after purchase. Toner replacement costs and a new image drum exceed the cost of a new one, by about 170%, yet are only acout 160% more images per set. The carts that come in it are good for about 700 images (color). New ones are good for 1000, they say. A full set of CMYK carts is about $220, and a new drum is around $50, if you need it (at about 10000 pix). But a whole new printer is just $150-ish. The math is all &$@%¥£!!<br /><br />If the toner carts were reload able for $30 each, the thing would make more sense. Third party toner powder replacement? Messy and most likely lower performance. Do the google.<br /><br />When I had a problem, I used the Samsung site's customer service system. No reply AT ALL. Nothing. Confirmation that they received it was on the transmission page, but no reply.<br /><br />Avoid super thick paper. Use premium heavy laser paper, please. Images can be very nice--near ink jet to most viewers. Colors are only a tad lower in vibrance than photo ink jet. It will take a great deal of testing to get used to how it portrays things. Dark images EAT toner quicker. Cost per sheet is in the $0.25 range initially. that's toner + paper computed against bargain initial cost.<br />You might shave a few cents off that with replacement carts, but not much.<br /><br />Bottom line: it will be great while it lasts.<br /><br />Note. Seller was fine. Samsung gets the low star rating.;;4.0;;June 3, 2011;;70;;71;;0.985915

We came from the HP Color Laser Jet CP3505n which was the same price. The HP I think prints slightly faster & the quality is slightly better, but it only does printing (and single page at that). This brother on the other hand has a slew of awesome options that we needed & prints more than fine. We needed a scanner that could scan to network folders & ftp locations. This printer works awesome for that. It actually replaced a $150 scanner we had because it's so easy w/ the brother. The duplexing features have come in handy plenty of times too. Fax machine is pretty standard, no issues there. For the 1st month or 2, this printer seemed like baby jesus in my eyes, it could do no wrong.. until ....<br />One day I went to change out the black toner, and ran into a big problem. When I replaced the black toner, it was not recognizing that the toner had been changed & was now full. It would just obnoxiously blink "REPLACE TONER" & do nothing else. I actually bought 2 of these brothers & the other brother had the exact same issue. So I scour forums looking how to bypass the sensors or reset the toner manually. After trying every taping of the sensor trick I could find & looking for 2 days I found a way to manually reset the Toner low or Replace toner notifications (listed below).<br />Once I figured this out, everything else was smooth sailing, I just wish Brother didn't make resetting the toner life so annoyingly difficult. It's all good now though. I'd recommend this printer w/ the code below.<br /><br />************************************************************************************<br />Brother MFC-9560 toner cartridge Low Toner or Replace Toner Override<br />************************************************************************************<br />1.

I contacted HP tech for help, but alas, after hours of trying this and that (you know the drill) it was determined that I needed to return my printer to Best Buy, a mere five miles from my house.  I still had a week for a simple exchange...but NOOOOO, the man (from another country, probably India) insisted that they didn't want me to go through the trouble!  Please let us send you a replacement via ups.  I thought that was silly but he insisted.  I told him that I could exchange this printer in less than an hour, but I caved and allowed him to send it to me<br /><br />I did have another printer I could use in the meantime (my ancient Canon...it's still ticking after seven years...) so it was no huge deal.<br /><br />About one week later, UPS drops an HP box off on my porch.<br /><br />The first thing that I notice is that it has a large sticker on it that says, "REFURBISHED IN MEXICO"<br /><br />My thoughts were "WHAT THE ****!"  REFURBISHED?<br /><br />I refused the package (never opened it) and UPS picked it up a few days later.<br /><br />I contacted HP and spoke to a rep who kept insisting that it was a good as new. (scripting, scripting, AAARGH!)  I DIDN'T WANT as GOOD as NEW!  I wanted NEW since that was what I had!!  I was not happy and went in circles with them, reminding them that it was over the 30 days now in which I could have EASILY exchanged my HP at Best Buy. I was hugely insulted and felt very deceived.<br /><br />I went to BB and explained the situation, giving them a copy of my online chat text with the rep.  They were very cool about it and exchanged my printer for me, as a matter of fact I upgraded to an HP5650.  In hindsight, I should have gone with another manufacturer altogether.<br /><br />I contacted HP again and spoke to some higher up rep about this situation...and mind you, I don't swear at people and was polite but assertive with my complaint to this woman...she was witch from the get-go...I told her that I thought the service was deceptive and I had to spend an awful lot of time on the phone, calling them, UPS, calling them again, and exchanging my unit because of what they had sent me.  I could have simply exchanged the unit on the first day and it would have been done.<br /><br />She said, "Well, what do you WANT from us?"  very very curtly,<br /><br />All I wanted was to be heard, have them admit their error and to have the two new ink cartridges that I was told to open(by their rep) for testing in my printer replaced.  She finally agreed.<br /><br />They sent me only one of the cartridges. Losers.<br /><br />So, here I am with my HP5650, which has a history of being temperamental, getting hung up (turn it off, wait an hour, try again) but printed text and graphics very well otherwise.<br /><br />Yesterday evening the carriage froze up.  I could barely get the ink cartriges out, obviously, things are messed up.  I can't get the ink cartridges back in because the whole set-up in the carriage area is stuck.  I've got two expensive ink cartridges left and this thing is now a piece of garbage.  We even resorted to pounding on it.

I originally bought a 7 and had to return it and got this one instead.  Just as bad.<br /><br />The initial set up is relatively easy except that you will get all sorts of irritating "error" messages such as the printer not recognizing the ink cartridges that come in the printer box; you will have difficulty with the print head; you will get paper jam messages, both real and phantom; the machine is incredibly noisy and shakes; it takes seemingly forever to get itself warmed up and will make lots of noise in the process.<br /><br />The real fun starts with the wireless connectivity.  It does not work.  It does not work. It does not work.  You will spend hours on the phone with the boys from Mumbai and have them tell you useful things such as , "make sure you printer is plugged in and turned on."  You will, after reinstalling the software several times, turning the machine on and off several more, finally get it to connect.  That will last about one or two print jobs, and then it is gone again.  If you keep calling and emailing, the boys from Mumbai will eventually begin to cough up some truths about the machine.  It turns out it has "issues" with iMAC.  Ok, I switched to a PC and it still didn't work.  It has "reported issues" with DELL and HP, too!  Then it has issues with some of the most popular wifi routers around:  NETGEAR and LINKSYS.  I finally gave up on wireless and went to USB cable.  Worked for about two print jobs then more fun:  "Printer is off-line."  That was NEVER fixed.  I spent more time with the service reps from Mumbai and they couldn't figure out why the USB connection would not work.  They ended up referring me to their website to see if maybe some customer had written something helpful in a discussion forum!!  I packed the thing up and returned it.  The Best Buy Geek Squad guy told me the Kodak "printers have a lot of issues.  We have lots of returns."  Really?  I never would have guessed.<br /><br />Avoid this machine and ignore the five star reviews, some of which seem to have been written by people flacking for Kodak products.

Though I like the quality of the printing, including the quality of pictures printed on this unit, paper handling is a joke, and it's clearly designed for printing a page or two once or twice a week.<br /><br />For one thing, the out tray is a joke.  The printer shoots paper out onto a tiny ledge which is only about 6 or 7 inches long when fully extended.  2 times out of 3 the paper will either fly past the plastic ledge and end up on the floor or droop over the edge until a gust of air from a person walking by blows the sheet into the floor.  Good luck collating that unnumbered 15-page PDF!<br /><br />There is no removable inbound paper tray.  The inbound tray does not keep the paper away from dust and debris.  Rather, this printer is designed such that when you need it, you open the cover, put in the paper you need, and when you're done, you remove the paper and close it up.<br /><br />The memory card reader can be accessed from another computer connected via USB.  Supposedly it can also be used via a network connection, but there is no documentation on how to make that work.  The printer is available via web-browser to make configuration changes but AFAICS you can't access the picture card that way either.<br /><br />This is my third replacement under the extended warranty.

I chose 3 stars for "green-ness" since I'm not able to say one way or the other yet.  Overall, VERY satisfied with this printer.

The standard 3000-page TN-620 is currently about $57 here on Amazon, while the oversized 8000-page TN-650 is $91. That's way above the price of similar HP toner cartridges. The "toner save" setting (or whatever it's called) produces nice results, at least for text... I wonder how much toner it actually saves?<br /><br />The paper curl is mildly annoying on single-sided print and quite prominent on double-sided. Take a printed page and set it on the table, and the top and bottom edges are sticking up. Sticking WAY up for a double-sided print. That paper must really get run around some tight rollers. On the paper that I'm using, the curl does relax fairly quickly.<br /><br />I didn't see where it said anything on the packaging, but setting it up for wireless setup will probably require initially setting the printer up wired. Once you've got the printer configured, you can lose the cord. I imagine that most of us wireless users still have at least one network cable lying around, but it'd be nice if you had some warning.<br /><br />The printer drivers installed fine on a 64-bit Vista system, an XP tower, and an XP netbook (the latter required copying the installation CD onto a thumb drive). I'd configured the printer with a static IP address, and there was no problem at all getting all three systems talking to the printer. Considering the amount of grief that I usually get from drivers and configuration (especially on Vista-64), I was astounded. Everything went like it was supposed to.<br /><br />When you go to actually print a document, the "properties" panels aren't as well organized as I'd like but they're not really bad.<br /><br />As has become standard practice these days, there is no paper manual except for a quick-start. The manual is on the CD. Someday I'll have to look at it and see what all the buttons and features are for.<br /><br />In summary, there are certainly better printers to be had, but it'd be pretty hard to find a better one at this price.;;5.0;;July 13, 2009;;20;;20;;1.0

But now, after one-and-a-half years of utterly frustrating ownership, I am finally compelled to pan this machine publicly. And I don't typically write product reviews, so believe me this is a doozy.<br /><br />You see, as it all too often does, my machine has jammed for the second time in an hour this afternoon on a tiny (10-page) print job, and so I am left with time on my hands to hold forth.  A quite familiar error message is now instructing me to "leave the machine for 10 minutes to cool down."  And so I wait, for about the umpteenth agonizing time.<br /><br />Well people, the machine might eventually cool down, but I cannot.<br /><br />PROs:<br />1.  Double-sided printing capacity. Emphasis on "capacity."  It doesn't reliably do this because of terrible paper jams.  More on this below.<br /><br />2.  Wireless networking.<br /><br />3.  Color printing.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1.  Constant printer jams when printing duplex.  This happens almost daily. And it's unrelenting.  When it jams once, it will jam repeatedly after that even after I wait far more than the recommended 10 minutes.  I've tried different printer papers. I've tried powering down.  Nothing helps when this baby gets on a paper jamming jag.<br /><br />2.  Useless with envelopes. It flattens, crinkles and - worst of all - SEALS them.  So they've got to be pried open immediately after printing, which is a hassle. And they look terrible and totally unprofessional.<br /><br />3.  Causes a power surge every time it wakes up from power save mode. Seriously.  It triggers my battery backup every time, with a disturbing audible response. Not good.<br /><br />4.  Poor print quality  - over time, black spots and streaks have begun showing on black and white printouts, but I still have almost 40% life left on the drum according to the unit.<br /><br />5.  Cumbersome design feature  - the printer's default is "FAX." So, if you want to copy or scan you've got to press "copy" or "scan" buttons first.  Not a big deal in the scheme of things, but very annoying over time. Especially if you're doing repeated copy or scan jobs.  Come on, Brother - who does more faxing than copying or scanning these days?<br /><br />My printer gets only light business use (one user, and I'm mostly electronic not paper these days).  There's no reason it shouldn't be performing much better.<br /><br />Good news - my "wait ten minutes" message has expired.  But guess what? It is resuming the print job and has just jammed again . . .;;1.0;;July 18, 2012;;7;;7;;1.0

I thought I was buying a brand new printer, but I was sent a refurbished one with the seller not even bothering to ship it out in a box. They just slap on the shipping label onto the retail packaging and hope for the best I guess. Shipping was quick, and the refurbished printer (along with the recertified ink), works fine, albeit there's a broken piece of plastic on the back. However, I can still justify this purchase due to their cheap price (bought it under $60 with shipping) and my urgent need for a printer for school. I think its deceitful of the seller not to mention that they send out refurbished goods, but for the price, as long it prints my schoolwork, I'm good.<br /><br />On to the review for the printer: Printer does a decent job for the price. Very light weight and simple design, easy to use. Has wireless connection, which I needed to set up with the included disk, but no trouble connecting the printer to my laptop. Includes USB cable in case you don't have wireless. Printer speed is a little slower than what I'm used to, but not slow enough that it is inconvenient. I think the paper tray hold up to 25 sheets or something, but since I'm only printing stuff for school this factor is not important. Printing quality is fantastic for such a cheap printer. Not sure how much ink is used per page but I read in other reviews that the ink cartridges don't last very long. I'll update with my experiences once I use the printer a bit more. Definitely a bargain if all you need to do is some light printing.;;3.0;;October 12, 2011;;37;;38;;0.973684

This was a good bargain even compared to online shopping prices.  I know that if you are patient, and you perform a bit of due diligence, you can get this printer "new, never opened, and unrefurbished" on eBay for around $100-120 (I know this because I bought a secnod one as a Christmas present for $105 on eBay). Note however, it does not come with a 2.0 cable - so you will have to buy one to connect it to your computer ($25 in the retail stores and $5-7 on eBay).  I am one of those shoppers that "does his homework" before making purchases.  I was buying this to replace my miserable Brother HL-1440.  I say miserable despite its generally good ratings because the poor LONG-TERM value of this printer clearly outweighed the initial features.  What I mean by this is that the Brother requires not only the replacement of a toner cartridge at, what $60 per shot?  But also, an EXPENSIVE DRUM every 4-5 toner cartridges.  The drum alone cost about $130!!  You might as well buy a new laser printer - which I DID.  Printer manufactureres are like drug dealers in a way- they sell the printer itself for cheap to lure you in...the hit you hard when it comes to the cartridges (and/or drum).<br /><br />The beauty of the HP-1020 is that it is very inexpensive, efficient, blazing fast (as advertised - 353% faster) from the time you click "print" to when the printer actually spits our your document (about 4-5 seconds) even when the printer is not "warm."  Also, THIS PRINTER DOES NOT REQUIRE A DRUM REPLACEMENT.  The cartridges cost $70 if you pay full price, but I found new, original HP nonrefurbished cartridges for $55 (including the shipping cost) - never buy them in a store, always buy online from a reputable retailer like "New Egg".<br /><br />Anyway, this prints very clean documents, and set-up could not be easier, even for a non-techie.  I actually set this printer up on my home network so my wife could print from her (wireless internet connection) laptop, directly to the HP-1020 which I connected to my desktop computer.  It is pretty cool.<br /><br />FREE ADVICE: Don't listen to the untrained computer store high schoolers help who tell you (or me) that you need a network enabled printer to set up a network printer whereby you can share the printer with other computers or laptops on your network - you DON'T.  Just search online for directions on how to set it up (and make sure your firewalls are DISABLED on all computers to add the new printer - you will know what I'm talking about once you try to set it up).<br /><br />As for the specs of the HP-1020, don't let the 600x600 dpi mislead you.  It prints equally as well if not better than as those "1200 x 1200" dpi printers - you will NOT be able to see a difference.  If you can think you can, set up an appoinment with your optomotrist.  In other words, why waste away your hard-earned $$$, which can be as much as an extra $50-100, just for useless specs that do not represent the true and actual print quality of documents you will receive?  Put that $$$ towards a back-up toner cartridge.  Besides, Hewlett-Packard utilizes some sort of "dpi enhancement" on the HL-1020 to maximize its 600x600 dpi to give you a 1200x1200 type print quality.<br /><br />There was a newer model, i.e., HP-1022 with "better" dpi specs and more memory (8mb versus 2mb on the HP-1020).  Again, don't let this mislead you into paying more than you have to.  The memory supplied in the HP-1020 is PLENTY.  Trust me, I am one of those guys that always wants the "best AND MOST features" on electronics - so if I thought it was necessary, I would have purchased the HP-1022.<br /><br />The funny thing is, every time I would print on my old Brother HL-1440, my computer would ALWAYS give me an irritiating "not enough memory"-type pop-up everytime I printed, despite the fact I had over 24 MB of memory in the printer itself!  NOT ANYMORE!  This HL-1020 printer works flawlessly with 2 mb of memory.  Also, if you are thinking about buying the HP-1022, the ratings I've seen online as not nearly as good as the HP-1020.  In fact, the HP-1020 has received nearly perfect 5-star ratings from about 12-15 reviewers I've seen on the internet from different review websites. Plus, the HL-1022 costs about $70 more! For what?<br /><br />In sum, I would HIGHLY recommend the HL-1020 printer for home or even small business use.  It's truly a value, and you will not go broke once you get through the first toner cartridge.  Thus, TWO thumbs up and FIVE stars.  Oh by the way, I did look at other brands, HP seemed to be favored over others in reliability, quality, etc.<br /><br />I hope this helps your shopping decision.;;5.0;;November 12, 2005;;198;;209;;0.947368

I purchased this for two reasons: First, I wanted a good multifunction printer that could also print excellent photos. Second, I wanted the print speeds that this printer advertises.<br /><br />I do not know how they arrive at their speed specs, but here are my test results:<br />Although black text printing is lightning fast, color printing on high quality settings is not much faster than my 5 yr old epson Stylus. A 4x6 borderless photo printed in 'best photo' quality using glossy photo paper took 2 minutes, 20 seconds!!! I was floored at how long it took. So then I decided to do some direct comparisons with my old Epson Stylus Photo (R320).<br />I chose to print color flyers that I needed to print anyway. They are full color (including backgrounds), and some photo work. I used the regular Photo Quality, on 8 1/2 x 11 premium presentation paper. One flyer took 1 minute 20 seconds on the Workforce. The same flyer my old Epson printer (a Stylus R320) took 2 minutes 23 seconds, on the same setting, but it produced a much better looking flyer. Then I tried using the 'text & image' setting, both printers. It only took 40 seconds on the Workforce and 47 seconds on the old Stylus. The interesting thing was that on the stylus, I could get the same quality on 'text & image' setting as I got on the Workforce 'photo' setting. So basically, when you compare actual printout quality, the Workforce takes 1 min 20 sec compared to the old printer's 47 seconds, because I have to step up the quality setting to get the same results with the Workforce. To be fair, I do hold the flyers side by side when comparing quality. It's obvious in that situation, but someone only seeing the lesser quality flyer would probably not know the difference. But here's an interesting thing... Printing a photo in regular text setting (not text & Image) the quality is better on the Workforce. It did not degrade going from 'text & image' to just 'text'. On my old printer it does degrade.<br /><br />So this brings me to the Quality issue. Yes, I was pleasantly surprised at the photo quality, given that this is not your typical photo printer. Colors are very slightly less saturated than with my old printer. But you have to hold the comparisons literally right next to each other to tell the difference. This difference could easily be compensated for in Photoshop. Also, you pretty much have to use the highest setting (best photo) to get really good quality, and when you do that the speeds are definitely not there. Because of the speed issue alone, I was tempted to go three stars instead of four, but since I was undecided I 'rounded up'.<br /><br />For the rest of the issues, I am completely satisfied. Although I am a network idiot, I was able to set this up wirelessly no problem. I love the two paper trays, since I do print a lot of photos. The only jam I experienced so far was when I printed on photo paper with regular paper under it. the photo paper came thru first, part of the picture was printed on it, then the rest of the picture was printed on the regular paper that came right behind. I haven't tried multiple copies with photo paper but that'll be my next test. I have yet to test other features, but I was pleased to see the OCR program being installed during setup. I guess I didn't realize it had that. I usually don't install a lot of the extra software that comes with printers, as I prefer to use Photoshop for everything, from scanning, to photo manipulation. But this time I did install the extra software and so far am impressed with the Easy Photo Print. Very straight forward and easy to use. Just click on the pictures you want to print (using ctrl key to choose more than one) and then you are taken to a very simple & user friendly photo fixer. Being anal about my pics, I'll still use mostly Photoshop, but I was impressed nonetheless.<br /><br />That's about it for now. Bottom line, I'll keep it and it will serve me well. But I am definitely disappointed in the speed, and the fact that you really need the highest quality print settings to get good photos. But at least you CAN get good photos, and that was one of my initial concerns.<br /><br />4/6/11: Ok, for the first time I printed multiple copies on 48 lb. trifold brochure paper. So far I've run 50 through and No JAMS!!!! Yay!;;4.0;;March 18, 2011;;8;;8;;1.0

I started with a list of Consumer Reports recommended models for home office use & I looked up the Amazon reviews on each of those models. I hesitated making any purchase, b/c :<br /><br />* there wasn't a single, clearly "best" model of the ones I considered.<br />* specifically about the HP 8600, other reviewers reported that the printer software caused problems for them.<br /><br />Despite my concerns, the HP 8600 seemed to be pretty popular, so I held my breath & bought it. Unfortunately, my experience with the 8600 has been frustrating. Two specific recurring problems have made me regret this purchase:<br /><br />1) Network printing stops working after the printer has been idle for a few days. Within Windows 7, the HP Printer application shows the printer is on-line & ready, but when I try to print a test page or a document, an error message appears : "Unable to communicate with printer". Other users have reported this problem on the HP forums, but there hasn't been a solution posted. The only temporary fix appears to be to uninstall & reinstall the driver.<br /><br />2) The HP Windows driver runs continuously, causing system slowdown & annoying mouse cursor change. This is a tricky problem to "prove", b/c Windows Task Manager doesn't show the driver process taking significant CPU time. However, it's clear that after installing the driver from the HP disk, the Windows cursor will constantly change from normal to "busy" (spinning wheel appears next to pointer) & back to normal, throughout the day! Opening files / starting programs takes longer when the busy cursor is displayed. Uninstalling the driver solves the problem : no more "busy" cursor.<br /><br />It's disgraceful that HP software engineers & quality-control managers either didn't catch these two issues or didn't care that their drivers are so badly behaved.. Makes me sad to see a once-great company fall so low in product quality.<br /><br />I would not recommend buying this printer unless / until you see that these software problems have been fixed.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/23/2011 : Over the weekend, I spent an hour or so trying to get HP's "Basic Device Software" (a download option from HP) to work. Couldn't get the test page to print. I downloaded & ran the "HP Print Diagnostic Utility" : it says the printer is "visible from computer" & connected via "Network" (i.e. wired network). However, when I clicked "Next", the message changed to "The printer is not connected"..! So which is it, connected or not connected..?? No wonder the printer driver doesn't work! Anyway, after this message, no further options or instructions are given.<br /><br />I also found a new thread ("HP 8600 goes to sleep, disappears from network") on HP's forum by another user of this same printer, who's continuing to get the same problem described in #1 above. An HP engineer responded with a number of steps to follow, & the user states s/he followed all the steps, to no avail.<br /><br />Reading this thread was completely discouraging to me. I just don't have unlimited time to work with HP support people to try to figure out why the printer stops working correctly. It's really HP's problem, not mine. I submitted a request this morning to Amazon to return the HP 8600 & called the 3rd party seller (Beach Trading Co) to make sure they would approve my return, given all the work I put in to try to get the product to work for me. The rep approved my RMA & I'm sending it back.<br /><br />I got a recommendation to look at Epson printers. The Epson WorkForce 845 has very positive reviews on Amazon, & is just a bit more expensive than the HP 8600. I ordered the Epson model today & will report my experiences on Amazon's Epson 845 page in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />FINAL UPDATE 5/25/2012 : I've had the Epson WorkForce 845 for several weeks now & have been very satisfied. I recommend that you consider the Epson over the HP.;;2.0;;April 18, 2012;;12;;12;;1.0

I have a small real estate law practice, but I do go through a lot of printing and copying, and this machine has been reliable.  I use it with my laptop and wifi.  I bought the extra tray for legal size paper, which was pretty easy to install (although you have to lift up the whole printer and set it down just right on top of the 2nd tray, kind of a delicate and tricky operation) and it reliably chooses the right size paper automatically.<br /><br />The good: it has been reliable.  I've had no major jams or breakdowns in a year and a half of use.  I can print 100 pages or more at a time, several times a month.  It is my only printer/copier/fax/scanner, and when I've got clients waiting on me to print/copy things, it is good to know I can rely on it.<br /><br />The mediocre: maybe this is just how my IT guy set it up, but it's not great for scanning.  It scans each page as a separate image doc, so I really can't use it for scanning docs more than a few pages.  Some people also can't open the image attachment.  I also can't get it to scan legal size, so I have to copy and reduce to letter size before scanning.  Maybe it scans legal just fine and I haven't fully read the instructions, but at least scanning legal size is not "user friendly", because I haven't been able to do it yet.  I stress again though that it's possible this is a problem with my setup or just "user error."<br /><br />The bad: It will not duplex copy on legal size.  What the heck?  If I have front and back on legal size, I have to run the front, flip the whole doc over and run the back, and then sort through and put the copy pages together.  Also, I really have to "babysit" the machine when printing or copying a large volume.  In both the originals receiving tray on top, and the copy receiving tray underneath, even when you flip out the extra "tongues", which are meant to keep papers in place, it still sometimes begins to push documents out onto the floor.  Even worse, I have had copies get pushed out onto the bypass tray and actually get sucked back into the bypass intake, causing it to print on top of the copy and then jam.  Not cool.  I've come in to work one morning after someone sent me a large fax, and found various pages of the fax scattered all over the floor.<br /><br />Needless to say this is all a big pain.  For large volume printing and copying, you have to keep watch over it, and when it starts to push pages out, you kind of have to shove them back in so they don't get out of order, fall onto the floor, or get sucked into the bypass tray.<br /><br />However, I've worked in other firms with the really fancy, high volume printers, and they have plenty of their own issues with jamming, etc.  Quite the contrary, with this machine repair and toner replacement have been very easy.  I've had virtually no "mysterious" jamming or repair issues like the big expensive machines have all the time.  when there is a jam or toner needs replacing, the machine is pretty simple, so unjamming and toner replacement have been very easy.<br /><br />So, bottom line, for the price I would recommend this printer.  It's reliable and a good value.<br /><br />I would also definitely recommend the high volume toner.  I've been getting it on amazon, which is a lot cheaper than buying it in the office supply stores.;;3.0;;December 5, 2010;;134;;142;;0.943662

Even though it has a sleep mode, its high-frequency noise before it sleeps will be one of your loudest computer devices in the house. You can set the sleep mode to one minute, but this was the longest one minute I've had to endure. The printer is in a non-computer room and just use the On/Off switch to turn it off if it becomes too much of a bother. This isn't particularly inconvenient, since we have inkjet scanner/copiers near most of the computers for regular small-print use, but I hope this won't shorten the device's life. The laser jet is only used as "batch job" printer for all the computers we have around the house, so its wireless and auto-duplex features are a must. Compared to other budget laser printers with these features, the toner cartridge costs are less expensive. I wished I had more time to wait for a *quiet* laser printer on sale, but compared to inkjet refills, this was a good enough choice. As for installation, we have several Win XP and Windows 7 computers. I downloaded the updated drivers and software from the Brother site (updated 12/10/10 as of this review), and didn't have any problems.<br /><br />UPDATE: Five months later, the drum accumulated a "blotch" of toner. This is outside of the warranty period, and a third-party replacement costs about half the price of the original printer. A Brother drum costs the SAME price as the original. You can clean a laser drum with alcohol or acetone, but no guarantees.;;2.0;;March 27, 2011;;8;;9;;0.888889

I took a chance and got alternative cartridges from Amazon -cheap- and they worked. My printer was back to life. I ran off about 70 81/2 x11s 50 5x7s 100 4x5 card stock, and then one day streaking began again. I put in a whole new set of 5 cartridges, color streaked. Registered as full but streaked in color. Cleaned it, deep cleaned it. to no avail. Plucked out the printer head (a new one was $100.00) and cleaned it. and again. Still color prints streaked.<br />Finally I bought the Canon IP 2702 on Amazon. Reviews were good. I Figured it'll cost me $40 to see. Smaller printer. Set up swift and finally color prints of my photos. Feeling calmer. Very very nice. But some photos appeared to lack the depth and fine detail of the previous printer. I kept a record. Only 25 81/2x11 color prints. I had ordered a color cartridge (another $20) for backup. Checking for available alternative cartridges on Amazon and elsewhere, the handwriting was on the wall.<br /> Checking Epson, Hewlitt, And Canon Photo printers I settled on the Canon Pixma 4920. I liked some of the software features, print quality reviews and alternative inks were available, I think. Finally at a late night moment i hit the buy button. Amazon prime shipping has been a pleasure and it was again for this item. Set up requires focus but it was quick and smooth until I got to the insert CD and install. THERE WAS NO MAC INSTALL ICON! Puzzling and repeating. No install. SO. Here's a tip. I went to the Canon website and downloaded the drivers, online manual, and software, Adding an hour and 1/2 to set up time. But it all worked. Guess what. Canon knew that the CD install might be defective, recommended a way to see if it was the disk or your computer and if it was the disk to call them to replace. They did not advise downloading from their website ???? (from manual) I am very happy with this printer so far. High high quality photos. Detail and gradation that says Yes! I am having the winter pleasure of printing high quality photos again, and I have already used Canons software to print calendar cards to give out and mail out. Work and productivity is back. At the moment I highly recommend this printer. And with the 2702 as back up ...... Oh one more thing about buying printers at Amazon. They provide a link to all of the inks that will work with your printer. I find that very useful.;;5.0;;February 25, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

My old HP All-in-One died the same day I ordered it so I was fortunate to find this one on sale. I always have some trepidation about installing peripherals but this went so smoothly that I was happily surprised. I followed the quick set-up instructions and had no troubles, no error messages, no problems at all. Even the wireless set up was a breeze. I was up and running in abut 10 minutes. I then installed the Epson software that came with the unit. This is where I usually run into problems. But all the software installed without a problem, all the drivers, utility software and a program called Abbyy FineReader which I am not familiar with and have not yet used.<br /><br />Loading paper and installing the ink cartridges are simple tasks. The unit is prints very fast compared to previous printers I have owned and the text and graphics are amazingly clear and precise. This unit uses four separate ink cartridges; black, yellow, cyan and blue. I assume that this printer has the printhead built into the machine instead of on the cartridge but I may be wrong about that. I have researched this and can't find a definitive answer. In any event it works great. Very professional looking, dark black finish and the control panel is easily accessible with a color display screen.<br /><br />The scanner works great and I could import the scans into Photoshop Essentials 7 with no problems.<br /><br />I really like the fact that the paper tray holds 250 sheets which keeps me from having to refill very often.<br /><br />I have only two negative comments: The noise level when printing is quite high. Since it is wireless I can move it across the room to alleviate the noise level. Also the documentation is a bit slim. The best thing to do is to download the PDF manual from the Epson website for more detailed information about how to use the printer. But these are minor problems compared to the overall high quality of this printer.<br /><br />I have always been a user of HP printers but all the negative reviews I have seen I decided to go with a new vendor and I think I made a good decision.;;5.0;;December 10, 2011;;15;;16;;0.9375

Only issues are that we cannot figure out how to scan from the buttons on the machine...it will not recognize our computer. Other drawback is that the toner cartridge that comes with the unit only lasts for about 50-60 pages worth of printing so you may as well buy the high output cartridge when you purchase the printer.

Printing regular bond from the paper tray worked perfectly. I misunderstood the owner manual's instructions on "open manual feeder door" so could not print envelopes or labels. The email tech assistance wasn't very helpful with this problem. After several email evolutions, I called 1-800-Lexmark, expecting the usual delays and marginal responsiveness that we have learned to associate with free tech assistance. Not so with Lexmark! After hardly any recorded phone tree queries, I was speaking with a human in less than 2 minutes. He was attentive and correctly determined I'd loaded all the printer driver and other software correctly, so transferred me to the hardware dept. There another efficient, attentive techie took a minute to set up another E260d in front of him, so we would each see and do exactly the same thing. Big dummy me, had been opening the entire front panel instead of the actual "feeder door" which is the middle section on Amazon.com's photo of the printer. I wish the manual had been clearer on exactly what was the feeder door (like a photo of the opened door), but the outstanding tech support made up for it and then some. I am a Lexmark fan now and will buy other of their products.<br /><br />After my 20 years of suffering through mediocre tech support from various companies, Lexmark really shines in their helpfullness and cooperation. No giving me the third degree, no wanting all kinds of detail to prove when and where I purchased the printer. No hassles whatsoever!

Photo printing needs adjustments, mine are not flesh tone but more sunburn looking. Text black could be a bit darker but I am assuming thats OEM toner is why its not as black as I would like, but very doable. I can change the darkness by increasing it some.<br />5. Copies are good.  I like being able to put two copies on one page, even four on one page. Thats a nice feature to help save paper. The printer copies fine, copy output (1st Page) is slower than my Canon D880 printer/fax/copier but thats not a big deal.<br />6. Setup was good, fairly easy for the most part.<br />7.

This does not allow me to preview and edit the scanned image before saving it.  This is important to me because I do digital photo and document scanning of old photos and old documents and it would be much quicker to be able to fix them before saving them.  The printer is set up to scan immediately and save the image to a folder.  Then I would have to select print and chose the image and select the paper all before it offers me the chance to edit.  What if I'm scanning 100 old photos and I don't want to print them.....I just want to edit them and save them for my work and future use?<br /><br />The photo editing tool provided is not very good.  The advanced editing tool does not even allow cropping of pictures.  I would have to actually go through the steps of setting a photo up to be printed before it even lets me crop.  Again that's annoying if I don't even want to print, just want to edit.  The tools are limited and not as easy to use as other software.  It does not offer a photo gallery to view all of one's photos.  The only way to see the photos is if you chose the "print photo" option.  It spreads all the photos out too much because it anticipates you want to check of print options for each.  So it's not great for hunting through a file of 200 photos.<br /><br />The look of the printer is sleek and it's nice that the Canon Pixma MG8220 has a tray for photo paper and a separate tray for regular paper.  The photo paper printing is fast and sharp.  So far the tone is warmer than normal.  I used up the yellow within two hours.<br /><br />I am thinking about returning the printer.  I am not sure.  I would keep it if I could get a photo/pdf scanning and editing software to ad-on that would work well with the printer.  Prior I was using Lead Technology software provided by HP.

I was instructed to call Brothers at the same 800 number to obtain the reference number and "have the paperwork faxed" so that the warranty would be covered. After 30 minutes of Brothers "customer service" reading from a script about "procedures", "policy" and saying I should have "never been allowed to take to a local service center", she said that I need to take back the printer, resume "troubleshooting process" and then file an "ASC Complaint" which would "trigger corporate to  become involved". I said that product was clearly defective, their own center said parts were needed so additional troubleshooting was absurd and I was well within the one year warranty period. Even a second supervisor finally admitted that this was an outside contracted warranty company by Brothers and could provide no "options" for "end users". I was told to have the service center "call whoever they normally contact at Brothers", no one specific. They said that their policy would not allow a 3 way conference call with their own service center to try to work thru the issue.

On the ink-saving settings?  I was confused, but chalked it up to user error (it warned me about turning off the printer while the ink-jets were priming, which I foolishly did).  So I ordered new ink cartridges--none of which were acknowledged by my printer.  Neither refurbished nor name-brand Epson cartridges worked with this printer.  It was like they weren't even there!  I later found out that this is a chronic problem with the Epson printer and that a lawsuit is moving forward against them for this "planned obsolescence" that renders the printer all but useless without the purchase of new "chips" that allow it to read cartridges after the originals are drained.  Without these chips, there is absolutely no work-around to make your printer work.  You either buy them . . . or you have a $60 paperweight.<br /><br />While I would never fault Amazon or the seller for their excellent service--quick, efficient, and all in order--my Epson is going back where it came from, which as near as I can tell is one of the shallower pits of hell.;;1.0;;January 28, 2012;;22;;28;;0.785714

RPRDRSH651YTH;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3FXQ7NJY30P0N;;Printer;;B002ZIPKQO;;Samsung ML-2525W Wireless Mono Laser Printer;;An incredible investment.;;My situation: I just started college and right off the bat, there were situations when I needed to print. I simply needed to print text documents and essays every once in a while. Even though I don't print a lot, buying an inkjet printer just seemed a bit impractical for me. Having owned a couple of them in the past, I know how tedious and annoying it was to keep having to buy refill ink cartridges. I wanted to put all of that in the past and turn over a new printing leaf.<br /><br />Although I was willing to invest the extra cash into a laserjet, the prices for most of them still seemed impractical. It seemed the best of the best were at least $200+, which was well over my budget. Finally I come across this item, as well as the HP LaserJet Pro P1102w. Both printers seem to compete extremely well and the features that they boast, such as wireless printing, were very appealing. After reading different reviews, I was starting to move more in favor of the P1102w. Having worked in electronics retail for over three years, I understood the popularity of HP printers and felt a slight bit of comfort around them compared to Samsung printers. Samsung is the only company I go to for monitors and TV screens, but I was still unsure of the quality of their printers due to the fact that I had no personal experience with them and a very small amount of them are actually sold retail. A lot of customers reviews have complained that the setup for this printers was horrible, which made me worry. But after using this printer, I have to testify that they either know nothing about how computers work, or they're just plain stupid.<br /><br />Amazon loves to display the featured sellers first and keep the underdog sellers with the best prices under wraps. I was almost fooled into paying more from a featured seller, but I continued to search for another 20 minutes and found a seller that offered the product brand new with $20 shipping, and the total was still well under $100. Knowing how very little I paid for this product, I was willing to go through any annoyances this product had to offer. Customers have also complained that the cost of printing was too high and that the starter toner has next to nothing in it. I figured I could use the money I saved and put it towards a new toner in the future.<br /><br />I ordered the product and received it in half of the time that I expected it to come in. Just goes to show you that featured sellers aren't always the best sellers. The setup for the product was stupid simple. I took the printer out of the box, removed all of the tape, and inserted the toner. I popped in the installation CD and did everything that it told me to. It prompted me to plug in the printer to the computer to set it up wirelessly. The printer could not detect my encrypted network right off the bat, so I typed it in manually and it connected to it with no issues. A minute or two later, it was done. Like literally, THAT WAS IT. I'm not understanding how difficult the setup was. There's pictures and diagrams all over the product and installation program, a child could do it, SERIOUSLY!<br /><br />I've had the product for three months now and I have to say that this is one of the best online purchases I have ever made in my entire life. I haven't had a single issue with this printer, not ONE. The semester is coming to a close and I have only used 97% of the starter toner! Page count on the printer is only 47 pages. (I'm taking full advantage of the 300 pages that the university offers a semester.) If I do the math correctly, this toner will last me well through 1500+ pages!  I can see this printer and it's starter toner lasting me throughout the rest of my college career.<br /><br />PRO TIP: If you want to save on toner, go to the printing preferences, turn on the 'toner saver' option, and uncheck the 'darken text' box. Your prints will still come out very dark and pristine as if it came out of a industrial-grade Xerox machine. (Unless you like to over analyze things.);;5.0;;November 21, 2010;;8;;9;;0.888889

You've been warned. :-)<br /><br />The decision to go with this Canon D480 all-in-one printer was a gamble for me.  My previous printer was a Canon color all-in-one ink jet unit (MP360 ) that died prematurely and went to an early grave after barely 3 years of very lite use.  I was really concerned about buying another Canon device or ink jet model.  The root cause for failure on the MP360 was it's uncorrectable ink pump/head issue, so I opted to return to the B&W toner cartridge models.  I learned that no matter how easy it might be to take off a few cover panels, these Canon's are NOT designed for easy service and repair (even with my tech background).  No wonder they try to charge $$$ if you consider getting one fixed instead of replacing it.  They don't want to fix 'em either! HA<br /><br />I need the capability for an occasional fax and scan in addition to the obvious printing.  Deciding not to buy the individual components, I reviewed all the multi-function units I could find.  Unless I was willing to shell out some serious $$$ and buy a business model, my choices all hovered in the $300-500 range.  This model might be ok for a small or home office (SOHO), but the plastic materials and strength of the components are NOT like those found on previous devices.  With any type of heavy use, I can NOT see this model standing up to any bumps or long term wear.  For example, this unit has a flimsy tab that extends at the end of the output tray (necessary to use or the papers end up on the floor) and one little bump could break it right off.  The ADF and scan cover on top feels like it was made as lightly and cheaply as possible.  You'll have to treat this unit easily and carefully or it probably won't hold up.  It might be a move to reduce weight and material costs, but it borders on the overdone effort.  Sadly, many/most of the models in this price range have the same anemic disease of reduction.<br /><br />So far, printing output has been of a decent quality, as expected for a toner model, including the handy duplex/2-sided feature.  Definitely not publishing grade or quality but ok for internal business/office use or at home.  I'm still on my "starter" cartridge (why couldn't they just put a full cartridge in when shipping?!) after a few months of lite printing.  Power-up from a cold start is quick and just a little noisy for around 10 seconds.  Wake-up is also quick when tossing over a print request.  The unit is not very quiet, but can be tolerated if the duty cycle is short.<br /><br />In order to use the web-access features for checking the settings, you need to install the TCP/IP-Networked connection.  If you use the USB connection, you won't get this functionality (I've installed both USB and TCP/IP connections on my system).  Even though I downloaded all the latest patches and software from Canon's site, I didn't need to update the firmware as it arrived with the latest version available.  Supposedly this fixes the bug for setting a default mode (copy vs. fax vs. scan) for those printing over a network.  I didn't find the included software to be great, user-friendly, or with helpful features, but your mileage may vary.  You won't be missing out on much if not installed at all.  Others have noted issues (confirmed) with an indexing feature in one of the programs (takes forever on app startup, best to avoid).<br /><br />I've have problems with the very temperamental faxing capability as well as the volume control when attempting to fax.  Even though there are settings to turn down the volume, the choices do NOT make a difference.  Either the speaker is on at a very loud volume (maybe useful for troubleshooting, but annoying for anyone nearby) or muted.  My previous Canon didn't have nearly the issues when sending and using a voip (vonage's version) connection for a phone line.  However, if you run an Internet search, you'll find that for most people now using a G3-mode fax unit on voip, it is gamble.  Sometimes it's going to work if you drop down the speed to transmit at 9600 baud and turn off ECM (error correction), and many times it will not work at all when trying to send.  For being able to handle an analog quality connection and all the "within spec" (ITU, T-38 spec) noise in doing so, I find this unit just isn't cutting it on voip.  I called Canon's tech support and reached a helpful and courteous person in the afternoon.  Another call to Canon's tech support in the early evening left me disappointed with the attitude and help received - so 50% grade, not so good (but typical).  To be fair, it's not all Canon's issues when dealing with phone connections.  However, it looks like I'm stuck with a less-than-acceptable grade for these issues.<br /><br />Scanning worked for basic 8.5x11 sheets, but I ran into problems initially with the set-up and configuration of the software to receive scans.  It would not automagically configure in Windows as it didn't want to recognize the supported device.  Oddly enough I didn't receive an error when the software was installed the first time.  The software's testing feature confirmed the communication was not working.  Deleting the software and rediscovering the device again was necessary before I could install and use the software to take in a scan.  Scan quality at 300 dpi was a bit poor, but no surprise there.  I think the whole scanning feature also dropped in quality from the previous model.  *sigh*  I didn't test it much and realize others have put it to more rigorous use and also found a few other concerns.<br /><br />Reading the user manual left me seeking additional sources for answers.  I even installed and tried the more inclusive "e-manual" on my computer.  I was still left wondering about a few things, and thus my calls to tech support.  Documentation is written in understandable English, but don't expect any detailed explanations whatsoever.  The same goes for the unit's limited display window.  Most features and setting seem to be randomly organized, but able to be hunted down if you take the time to search.  A "secret" feature that wasn't mentioned anywhere in the documentation was reached by pressing the " menu " key followed by the " # " key.  It's an extended listing and group of advanced settings.  Be careful what you change in here or you may find yourself talking with a grouchy tech support person @ Canon for poor-quality help.<br /><br />By the way, I inquired and was told there is NO command or button to reset your device back to defaults or to erase all your personal information in the unit.  Today's electronic devices, not just computers, use chips and drives to store or cache your data and use logs.  My fax log shows all the numbers I've attempted to send to (and most in failure!).  It supposedly rolls over after the 60th fax, but no way to clear the log.  I was told to leave the unit unplugged for "a couple hours" to possibly erase all settings (??!!??).  I haven't tried it yet or proved this to be correct.  Keep this in mind should you be considering giving this unit back, selling it, or giving it away - your info may be still inside.  This is a known and documented security issue for today's intelligent, data-handling products, so keep it in mind.  Contact the manufacturers for info and procedures for clearing a device to protect yourself.  It might be an "all or nothing" wipe, so apparently Canon wasn't concerned about your time in set-up or your privacy/data protection either.  Shame!<br /><br />A huge rebate was available at the time I purchased this model at it's discounted "sale" pricing.  It is a JOKE that this product is passed off as a $1,000+ MSRP unit and then discounted heavily for it's "normal" retail/sale price.  This model may have a lot of features (as all-in-one printers all do!), but no way would I put it in that category or ranking of a $1000+ machine.<br /><br />The unit works for now, but I would reconsider if I had to do it again.  Definitely not the worst choice, but room for improvement.;;3.0;;April 28, 2010;;28;;28;;1.0

I thought it could be especially handy. So with a quickness, I bought it.<br /><br />I got it home... it took me (no kidding you) an hour and a half to initially install. Despite the fact that it was prompting me for some msi file that was missing in action (not on my system or on the disk) everything was working pretty good.... at first. I noticed off the bat it was kinna slow, a bit noisy and I got a paper jam (which judging from the other reviews Ive read, is a fairly common problem with this printer) The eprint thing is sketchy at best - it delays a lot, and takes hours at times to print at all. And it would not print attachments in the emails, either.<br /><br />Well.... next thing I know, it killed my network connection after rebooting my system (am on Windows 7 64 bit) It took FOREVER to figure out how to fix that issue, and make it so my network wouldnt fail everytime I rebooted my system. I tried for hours to fix it. I ended up uninstalling everything in trying to fix it (which didn't, in the long run) but my boyfriend managed to get my network working again.<br /><br />So Im back to start, network is good. I figured, ok now its fixed, and Ill just reinstall everything, right? WRONG! I reinstalled it..... and at first, I was getting installation errors (same thing with the missing msi - but worse this time, as it refused to finish the install) Solution center was fubared and would only give me an error when I opened it. Id also get errors that the cartriges were wrong for this printer (what?!??!?! they came with the printer!) Somehow, not exactly sure how tho, it stopped giving me the cartridge error, but the solution center refused to open yet still. I installed it only a dozen times... it would not finish the install, and sadly... one cannot scan anything into ones computer without it being present. Not even using the fancy little screen.<br /><br />During installation, I, against my better judgement, disabled my AV and firewall - it still would not install. I even attempted to download the full install package from their website - same errors. I tried finding a solution on their website - I found nothing. I attempted to apply a patch when my network got messed up and the patch said I had no HP software installed (well, couldve fooled me since I just installed it!) and claimed I didnt need it. I was gonna call tomorrow, and see if I could get it fixed, but judging by the numerous complaints about how they outsource and have no viable solution, don't think I will bother. I certainly don't want another piece of crap printer replacement.<br /><br />Now, I am a software geek - and I do tech stuff for a living. Ive never encountered anything I couldn't fix, install or figure out with time - til now. After TWO DAYS of anguish over this stupid printer, I am finally hell bent on taking it back. And I wont be replacing it with an HP. If youre tempted like I was..... don't buy it, just walk away.... and go look at canon or kodak (anything but HP) If HP can't be bothered to make software that can be easily installed for a printer, with all the components being present, then they don't deserve my money.

Canon has made printers for a while, so the software and the printer work nicely together.<br /><br />It's when you start using the fax machine that you realize that Canon needs to spend some more time developing the software and the user interface.  The good news is that it works.  The unfortunate part is that you will spend some time fighting with it.  There are some really odd concepts here; for example, by default it will make you type the phone number in twice to send a fax (I tend to look at the fax itself to type in the number, and it's already in the machine when it asks me to confirm by typing it in again - who thought this was a good idea?).  You can turn the feature off, but you'll spend some time working through non-intuitive menus (and an even less helpful manual) to figure it out.<br /><br />There are many other odd user-interface issues, for example: the stop button doesn't clear everything, there is no way to get out of setup except to wait for a while, the in-use light stays on, even when it isn't in use, and so on.<br /><br />So, the fax works, and seems to work pretty well, but Canon's engineers really need to spend some time looking at other machines to understand how people expect them to work.<br /><br />On the positive side, the sheet feeder works quite nicely.  It really does grab one sheet of paper at a time (which in my view is why this printer is better than the current HP crop despite the UI problems), and I love the manual sheet feeder.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pretty happy with it - I use it equally for faxing, copying and printing - but a new user interface, and some better setup software would make this an outstanding product.;;4.0;;October 16, 2010;;6;;6;;1.0

Then it takes a month for a non-English speaking tech person to tell you that your problem is - you have to make your router company fix the problem.  It also seems to be eating a lot of ink.

This is my third HP printer and is the best to date.  I don't know why some people knock this printer.  Some complain that the touch screen requires too much pressure.  It does need more pressure than some of the new cell phones or IPads but it is not that bad at all..  Some say it is too noisy..  Not true.  It is by far the most quite HP printer I have used.  Also had a Cannon and this HP is the most quite.<br /><br />Now for the pluses..  The set up is so easy..  I use a Mac computer.  I just followed the CD prompts and with in about ten minutes it was up and running. It is very fast and the print quality is great.  I love the print on both sides of the paper feature.  I like that it has 5 cartridges.  So only the cartridge which is low is replaced.  The HP 564 and HP564xl cartridges are easily available on eBay or Amazon at a much lower prices than the office supply stores or the HP store.  My last Hp printer used the same 564 cartridges and they last a long time especially if you use the fast draft setting.<br /><br />So from my experience with this printer, I would buy another and would not be set back by the one star reviews.

After using the printer for the last 6 months, I have been very impressed with its performance and the printer has handled everything I can throw at it.<br /><br />The photo printing is great, which is to be expected from a photo printer, but I've been very impressed with how it handled printing graphics.  I designed of all our stationary with photoshop and indesign, using a mix of color text and graphics, and our stationary was printed flawlessly.  We printed Save the Date cards, invitations, thank you cards, envelopes and more, and we never had problem.  This printer handled it all with very high-quality printing and saved us a bundle vs. comparable outsourced printing.  Even with all of the repetitive printing of invitations, etc., I never came across any issues with printer head alignment, clogged nozzles, or ink smudges and its large format design means that you can feed pretty much any paper size through it and it will print out like a champ.  The borderless printing option is also a very nice touch that we used extensively with our stationary designs (everyone thought we had it professionally printed).  Although that setting is originally used for photos, it works well with graphics as well.<br /><br />I am happy to say that this printer was a great investment.  I was able to make everything I needed for the wedding with this printer and with the added bonus of a great photo printer.  For everything that it does, it is an excellent value.;;5.0;;October 17, 2010;;7;;7;;1.0

Installation took about 10 minutes at the most.  I have Norton anti-virus program and was never asked to disable it (don't know why you would).  Also we have a home network with 3 computers and everyone can use the printer with no problem (2 computers running on XP home and 1 on XP Pro.)  As for the pictures they are amazing.  It takes about 2 seconds to swap out the black cartridge for the photo cartridge and your off.  4X6 borderless prints at the maximum dpi (4800X1200) in less than 60 seconds and 8X10 in about 90 seconds.  Its fast and no one will never know that you printed the photo.  I have had family members ask me where I had my digital pictures developed.  The pictures are just amazing you will be in shock when you print the first one.<br /><br />Yes, there is a lack of directions but just do a little poking around and you can figure out how to use the printer.  <br /><br />This was a gift to me and I would recommend if you know someone who wants a photo printer to get this one or another HP.  HP makes the best photo printers as far as I have found.  And the ink is much cheaper than any other printer manufacture (about $19.99 for black, $24.99 for photo and $34.99 for tri color).  <br /><br />Lastly paper does matter.  If you want to frame a photo buy the good stuff.  The price seems steep but $20.00 for 60 photos' is really not that bad (just a lot to shell out up front). <br /><br />Happy Printing!;;5.0;;December 26, 2003;;21;;21;;1.0

I have three computers in my home, and it's nice to have it in a "central" area.  Also, though I don't really do this, I'm sure it's nice to be able to print from your phone.<br /><br />Currently Amazon.com has very little information listed about this printer, so I thought I would go into a little more detail. .  .<br /><br />This printer offers "eprint".<br /><br />About ePrint<br />HP ePrint lets you print from virtually anywhere to an HP printer that supports ePrint. Once enabled, ePrint assigns an email address to your printer. To print, simply send an email containing your document to your printers' address. You can print images, Word and PowerPoint documents, PDFs, and photos. You can view and manage print jobs sent to your printer using your printer Job History that is available on ePrintCenter. Note: HP ePrint provides convenience printing. Documents printed with ePrint may appear different from the original. Style, formatting, and text flow may differ slightly from the original document. For documents that need to be printed with a higher quality (such as legal documents), we recommend that you print from the software application on your computer, where you will have more control over how your printouts appear.<br /><br />This printer will "duplex" - Print on both sides of the paper.<br /><br />Borderless printing<br /><br />250-sheet input tray and 150-sheet output tray<br /><br />If you're not using wireless, you can use Ethernet.<br /><br />It says that it's supposed to use up to 50% less energy than color lasers.  Energy Star Qualified.<br /><br />I had no problems setting it up on three computers (two Windows 7 and one XP)<br /><br />I haven't had an inkjet printer in several years, but overall it works just like ones I've had in the past except that now there are three color cartridges and one for black.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.

You can hear the roller turn and turn and turn some more, but the paper never drops so it isn't pulled through to the print heads. At this point take a 5 minute break - yes it says 3 minutes but mine took 5 minutes - and when you come back it will have lined up the heads and printed. The rest of installation is easy if you closely follow the instructions (pull out the tray where the paper ends up before printing and connect the cable to the printer at the correct time).

It is fast enough, very sharp, and easy to use (if you are not trying to figure out why it is not printing).<br /><br />But, when installing on a wireless network, the instructions are confusing. I ended up with a USB installation because it said I should have it connected by wire for simplicity. Once I cleared that and back-tracked, I found I should have gone completely wireless from the start. That setup was simple.<br /><br />Now, the printer just does not print for 5-10 minutes the first time I try after not using it a while. I went through all the written support with no answer, then called and got one of those endless trouble-shooting support people. They have to go through some long list before even approaching the problem. The call ended when he asked me to unplug the router (there was NO problem with the wireless connection, because I checked the printer wirelessly when it was not printing). I forgot that Skype would disconnect when the router disconnected. He took my phone number to call back if disconnected, but did not.<br /><br />On the simply user-unfriendly side, setting up default printing settings is not explained and is not obvious to me.

However, the memory module is a 144-pin PC100/133 SO-DIMM.  This is very out of date memory.  You would think that out of date memory would be dirt cheap but it is not.  Compare prices and you will find that it costs about as much as 4 GB of the very latest memory because very few manufacturers still produce it and very few retailers stock it.  Even if that memory is more than adequate for the printer's needs, Brother should still use something more modern to keep the costs down.<br /><br />--------------------<br />I have a network with machines running Windows Vista, Mac OS X Snow Leopard, and Ubuntu 9.04 Linux.  This printer worked with all three operating systems with no tweaking at all.  In fact, the only headache was that the Windows software provided by Brother required a reboot after installing (I thought we left Windows 95 far behind...).  The Mac immediately recognized the printer via Rendezvous and was ready to print within seconds.  What surprised me the most, however, was that Linux saw the printer and configured itself right away.  Brother offers Linux drivers, but there is no point in even downloading the print drivers as CUPS handles it out of the box.  For scanning, you should install the Brother "driver" which is actually just a very tiny daemon that the printer contacts when you press the scanning button.  All the daemon does is kick off the appropriate shell script, which are located in /etc/local/Brother/sane.  It is all very configurable and if you know your scripting, this printer is MORE capable on Linux than it is on Mac or Windows!;;4.0;;October 2, 2009;;37;;37;;1.0

I had excellent service out of the 970 but it all of a sudden quit working because the light says it needs a new color cartridge - even though in my many years of owning it, that error never happened - the color just faded until you replaced it.  Looking at replacing the color cartridge for $35 with no guarantee of it working, prompted me to add $45 and get a brand new one.  The decision wasn't difficult as I've owned HP printers for 20 years problem free, beginning with the Laserjet II.<br />Just finished installation of the printer on a Vista machine - the second time around, because the first attempt resulted in nothing but a hardware problem with the printer refusing to print even a test page.  After conferring with the HP on-line chat technician (excellent service) I was told that my printer had to be replaced and he gave me the option of sending it back to Amazon and having it replaced by them, or - allowing HP to replace it directly with immediate shipping.  Because of my trust of HP and the rapid replacement I chose them.  On unwrapping the replacement printer I found a large sticker on the back which reads "REMANUFACTURED."  Huh?  My former printer was brand new out of the box and never printed a page and they replace it with a remanufactured device?  Back to on-line tech chat where I was informed by the "floor supervisor" that "we always replace them with a remanufactured printer."  Well, that's fine, but I was never informed of that fact so here I sit with a remanufactured printer instead of a new one, for the price of a new one (albeit a very good price - but it was advertised as new).  So, that's an automatic knock of at least on star, being kind at that.  The second demerit star is for the print cartridges.  Using the HP Toolbox I checked the ink level of the cartridges.  The black one was fine - it showed 100% but each of the three color cartridges are only about 75 - maybe 80% full.  That's after printing 6 pages total, 2 black and white and 4 color.  The color pages were black and white stock market charts (very little print/ink of any kind) with just a few scattered small colored arrows.<br />I think the reduced price by HP is like the free printers that come with a new computer - they're getting them into customers hands to sell replacement ink cartridges.  Like someone else wrote in their review, I think they are selling disposable printers.  Suspect that I'll get a lot of service out of the printer, but if it ever needs print heads it's obvious that it will be printer replacement time.<br />The print quality is outstanding and every bit as good as any laser printer I've ever had.  It prints very fast for an inkjet and I've had no problem at all with download time, it prints within 3 to 5 seconds of hitting the print button, with no delay between multiple pages .  Am just disappointed with HP and their replacement policy along with less than full ink cartridges.;;3.0;;February 3, 2010;;41;;42;;0.97619

When I bought it, I was looking for an all-in-one laser to replace my color all in one that was costing way too much for ink. I decided to go with a laser since i rarely if ever need color. My primary needs were copying documents - printing tax documents - coupons - directions - etc, and i wanted to ability a small stack of papers into the computer to eliminate having to store lots of paper documents in a filing cabinet. This brother fit the bill perfectly. The printing speed is more than fast enough, the auto sheet feed scanner works great. The printer can do duplex printing to save paper. It can also copy to documents and duplex them onto one paper. The auto sheet feeder for the scanner works good. Copying is surprisingly fast. I put a sheet on the flatbed and press copy and it scans immediately and starts printing seconds later. I bought the printer with plans to use it networked. I plugged in an Ethernet cable, and ran the driver install. It found the printer right away and installed the drivers. It works great. The final reason I choose this brother printer is because brother oem toner cartridges are relatively cheap compared to say HP. And cheaper aftermarket cartridges can be found for ever less. In using the printer for the last week, I have not had a single problem with it. The only thing I will mention of concern it's a bit taller than it appears in the photo. It's roughly a foot tall.

Of course, I bought it for a specific reason: to print fine art quality, pigment ink photographs.  If you are a photographer looking for a printer that that can accept a variety of papers and deliver beautiful permanent prints (up to 13x19) every single time for a reasonable price, then I can highly recommend the Pro 9500 Mk II.  I have used it for numerous professional jobs and it has never let me down.<br /><br />Who should NOT buy this printer?<br /><br /> - Don't buy this if you want an everyday printer to print out email, Google maps, web pages, etc. The LUCIA inks that this printer uses are designed to produce beautiful photographs that last 100 years.  It's a complete waste of money to use them for everyday trivial prints.  Buy a cheap inkjet for $100 if that's what you want to do.<br /><br />- Don't buy this printer and attempt to feed it cheap 3rd party inks.  The whole reason this printer exists is to delivery highly stable LUCIA inks to fine photography papers.  Cheap inks defeat the purpose of owning this printer, and won't give the same results.  The LUCIA inks for this printer run about $120 for a set. I go through several sets a year, so the expendables for this printer are not insignificant.<br /><br />- If you want to print 500 photos in ten minutes, please go to a photo printing service. This printer is designed to produce spectacularly beautiful high resolution fine art prints one print at a time.  It takes 5-10 mins to produce a single 13x19 photo, but it's worth the wait.  It's not designed for super high volume speedy printing.<br /><br />- Don't buy this printer if you are not willing to devote the time to master ICC color profiles and professional level photo applications such as Lightroom, Photoshop, or Aperture.  Sure the 9500 can print from any photo program, but if you want to realize the highest quality fine art prints that you can produce, then you'll have to use professional tools.  This means having a proper workflow, a calibrated monitor, and the willingness to learn how to get better at producing fine art prints.<br /><br />- Don't buy this printer if you plan to purchase cheap paper in bulk at Staples.  You are wasting your time and money.  Buy quality fine art papers and this printer will reward you every time.  My favorite papers to use with the 9500 are:<br /><br />Ilford Gold Fibre Silk - one of the best all around Baryta coated papers. Absolutely beautiful<br />Canson Infinity Baryta - another great Baryta paper<br />Hahnem&uuml;hle fine art papers such as Museum Etching, William Turner, and Bamboo - wonderful heavy matte papers<br />Red River Polar Pearl Metallic - a stunning paper that makes photos punchier and dramatic<br />Ilford Premium Photo Glossy - a resin coated paper that I use for high gloss photos or for printing proof sheets<br /><br />-Don't buy this printer if you plan to leave it unused for six months at a time.  You are just asking for a head clog. I sometimes go a month without using it, and have never had a problem, but I wouldn't push it much longer than that.  If you don't need to print anything, then run a test print through every three or four weeks to keep the inks flowing and the head from clogging with dried ink.  You don't want a stubborn head clog when you are under deadline.<br /><br />How to get the most out of this printer.<br /><br />- Download and use the specific ICC color profiles for each paper for which you intend to print.  Most fine art paper companies provide downloadable profiles for this printer.<br />- Calibrate your monitor.<br />- Work in a high gamut colorspace such as ProRGB or Adobe RGB.  If you are shooting and working in sRGB, you simply won't realize the full potential of this printer.<br />- Know how to use your photo application software specifically for printing. Look into getting pro-level software if you don't have it. These applications will allow the computer to do the color management instead of the printer, and you will get much finer control. Plus the editing capabilities of these programs will allow you to make very fine adjustments and tweaks.<br />- By using the paper manufacturers ICC profiles, you won't be limited to the wide borders that this printer imposes on prints done with the built in profiles<br />- Make sure you have up-to-date drivers.<br />- Keep the printer doors closed up when you are not using it to keep the dust out.<br />- Alway keep an spare set of inks handy so that you can replace a cartridge that runs out in the middle of a print.  If you replace the ink promptly, the 9500 will continue the print without a hiccup.<br />- If you want to print on heavyweight (or thick) papers, learn to use the front feed feature.  This printer has a fantastic straight paper path for thick or heavyweight media.<br /><br />If you do all of these things, I hope you will find this printer as enjoyable as I have over the last two and half years.;;5.0;;November 10, 2011;;82;;82;;1.0

R3AECN3Y7OHURX;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A25056SVSVRVOT;;Printer;;B005IVL0RS;;Epson WorkForce 845 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner, Fax, iOS/Tablet/Smartphone/AirPrint Compatible (C11CB92201);;A little underwhelmed;;Just as my second summer session ended, my Brother 490CW finally kicked the bucket. I needed a new printer before the fall semester, so I started scouring the interweb for the best deals. The Epson Workforce 845 received rave reviews here on Amazon, CNET, and other web-based review sites. As such, I felt I was a well informed consumer and that ninety-nine dollars was a real steal. After testing this printer out for a few days, I wanted to address some common concerns I saw in other reviews. In addition, there are some limitations and quality issues that need to be brought up; hence, this review.<br /><br />First, this printer _can and does_ scan to a PC from the printer. It can also scan to a memory card, which then acts as a network drive. I personally feel this is a much better option than scan to PC, as the computer does not have to be on, and I can then access the scans from any PC connected the the network. I had an 8GB SD card that I wasn't using, so I plugged it into the 845. Documents and pictures do not take up enormous amounts of space, so a 8 GB should be fine for the time being.<br /><br />The sliders in the trays are no more or less flimsy than the paper adjusters in other trays. In fact, they were much sturdier than the paper size adjusters on the Brother MFC490 it replaced. However, the trays themselves are a little delicate, I have noticed that they bend and twist a bit when they are full of paper. However, I am not worried about breaking them.<br />Another note about the trays is that the only adjustable tray is tray # 1. Tray 1 is also the only tray that email to print will work from. So, you are somewhat limited in how you can use this printer. Let's say you wanted to leave 4x6 photo paper in one tray and normal paper in the other, you can do that by making tray 2 your default output tray. However, you can't use your email to print function, unless you are only using it to print photos. I also noticed that it is finicky about the paper it accepts. I used some Avery 4x6 name badge sheets I had laying around and they kept jamming up the machine. The 8.5x11 Avery's worked fine though.<br /><br />This printer is very fast, it is much faster than my 490. But after examining the quality of the print and running a few more comparisons, I was able to figure out why. Many printers have three tiers of quality: draft, normal, fine. The 845 has five: fast economy, economy, normal, fine and quality. The "normal" for the 845 is a tier between another printer's economy and normal, whereas the "fine" setting would be another printer's normal. This allows the Epson to print faster than other printers, but at slightly reduced quality. I compared printed spreadsheets side by side, and noticed that the grids were slightly disjointed on sheets printed from the 845 at "normal"(this reoccurred after multiple realignments and from both trays), but not from the Brother. When the quality was adjusted to "fine", the alignment was perfect and equivalent to my Brother printer. This may not be noticeable in everyday documents, and Word docs looked reasonably fine when compared to other word docs. I should note that "quality" mode printed out near laser quality, but speed was greatly sacrificed.<br /><br />It wasn't a real chore to set this printer up. I did not use a USB cord, I downloaded the software and followed the instructions. The Epson pretty much did everything itself.<br /><br />The duplex mode is great, it is very fast and will save paper. In addition, the scanner was fast and duplex function worked well there too. I also felt that the user interface was very intuitive. While CNET was not fond of the touch screen, I felt Epson integrated it into the machine well and it makes the usage simpler and more user friendly.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am fond of this printer regardless of its flaws. I am a graduate student and having a fast print option for notes and drafts while being able to shift quality for my thesis is a benefit. It is important to be aware of this printer's shortcomings though.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It does print very, very fast.<br />- Large capacity paper trays.<br />- Prints beautiful photos.<br />- Scans to a memory card, which in turn acts like a network drive (in my opinion, this is than being able to scan to a pc).<br /><br />Cons:<br />- High speed sacrifices quality.<br />- Tray 1 is the only adjustable tray.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I tested this printer against documents that my Brother printer had produced before it died.;;4.0;;August 17, 2012;;8;;8;;1.0

It's the first printer I've bought just for printing digital photos.  I like the fact that I can print photos, and everything else, from my laptop as I recline and semi-snooze anywhere around the house.  I also appreciate, very much, the color and sharpness qualities of the photos it produces.  I like my homemade prints more than the prints from the labs I also patronize and upload to for printing.  And I find that the total cost per print is almost exactly the same for home printing as for lab printing.<br /><br />The printer is quick in print production.  It's fun to run a camera's collection through.  My favorite printing connection is the direct USB cable from the camera to the printer, printing one selected photo at a time right from the camera.  That means I need to be around the printer as it works and as I work on other computer tasks.  Printing from my remote laptop led to a few minor complications and a bit of image deterioration, but all of that's no deal-breaker.<br /><br />But I have some gripes.  A minor one:  the prints Pixma makes are almost "gooey" after printing - that's no big deal, and Canon states that the prints need drying time.  I've found that almost a month is needed before the surfaces of the prints feel smooth and hard.  No big deal, it works for me, and you certainly don't need to have the prints laying out somewhere to dry; my observation so far is that they dry in a stack as well as they dry exposed singly, but I'm still cautious.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is about the ink consumption.  You buy the ink by the "tank," and a "tank" is a "tank" like my bladder is a zeppelin.  The tanks pass rapidly.<br /><br />So I've had to learn how to stock up.  I've run out of ink too often in the midst of a printing project, and after that I've discovered that a new cartridge pack hasn't really contained all of the tanks I've needed.  My inattention again, but still kind of a surprise.  When a printer uses 5 tanks, a four-pack might not cover all the bases.  Well, "duh."<br /><br />So, a great and very affordable photo printer this is, and all you need is to be prepared to buy lots of ink of the carefully chosen varieties, and you'll have fun making pictures up to 8"x12" surpassing the color and sharpness qualities of your usual mass producers.;;4.0;;January 13, 2011;;12;;12;;1.0

I also have a i860 printer which I have had for over eight years pretty much trouble free. So I am not here to bash Canon. I purchased ($525.00)the 9200 MKII as part of a package deal with one of my cameras thinking it would be a great addition to my photography.... If you don't mind spending more on ink than you did for the printer then I suppose in it's own right it is a good printer.<br />I have only printed about ten photos (8x10's) and have already had to replace all ten ink cartridges ($130.00) There have also been some conflicts with the Canon papers and the type of prints you can print. I like the Photo Rag paper, but it will not print borderless prints and certain regular common sizes which leave you having to get custom mat sizes for your frames.<br /><br />Printing...Now,usually with most printers when you print two or three photos one right after the other the printer will spit them out. Not this printer. After just one print it starts cleaning and cycling for three to four minutes before starting to print the next photo.???  Meanwhile you see the ink levels dropping faster than the gas gauge in a HumVee.. Part way through the next print a ink cartridge runs out. So you replace it. Then it goes into another cleaning cycle again and you see the ink levels drop in the pop up window on your computer monitor! And then another cartridge runs dry, etc.. If you don't print for a couple weeks the ink runs dry and then it goes through it's cleaning and prepping cycle again when you turn it on.<br /><br />Having said that, in the long run you would be money ahead to have your prints done professionaly, which is what I am doing now. I got rid of the printer and am much happier!<br /><br />Pros: Produces nice color prints.<br /><br />Cons: Consumes ink rapidly.<br />  Did I mention it consumes ink?<br />  Canon ink is EXPENSIVE!!<br />  Takes a long time to prepare to print.<br />  Paper is expensive.<br />  Conflicts with Canon paper.;;2.0;;January 9, 2012;;6;;6;;1.0

Overall I find this to be a very good printer, with some really nice features.  However my reason for posting this review is to be helpful to others who may encounter the problem I did with a C000 error.<br /><br />I removed the printer and proceeded to set up the printer.  I made it all the way to step 1 in the set-up and upon power up I encountered a C000 error.  I had tried numerous times to fix the problem, thinking I must have missed removing some piece of the packing materials (there's a lot) that is on the printer.  I finally gave up and called Canon tech support.<br /><br />The tech support rep was friendly and said that the C000 error indicates that the printer is finding one of it's mechanism's jammed during the printer initialization.  His thought was there was some packing materials caught in the internals of the pritner.  He walked me through looking in ever nook and cranny on the printer (very thorough) and yet we found nothing.  He suggested having it repaired at a local service center (or I could mail it in).<br /><br />Not wanting to give up quite yet, and now understanding what C000 meant I continued to figure out what was wrong with the printer before taking it in for repair.  As I continued to look at the printer for any obstructions in the mechanisms I noticed that the printer ink carriage looked slightly mis-aligned.  It appears it had become loose (during the orginal shipment), I simply pressed down on it and I could feel it snap into place.  The printer then worked perfectly, no more C000 error!  I'm surprised that Canon tech support didn't suggest this - so if others have a similar problem you may want to check the ink carriage and see if that may need to be pressed back into place.<br /><br />The duplex scanning and printing is really nice.  The quality of the printer is really nice.  Having it all operate wirelessly (including the scanning to my computer) is really slick feature.  I've only had it a day, but based on my initial use I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this again.;;5.0;;November 5, 2011;;10;;10;;1.0

We have owned a long line of (cheap) HP all-in-one printers, with which I have been reasonably happy, in spite of a few idiosyncracies.  We also own a Brother Laser printer (for larger volume printing; the graphics/photo quality isn't great) and a circa 2008 Canon Pixma printer (kid @ college says it's "junk"), but, I decided I needed a wireless printer as I do more and more of my work on my ipad2 - which meant I needed an Airprint-enabled printer as well.  For the past several years I haved used a MacBook; our household uses a mix of Macs and PC's, so a new printer would have to work as seamlessly as possible with all of these platforms.<br /><br />Though the printer is for my and my family's use at home, I do use it a lot to do work related to the small business I own, including a lot of graphics and photo printing.  Thus, not only was I looking for a wireless printer that worked well with Macs, PC's and ipad, it had to be highly rated in terms of all print quality.  It also had to be reasonably fast and somewhat solidly-built, as it would get a lot of use.  I spent a lot of time lurking in various Office Supply stores testing printers and was very chagrined to see how slow and clunky a lot of the highly-rated printers on display seemed.  It also had to have a reasonably small footprint and be okay-looking.  Oh, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money ($150 or less; I really wanted to be under $100) on this thing since, like many electronics these days, it is probably not something that would last for the long-term.<br /><br />As mentioned above, at the outset, I was leaning toward purchasing another H.P. as they have proved to be very reliable and economical for us, over the years, though each new generation seems to be more cheaply-built than the last...and the reviews that abound online are not great - except that everyone has always seemed happy with their print quality and satisfied with their use of ink.  I did seriously consider and research other brands:  For example, Epsons are well-reviewed, but ratings suggest that their print quality isn't as good as HP's, Canon's and Lexmark's. The Canon Pixma line seems very popular among reviewers, and is highly rated for print quality, but it seems to be well known that they are very thirsty printers...and, there is, again, my college kid's experience with what was a top-rated Canon at the time - it was not great; she could never get it to work properly.  Lexmarks have really good print quality (and, apparently, excellent tech support) but I decided the cost of ink would be too high and I didn't find a model with Airprint.<br /><br />In any event, I eventually narrowed down my choices to some ubiquitous Airprint-enabled HP Officejet all-in-ones but I was bothered by all the negative reviews about reliability and difficulty with set up.  I decided (or guessed...who can decide anything, based on reviews?) that people seemed to like the highly-rated Photosmart line.  So, having become very frustrated with the amount of time I was devoting to this search, and the choices available, I ran across this apparently-brand-new HP Photosmart model, which only had 8 reviews on Amazon (but at least they were all good) and decided to take a leap of faith and buy it.<br /><br />It is a nice-looking (sleek) printer, not too junky-seeming, with a smallish footprint.  I could immediately see, from the setup print test pages, that the print quality is excellent, as expected.  It's also faster and quieter than I had hoped.  The touch display screen is cool, and could be helpful for some uses.  I really like the fact that there is a separate tray for photo paper and the printer knows which kind of paper to use automatically, depending on the print job.  Initially, I was very, very pleased with my purchase.<br /><br />However, I had a heck of a time trying to get the printer to work with my Mac and ipad2.  The setup process was frustrating because it called for use of a USB cord, even though one didn't come with the printer and it made no sense anyway, since I was going to use this as a wireless printer exclusively.  I spent a lot of time with HP tech support:  first with a rep via online chat to figure out the wireless printing and then on the phone with someone who specialized in "Cloud Services" to figure out my ipad connectivity.  We managed to establish a link between the Mac and the printer using the printer's direct IP address...not sure why the drivers weren't working properly but I was just happy to have any link.<br /><br />As for the problems with the ipad2, the HP guys/gals determined that my Router (Belkin 750N) was not compatible with Airprint.  I did some more research online and found out that this is a known problem, just emerging into the general public realm.  Not all routers support Airprint.  HP told me that Belkin routers, in particular, are a problem.  Needless to say, this was very disappointing and surprising since, with all of my pre-purchase research, I had never heard anything about this.<br /><br />BTW, the printer worked beautifully, after setup, with our main PC/Windows 7 in the house.<br /><br />Frustrated that the new printer wouldn't serve all of my wireless needs (but happy with the printer in general), I brought it up to my other house with much trepidation, as it also has a Belkin router, an older one, at that.  Lo and behold, the printer works PERFECTLY with both my Mac and my ipad2.  Apparently, the older Belkin router supports Airprint - who knew?  And now my Mac is using the proper printer drivers...I have no idea why it wouldn't at the other house -- is that related to the router as well -- I have no idea; I'm not a techy.<br /><br />The bottom line:  this is a really excellent wireless all-in-one printer at a good price point which I recommend but I didn't give it 5 stars because I'm peeved that HP/Apple whomever, doesn't make a point about possible incompatibilities with routers...which is a pretty key point if one is buying a printer for its wireless capabilities.<br /><br />Also, since I just started using this printer, I have no idea how expensive the ink is likely to be.  I've heard some chatter that the cartridges are expensive, which won't be the end of the world if it uses ink relatively sparingly like the other H.P. printers I own.;;4.0;;December 8, 2011;;99;;101;;0.980198

I didn't love the flimsiness of the output tray, but print quality was good, speed was acceptable, duplexing worked (although it was slow).  I printed a couple hundred pages per week of black and color.<br /><br />Several weeks ago, yellow ink started printing inconsistently.  Multiple cleanings didn't help.  I swapped to a new yellow cartridge, which leaked all over the place (inside the printer case, all over my floor, etc.).  I returned that cartridge and swapped to a fresh one, which stopped the leak, but the yellow printing was still inconsistent.  I started spending more of my time cleaning print heads than actually printing.<br /><br />I spent a couple hours on the phone with Epson support.  Epson support phone lines are terrible quality - I had to almost shout to be heard, and ask the techs to repeat themselves over and over.  This did not lend to my relaxation or calm demeanor on those calls.<br /><br />Eventually, Epson agreed that the printer was broken, and to ship me a warranty swap unit.  The unit took over 10 days to come in, during which time the old printer totally stopped working - it would no longer detect any ink in the yellow cartridge, and won't print even black unless it's got ink in all cartridges (this is a stupid design, as far as I'm concerned), so I was without a printer at all for over a week.<br /><br />This printer ought not be advertised as a business-grade printer - it's clearly not.  This is my first Epson in quite a while, and will likely be my last.;;2.0;;August 22, 2012;;6;;6;;1.0

I bought it one week ago to use for occasional but very important printing - I'm in law school, and when I need something printed, I need it NOW.  :-)<br /><br />I've used many printers in the past and always had good experiences with HPs.  I also currently own the HP Color LaserJet 2605dn Printer (Q7822A#ABA) which is a $400 color laser (which has been excellent).  Finally,  HP is  an American company, so I was specifically looking for an inexpensive HP laser printer when I bought this.  I realize that I could have gone with a Brother laser for around $100 or so, but I need absolute reliability - no compromises whatsoever.<br /><br />The bottom line is that it met all my expectations - small, quiet and great B&W output for documents.  I don't print much graphics, so I can't comment on that aspect.  By the way, I'm using it with a new MacBook Pro, and  there have been no problems.<br /><br />The printer exceeded my expectation with respect to the speed.  It seems to print very fast - nearly as fast as a larger office HP.  Just my subjective impression - I haven't timed it with a stop watch.<br /><br />The only possible negative is that I didn't find an instruction manual included.  Not even on the CD-ROM.  It may be that I overlooked it because I was in a rush to get going.  But HP has an excellent support website where one can download drivers and manuals for all models, even very old ones.  Further, the set up and install of the printer has been just like every other HP printer I've used.;;5.0;;December 8, 2007;;67;;73;;0.917808

Let me break up this review in the positives and negatives:<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />1) Excellent compatibility with OS X.  I'm currently using 10.6.5 and right out of the box the OS recognizes the printer.  But I installed the driver from the CD anyway because it comes with the scanning software.<br /><br />2) The scanning software is awesome!  No-frills... it just works!  You can scan into tiff, jpg, pdf, etc., and customize the settings in a very brainless way.  I imagine that the scanning software will be great for anyone who isn't entirely computer-savvy.  You can queue up pages to scan via software, as opposed to pressing buttons on the machine itself, in hopes that your computer understands what you're trying to do.  This may seem like a silly "positive"; I put it here because other machines (like some Canon's) require you to do exactly that, consequently suffering from network communication inconsistencies/incompatibilities.<br /><br />3) The print speed is very fast.  The box quotes something like 27 ppm... I don't know if it gets up that fast, but from startup to the first page out I think it only took about 45 seconds.  Subsequent pages came out probably every 2 or 3 seconds.<br /><br />4) The design is rather compact for a multifunction machine.  The buttons do not feel cheap (like some of the cheapo inkjet printers).  Not too bulky; not too heavy.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />1) When doing 2-sided printing, the duplexer is LOUD.  Lots of mechanical things happening that sound like this machine may be subject to wear and tear rather quickly.<br /><br />2) I first hooked this machine up to my Airport Extreme via USB and tried scanning.  The scanning software wouldn't recognize the machine.  So I reconnected it to the Airport Extreme via ethernet-- that worked.  It's too bad because the Airport Extreme has a USB port that's dedicated to a printer, and now I have to use up one of my 4 ethernet sockets.<br /><br />3) While the design is pretty slick, I wish they built it so that the paper doesn't stick out.  I'm not a huge fan of the plastic "dust cover" over the paper tray... it looks like it can break easily if you accidentally open it up wrong.  Also, there's another tray, or fin, that you install to the front that props up the printed pages that come out-- this piece REALLY looks like it will break if you put some weight on it (e.g. your cat decides to stand on it).<br /><br />Nonetheless, this machine is SOOO much cheaper than other ones in its class.  That said- all of the negatives seem acceptable.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />UPDATE: (3.20.11)  I've used this machine for a few months now, and it's starting to jam up more and more often.  It seems that the jamming only happens when I'm printing double-sided.  Some comments regarding the duplexer:  If you plan on printing a long-ish document, like a 20 page essay, then the double-sided duplex is fine for the job.  But if you're planning on printing, say, 100 copies of a single-page double-sided flier, it would be a LOT LOT LOT faster to just handle the double sided printing by hand.  Allowing the duplexer to handle this same print job took a MUCH LONGER time than when I just manually flipped to the back side for the second pass.  We're talking about 1-2 minutes if done by hand, versus about 8 - 10 minutes via duplexer (assuming it doesn't jam).<br /><br />So far, I've accumulated about 1500 pages of printing.  Using "econo-mode" set to 3 (out of 5), I've managed to only use 20% of the stock cartridge.  Not too bad.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />UPDATE: (10.10.12)  If you have upgraded to Mountain Lion, DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!!!  HP had to update their scanning software, which is a complete POS!!  It takes up to 3 minutes to scan one single page black and white at 100dpi.  Total garbage.  What worse is that HP has not fixed this problem since their last update 4 months ago, despite countless Mac Users' complaints.  Update to 2 stars.;;2.0;;December 11, 2010;;104;;104;;1.0

After scouring the net, I found the trick that isn't anywhere to be found in the documentation.<br /><br />So let's get this out of the way right now. If you still have the low toner message after replacing the toner with a Brother brand cartridge, here's what you do.<br /><br />1. Open the front toner compartment door.<br />2. Message reads "Front cover open."<br />3. Press the "Clear" button.<br />4. Message reads "Replace Drum?" and gives you a choice of Yes or No.<br />5. DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS. Instead, type in  *00  on the keypad. (Don't forget the asterisk before the two zeros!)<br /><br />This apparently resets the machine's internal page counter. You should see an "accepted" message. Close the compartment door door, press Stop/Exit and Voila. No more low toner message! Takes about 30 seconds.<br /><br />Now for the review. What I like:<br /><br />- Small, compact footprint.<br />- Works flawlessly from copying to duplex printing to faxing to wireless scanning.<br />- Simple to use.<br />- Simple to set up on a wireless network - don't even need to initially connect it to a computer to set up.<br />- NO warm up time.  Wow. Even from deep sleep mode, it wakes right up when you send anything to it to print or feed anything into it to copy or fax and works instantly.<br />- Replacement high capacity toner cartridge (2600 pages) from Amazon was close to half what the Canon cartridge would have cost - one reason I decided to buy this printer rather than put $85 into a new cartridge on an aging AIO printer.<br />- Using the free Brother iPhone app, I can print from my iPhone!<br /><br />The negatives?<br /><br />-  I didn't love having the low toner warning stay on even after buying their brand and having to scour the internet for an hour before finally finding an obscure, random post by someone who knew the trick for this printer -  that YOU now all  know too. :-) (There's no optical eye on these that you can cover like some of the previous generation Brother printers like the 2170w that allowed you to keep printing LONG after the warning came on, so that trick won't work.)<br />- I don't love that the somewhat loud fan  that goes on when the machine is used at all seems to stay on for 5  minutes or so after the last  activity before it goes silent.<br />- Lifting up the cover to place something on the glass could be smoother.  It seems  to sort of snap up and snap down when you get past a certain point in both directions.<br /> - It's definitely a bit more flimsy feeling than my Canon was, but it's also a lot smaller and lighter.<br /><br />But for the price and the performance, these are too insignificant to me to even knock off a star, especially after finding the low toner message trick. I bought the printer for it's functionality, duplex printing, the relatively low cost of toner, and especially its ability to scan *wirelessly* and allowing you to save in various formats including scanning multiple pages into one pdf document using the included ControlCenter4  software.  Great for signed agreements you can scan and email within a few clicks instead of faxing.  Lots of other All-In-Ones scan, but not wirelessly with this simplicity at this price-point.<br /><br />After 5 months, I still love this printer and think it gives you the best bang for your buck right now.;;5.0;;April 25, 2012;;14;;15;;0.933333

I took advantage of Amazon's free shipping so delivery of printer was a little slower than it would have been if I had used (expensive) air shipping (about 5 working days).<br /><br />The printer was very easy to setup and does a creditable job of printing.

But the configuration was far from easy.  Here are my tips.<br />1. I had a choice of connecting via USB or wireless.  I chose USB as I thought it would be more reliable.  Mistake.  Choose wireless or ethernet if you can. USB does not allow web connectivity even though its connected to a web connected computer.  This removes a lot of the intelligent fuctionality which takes a while to realise.<br />2. Firmware.  Out of the box was some old firmware and the help manuals referred to the most recent firmware so a lot of timewasting later I figured it out.  With the old firmware you have to struggle to find how to update to the latest firmware - the critical thing is to enable web services.  Then it just happens and a restart later and all the menus are different etc etc and all is MUCH nicer.<br />3. Enable web services - see above<br />4. Set everything up via the web interface. It is smooth and powerful.<br /><br />With this I tried printing from my ipad and 'it just worked'.  Very sweet indeed!  With the old firmware my ipad would not find any printer.<br /><br />I've managed to set up shared folders on my PC and get it to scan nicely (its quick) into the shared folder.  Differenty shared folders need to be set up for different settings -eg black and white letters vs photos.<br />I've not managed to 'find' the printer from my 2nd PC in the house.

I decided to give up on the labels and use it just to print documents. I printed those 2 labels and only 2 documents and it's already asking me to replace 3 of the 6 ink cartridges. I emailed EPSON and asked them if they actually put ink in the cartridges. The printer is huge and bulky. In a nutshell, Stay away from this printer.

I have always used either HP, Canon, or Epson.  To my thinking, printers like those made by Brother and Lexmark have seemed to be less reliable in times past. The past 5 months have proved me wrong. This Brother is an astounding printer at a terrific price.<br /><br />All features work flawlessly and print quality is outstanding for this price range.  Brother have upped their game over the last 4 or 5 years and I was tempted enough (after my HP and Canon both gave up the ghost) to look elsewhere.  This Brother Printer (and I still have a Canon Pixma Inkjet for occasional color needs) is just a work horse.  Flawless printing in regular and duplex mode. Originally, I just hooked a USB cable to it... but then set it up (pretty easy) to Wireless via it's built in interface. Works great.<br /><br />Noise: I have seen a few comments about the noise level of this printer.  I find it extremely quiet.  FIrst of all, it is most usually "sleeping" in what appears to be OFF position...in this mode, the printer is totally quiet.  No noise at all. If I send it a print job to it wirelessly, it wakes up pretty quick.. wait... let me time:  It woke up and printed a single page in 20 seconds.  So, keeping the printer in standby mode is not a problem (unless 20 seconds is too long for you to wait.<br /><br />The printer returns to a quiet state after another 10 seconds (after printing) and then stays in this "alert" state for about 10 minutes.  It is during this time that the printer will make some noise.  Quite frankly, I don't usually notice it, it is so quiet. Then the printer returns to SLEEP mode and goes totally silent. So, there really is not a noise issue at all.  In fact, my HP printer was much more noisy.  The fact that it is most usually in Sleep mode, means that it is almost always completely silent. (If I had read all the reviews that said this printer was too noisy, I likely would not have purchased it. And I would have lost out on a great, quiet printer).<br /><br />Cost per page: I am averaging just under a penny a page to print with this... that is so much cheaper than my ink jet! I am using the "toner save" mode, however. In fact, the thought of buying another ink jet with their incredible high cost of ink was one of the reasons I bought this Brother printer.<br /><br />I love that the printer takes an entire ream of paper. I just load it and forget about paper for a long time! And Duplex mode (front and back of page printing, without needing to flip the paper!) has been a great feature that I didn't have before. That too is another savings feature.  The copier works fine. I haven't tried scanning with this printer yet. And the cost per page on this printer... well, that is why I purchased it... this is a money saving baby!<br /><br />Cons?  Yes. One.  The message about LOW INK comes on too soon.  Being cheap, I usually ignore these prompts until the thing truly runs out of ink.  With this printer, I can print several weeks before it really runs out of ink.  FYI.<br /><br />Great printer!<br />--<br />UPDATE 1-15-2012:  Still love this printer!  I wanted to update this about the one "con" I listed... Ink.  More specifically, the message that you get to change the ink ("toner low message").  My advice is to ignore it. I printed for over two months before it truly ran out of ink.  Even then, I never got a single bad printed copy. No "light print jobs," no "missing lines of text." When this printer really runs out of ink (OK, toner), it will simply refuse to print. Then it is time to replace the cartridge. I replaced mine with a Brother branded High Capacity toner cartridge...at least this first time. I would love to hear comments from others who may have used cheaper 3rd party cartridges... do they work well?  Or should I stick with a Brother branded cartridge?  Enjoy this printer!<br /><br />--<br />Update 9-1-2012:  Still going strong...just replaced first full toner cartridge. I just ignore the low toner printer warnings (however, you can turn off... I turn off the STOPPING because of low toner, to do this, Go to General Settings, and then number 4. Replace Toner, set to Continue.).  Wait until you see the ink not filling the page or getting streaky.  Then replace.  You will go months past the first low toner warning (depending on volume of printing obviously).;;5.0;;January 15, 2012;;13;;13;;1.0

It really walks you through the process very well.  The applications that can be accessed through the printer itself are pretty cool.  These include Disney coloring pages, coupons, etc.  Printing from my camera's memory card was  intuitive.<br /><br />The next step was to install the software on my computers.  This was also easy, although I did have an issue in which the printer picked up an IP address that the router didn't like.  This was solved by searching the HP website to determine how to assign a static IP that was within the DHCP range.  Thankfully the instructions were clear and very easy, because I really don't have much networking experience.<br /><br />After everything was set-up, I printed off a few pictures from my PC.  There is not a multi-page paper feeder and the speed may not be enough for some.  However, for a household like mine, where we will only have occasional printing needs, I think it's more then sufficient.  Even though I haven't yet had an opportunity to use photo quality paper, I think the quality of the print, even on multi-purpose paper, was very good.<br /><br />I then had an opportunity to use the included picture printing software.  My daughter and I had quite a bit of fun setting up different borders, adding text, and choosing different decorations to add to the pictures.  This was pretty darn cool. I am not sure if there is a limit and after I reach that limit it will start charging me, or if this will always be free, but for now, at least, it's free.<br /><br />Finally, I had the need to actually scan something in.  This was a very easy process, and once scanned in you are given the chance to edit the scan, flip it around, etc.  This was my first time ever scanning something in, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I thought the process was very simple.<br /><br />BTW, because it wasn't mentioned in any other reviews and I didn't realize it and almost bought wireless NIC cards:  A desktop computer, connected by Ethernet to the same wireless router as the printer, is able to print to the wireless printer.  The desktop PC's do not have to be wireless.;;4.0;;September 25, 2010;;14;;14;;1.0

I got excited about the HP6000 w/automatic duplex, bought one, set it up, and discovered that the printed image when the sheets are run through the duplexer can't cover more than 9 inches on the long side (11 inches) of a sheet of letter-sized paper.  This meant that my bookfold-formatted newsletters, with a 10.5" image than reaches up to .25" from the edge of the paper on the 5400, was shrunk by the 6000 to 9 inches - fonts, photos, what have you, all made narrower, not to mention the impact on a bookfold formatted document that still has a .25 inch "page" margin on the spine - NOT ok!!!<br />....Getting HP to confirm this required over 90 minutes on the phone.  They had no specs, no equipment on hand to verify the problem I was trying to describe, and it was exhausting for all concerned.  This was similar to the 3 hours I spent with service reps when I bought a K550 Officejet.  The 550 had no duplexer but had a similar problem.  It would not print to the magic .25 distance, and would print to .47 inch then simply CLIP a small slice off the printed image, not shrink it).  Except in the case of the HP K550, the customer service braintrust convinced me to swap the unit I had for a SECOND printer to get the result I wanted.  This which meant ANOTHER 3 hours on the phone with a second 550, before I sent the second unit back as well.<br />....Luckily with the 6000 I (almost) knew when to give up.;;1.0;;January 28, 2010;;8;;9;;0.888889

I had purchased it for the cheaper cost of ink supplies. But I ended up really disliking how long it took to "warm up" and print. I also wanted to find a wireless printing solution that was independent of a computer having to be turned on and connected to the printer. The Brother resolved all of these issues. Replacement ink is relatively inexpensive and it boots up and is ready to print in a short time. It feels very solid and well built and looks sharp sitting on the desk. It also supports Google Cloud Print via a simple firmware update located on the Brother website. I can easily print Google Docs from an iPad.

It replaced a Lexmark E260DN. The Brother is noticeably quieter, slightly faster, can print from IOS devices (eg. iPad) and has much lower toner costs. A few years ago I also had a Brother HL-5250DN laser printer. It was a great printer, BUT after I upgraded to Windows 7 it would change its IP address when the computer was re-booted. To say the least that was annoying and I could not find a fix. Of course that is only a problem if you are using it as a network printer.<br /><br />The new HL-5470DW has no problems what-so-ever. It is setup as a network printer in my home via Ethernet cable. I set the resolution to 600 DPI and configured for toner saver mode. Even with these settings the print quality is very good. Envelopes print perfectly with no wrinkles.<br /><br />Toner costs are reasonable. Here on Amazon a Brother TN720 3,000 page toner cartridge is about $60 (2 cents/page) and a Brother 8,000 page TN750 toner cartridge  costs about $100 (1.25 cents/page). To put this in perspective, the toner costs for most laser printers range from 3-5 cents per page and ink costs for inkjet printers can easily exceed 10 cents per page for text.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this printer again and recommend it highly.;;5.0;;August 15, 2012;;30;;33;;0.909091

I've had it for about two months now and I'm very pleased.  I had a bit of trouble installing it on my ancient laptop which was running Win98 and had only 32MB of ram.  According to the box, my laptop had the minimum requirements, but when I ran the software it told me that I didn't, and refused to install.  I played around with it and finally got it to work and haven't had a problem since.  I also notified HP about this problem since the software and the box say two different things.  They are looking into it.  <br /><br />This printer is fast, does great quality prints and is pretty quiet.  I also really like the sleek design.  The picture above does not do it justice.  I've been getting compliments from co-workers about how cool it looks.  It really is nicely designed and doesn't take up too much space.<br /><br />I've used HP printers for years and have always found them to last an extremely long time.  I usually replace mine because I want a faster one before I replace one for breaking down.  Also, I want to mention that I bought an Epson about a year ago because I heard about how great they were and I was very dissapointed.  The Epson ink cartridges do NOT have new printer heads on the bottom of them, like HP and many other brands do.  Because of this, the Epson print heads routinely dry out, get full of gunk and refuse to print, or cause a lot of smearing on your documents.  I've had to take my Epson apart twice to remove gunk from it, and I am still not satisfied with its print quality.  All other things aside, you should pick HP over Epson just for the shear fact that every time you put a new cartridge in you are also replacing the print head.<br /><br />I brought my 5650 home tonight because I needed to print something on my home computer and my Epson was acting up again.  Installation on WinXP was a breeze.  I didn't have my cd with me so I just downloaded the software from the HP website and had no problems.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a great printer for the price and I recommend it to anyone looking for work or home office use.;;5.0;;September 19, 2003;;46;;46;;1.0

The configuration process is wizard-based and walks you through it via the LCD panel when you turn the printer on for the first time, also have paper handy for test prints.<br /><br />The printer software installation is massive however and takes around 20 minutes or more to complete even on fast machines, so grab a cuppa joe before you fire this up because you'll be idle for a while waiting for it to finish. The printer shows up as a host (computer) in your network by which you can connect to via WiFi or ethernet during the installation process. You can physically connect the printer to a computer via USB but there's really no reason to do so since the printer is network-based.<br /><br />Registering the printer for the *FREE* ePrint service (remote printing over the web) was a snap and the printer's "email address" was generated as part of the registration process. Remote printing via ePrint is easy, simply send an email to the "printer's email address" and attach any documents you wish to print; it queues and prints within seconds of the email send. You can also remotely monitor the printer's status and printer queue via ePrint as well to confirm the document(s) were printed, a very cool free setup I must admit.<br /><br />Regarding ePrint, note that these document types are only supported for remote printing which should suffice for most:<br /><br />[...]<br />The print quality is great and fast, I don't know how fast it chews up ink given I recently got it.

While printing, it's quick and quiet, even without its special Quiet Mode enabled, and I have actually turned down its printing speed at times, to allow for more drying time between prints. I do try to run at least a few prints a week, but even when it was left alone for nearly three weeks, there was no issue with the print head clogging. This may not be a good printer for someone who intends to use it only a few times a year, as it does use large amounts of ink in its cleaning cycles. If you, however, need to print very high quality, medium-large format pictures (whether photos or art) at reasonably high volume, this printer is definitely a good choice.<br /><br />Now for the bad - what seems to be lacking more than the printer itself is the software it comes with - most irritating is its lack of support for 11x14" paper, a standard print and photo size readily available on my previous printer, an Epson Stylus Photo 1280. Its batch printing program, Easy-PhotoPrint, also limits paper type selection based on paper size - perhaps useful if printing only with Canon's paper, but in my experience it handles other brands just as well. The CD/DVD printing option available on European models would have been nice to have as well, though so far I've had no call for it. Points that others have brought up about its size are more or less accurate - it is a behemoth. Instead of sitting next to my computer, it has the top of a shelving unit all to itself, and will overwhelm most desktop space. It also requires space behind and in front for those big 13x19" prints you'll be producing.<br /><br />All in all, the good points of this printer far outweigh the bad, but for a very select number of people. If you're printing only letter sized, there are other printers in Canon's line that do the job just as well. If you frequently need to print larger than 13x19" (it also has no banner printing feature), you'd be better with an actual large format printer. If you are an independent artist, artist group, or small photography studio, however, I would definitely recommend this printer.;;4.0;;August 15, 2008;;35;;35;;1.0

This is still a great all-in-one, however we have been forced to replace it in the office we bought it for.  Why?  In a word, "consumables".  This unit simply tears through toner cartridges.  The office that it is installed in probably prints around 3000-5000 pages a month.  In the past year they have gone through over 30 toner cartridges as well as two drum sets and a belt set for this printer.  The total consumables cost over the one year we have been operating it, is over $2,000!!!!<br /><br />I have replaced this with an inkjet, because, the inkjet will pay for itself within just a few months compared to what it is costing us to operate this brother.<br /><br />I've just purchased and installed one of these at my wife's office and thought I would share my thoughts in a review.<br /><br />This unit was purchased to replace an HP all-in-one that we only installed about 18 months ago.  All I can say about HP all-in-ones is that they are garbage.  Enough about them and on to the Brother review.<br /><br />I did a lot of research on an alternative all-in-one before going ahead and purchasing this Brother, and I'm sure glad I did!  For offices that do a fair volume of printing, require color for graphics, as well as the normal scanning and faxing work, this printer is pretty tough to beat at its price point.<br /><br />The printer ships in a very large box but is actually more compact than you might think.  When we pulled it out of the shipping carton we realized it was actually smaller than the HP L7780 that it was replacing (admittedly the HP has a 2nd paper tray but the Brother is still quite compact for what it does).  The unit is pretty heavy and at 53 pounds you need a real counter or piece of furniture to put it on.  Balancing it on the end of a rickity desk is probably not the way to go.  The plastics for all of the parts are of a very heavy gauge.  One of the hinges on the HP had broken within just a short amount of time and it was nice to see that this Brother actually has higher quality plastics and many of the parts that could break (like the hinges on the scanner) are replaceable components so you won't have to replace your entire all-in-one if one of these parts gives up the ghost down the road.<br /><br />I connected the printer to the office wired LAN and gave it a static IP address.  This took all of about 2 minutes through the basic monochrome control panel.  At that point I pressed the fax and copy buttons together to do a test print.  The test print came right out and looked great.  There is just a bit of curling of lower grade 20 pound office paper with this LED/Laser beast.  I suspect heavier grade paper will remedy that, although curling is common with smaller laser units.  It's worth noting that by default every button press on the control panel emits a very loud beep, but there's a setting that can reduce the volume of this or disable it entirely.<br /><br />Once the printer was on the LAN and I had verified I had a good test print I started installation of the software.  I ran the HP scrubber utility to purge all remnants of the old HP printer from our multiple XP workstations and then installed the Brother software.  It is worth noting that before I installed the Brother Control Center I did disable the anti-virus/firewall software on our machines (Kaspersky).  Installation of the software was very simple.  It warned me about needing to turn off the firewall but found the new printer right away.  Once installation was complete I did a reboot and then told our anti-virus to trust all of the Brother programs and we were off to the races.  I chose to install the full Brother Control Center 3 software package, WITHOUT Paperport (more on that below).<br /><br />Our employees immediately were ooh'ing and aah'ing about how fast this thing is.  They had about 300 pages of statements to print and this new printer ripped through them in about 15 minutes.  Color quality for normal office type applications is very good.  Smaller photos embedded in office literature look good, with nice color saturation.  This is not a photo printer and I'm sure that the results of printing large color photos would be inferior to a quality inkjet printer.  Scan quality was as good as or better than the HP, although color scans with default settings are just a little bit light and banded.  It is worth noting that the scanner is super fast and one of our office software packages even recognized the ADF for remote scans, something that never worked on the HP.<br /><br />Fax operation worked very well too.  Brother has been making fax machines for a really long time so I didn't have too many concerns in this area.  The speed and quality of faxes was quite good.<br /><br />My wife has a Macbook Pro that also runs Windows XP under VMWare Fusion.  I downloaded and installed the latest Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard software from Brother and it printed fantastically from both the Mac and the VMWare XP image.  It's worth noting that just using the built in OS X driver I had trouble printing under XP in VMWare.<br /><br />An earlier review commented that you can't have more than one user on this printer on a network, that you must buy a five user license.  This is simply not true.  We have seven machines and all of them are working wonderfully with this all-in-one.  We did not need to "share" the printer in the network panel of any of the PCs, we simply connected all of the PCs through our network (we chose the "wired network setup" from the install menu) and they are all working great for all functions.<br /><br />If you use the Paperport features that ship on the disc, it is only for one computer and you have to buy additional licenses if you want more machines to be able to use Paperport.  Paperport is an OCR/scanning package for archiving your receipts, etc.  It's bonus software and pretty understandable (to me at least) that you don't get unlimited licenses for this program when you buy the $400 all-in-one.  Brother offers extra Paperport licenses if you really need this software on multiple computers.  You can scan, print and fax with the on-board Brother software without needing Paperport, so I don't see it as being a big deal.<br /><br />I know other reviews have criticized the Brother LED/Laser units for not doing a good job with envelopes, heavy card stock, business card templates, etc.  We don't use this for those features so I can't comment.  What I can say is that lasers are really best at being workhorses for doing a LOT of printing on regular paper as well as the normal fax/scan/copy duties.  If you want to print on all sorts of media, then maybe look at a dedicated envelope printer, label printer, etc.  Or consider a lower quality inkjet and be willing to take the headaches that come with that in trade.<br /><br />The Brother control center software looks pretty good, with some cool things like fax to PC, fax from PC, etc.  I haven't used these functions much but they look very office or home office oriented.  In other words, this is productivity software, not software for helping you do scrap booking.<br /><br />The only criticism I have of the printer is the cost for print materials.  The toner cartridges cost about $50 a piece on Amazon and are only good for around 1500 pages each.  These cartridges are not sold in discounted multi-packs.  It would be nice to see Brother offer 2-pack toner kits for offices that do a lot of print volume, or a kit that includes all of the toner carts.  Additionally there is a drum kit that must be replaced every 25,000 pages and it costs $100.  The unit will also use quite a bit more power than an inkjet printer.  All-in-all we know we will be spending an extra couple of hundred dollars a year to operate this printer, but it is well worth it, considering the speed, utility and reliability compared to the very subpar HP we had been working with before.;;3.0;;January 29, 2010;;16;;16;;1.0

I liked the specs of this printer, and had a positive first impression, so I bought three for my business. What a mistake. That was before I realized how these Canons drink toner like it was water.<br /><br />At first I wasn't too concerned. I know that all new printers come with a starter cartridge that's only partially full and that runs out quickly. But I'm now on the fourth cartridge on each of these printers. I've tried genuine Canon and knock-off cartridges. Even the genuine Canon cartridges are empty in the blink of an eye. I've never experienced a mono laser printer that goes through toner so quickly!<br /><br />We've demoted the Canon's to the desks of our three employees who do the least amount of printing, and we've gone back to Brother MFC-8480DN printers for our primary users.<br /><br />Oh, and I have one more nit to pick with these Canons. If you do a lot of scanning, and you use software that initiates the scan from your computer (as opposed to initiating the scan at the printer), you have to go through a series of button presses on the printer to (1) wake it from sleep, (2) select the scanning function, and (3) change the input source to "remote computer." It ruins the whole point of initiating a scan from your computer.<br /><br />If you're buying a printer for a small business or home office, and you care about the bottom line including ongoing costs, avoid this printer.;;2.0;;February 2, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

I would buy it again and recommend it, despite some serious software problems I encountered.<br /><br />Pros: Scans, copies and prints both sides of the paper, if you want. Excellent print and glossy photo quality; scanner provides 24 bit color resolution in the 250 dpi range (up to 17 MB for 8.5 x 11 inch sheet, before compaction); USB or wireless/wired network capability with standby power usage of only about 4 watts.  On-printer controls work well.  Very low initial cost - it was on sale for about $30 more than the cost of the ink cartridges inside it.  Lightweight and compact design is a better description than flimsy.<br /><br />Cons: The installation CD worked only partially for me on both a laptop and on a desktop computer.  We were unable to get the scanner software to work on my Win XP Pro desktop, despite what I consider excellent tech support from Epson. (Something peculiar/unique to my installation of the OS prevented it from installing.) It all works flawlessly on my Win 7 Pro 64 bit wireless laptop, after some fiddling.  There is only one paper source, so printing photos requires removal and replacement of the usual paper. Ink cartridges are quite small and ink costs will likely be high.<br /><br />Discussion: This printer is now attached via ethernet cable to my wireless router.  I am very happy to no longer have to turn on my desktop computer as a printer server in order to print from the laptop.  I can now leave the NX625 in standby connected to the router at a cost of about a penny a day for power. Ink comes in vacuum packed pouches and is supposed to be used within six months of opening.  Cartridges cannot be removed and later reinserted into the printer presumably because the printer punctures a membrane in the cartridge to release the ink. You know that when Epson essentially gives away the printer that it will recover its costs by selling expensive ink.  A full set of the larger capacity ink cartridges costs over $80 as I write this. I believe they are worth it IF having a printer/copier at home avoids having to drive somewhere and pay any kind of a per copy cost.  If your printing quantity would make the ink cost excessive, buy a different printer or a supplemental monochrome laser to handle high volume non-color printing.<br /><br />The installation CD worked well to set up the printer from my desktop when both were hardwired to the router.  The scanner software could not be made to work, despite excellent tech support. I had previously used Epson Scan extensively with a dedicated scanner and it ceased to work over a year ago on Win2k, presumably as a result of a MS security update, since that is all that I can remember that changed between having the scanner software working and not working.  I suspect the same problem has carried over from Win2K to my present Win XP and Epson has not refined the software to compensate for all MS security updates under all possible conditions for those older operating systems.<br /><br />Adding the printer/scanner software to my wireless laptop did not succeed after several attempts, perhaps due to ambiguous questions like "How are you connected?" The laptop was wireless; the printer was wired.  How to answer?  I tried all the combinations of answers without success and ended up going to the network display, found the printer and told the laptop to connect to it; found the driver on the CD, then the printer worked.  Epson scan did not work until tech support pointed me to the windows\twain_32\ecscndv\escfg.exe file in which the connection button had to be changed to network from local; the IP address of the NX625 had to be highlighted and the add button had to be selected.  Then everything worked on the laptop.<br /><br />The unsuccessful attempts trying to add the software to the laptop also fouled up the previously successful connection from the desktop to the NX625.  That problem was resolved by going to the printer panel under networking and turning off wireless networking, allowing it to automatically get its IP address from the router over the wired ethernet.  Under the failed attempted wireless setup the printer asked for the network password, by which it apparently meant the 64-character passphrase needed by a laptop to log into my network. I estimate it would have taken a good 15-20 minutes to enter that many characters by up/down/left/right arrows on the display.  Epson writes about using a temporary USB connection to avoid that delay.  I highly recommend just hardwiring the printer, so no passphrase is required.<br /><br />My particular software experience was unpleasant.  I spent hours trying things before calling tech support. Your experience may be better.  Epson tech support on a Friday afternoon was available after a couple of minutes wait; I was transferred twice to get to the appropriate specialist, who I considered to be highly competent and knowledgeable about the locations of files and registry entries.  She was patient and probably spent an hour with me attempting to resolve my problems before confessing she had never seen my persistent problem before.  Since my primary computer was fully functional and the NX625 worked well, I gave up on the secondary computer for the time being.<br /><br />I give the printer great marks for connection flexibility, quality output, tech support availability and low cost for light home use.  I downgrade it for unresolved software issues, in my case.;;4.0;;April 2, 2011;;13;;13;;1.0

Outrageous price of cartridges;;The HP 7510 printer is really quite nice.  The AirPrint and ePrint features are really handy and relatively easy to use.  The printer set-up (2 Apple computers and 2 Windows computers) was somewhat difficult.  The Apple computers had to go through the Internet to get the software/drivers (don't use the discs that came with the computer).... follow the instructions sheet.  One of the Windows computers (running Windows 7) was set-up with the included set-up disc, but the older Windows computer (running Vista) could not successfully load the driver/software.  Rather than deal with Vista problems/issues, I chose to just not load the printer drivers/software on the older machine (maybe I'll get to it in the near future.... but the older machine is not used much and I have a Brother laser printer that the machine can access.<br /><br />The photo output from the printer is amazing.  The operation is relatively quiet, with typical hums and noises, but not annoying.<br /><br />The only downside is the cost of replacement ink cartridges.  A complete set of 5 XL cartridges will run just under $100.  OUTRAGEOUS!  But, the colors and print quality is really very good.  An alternative is to buy/use remanufactured or compatible cartridges, but you will need to give up the printer's ability to monitor ink levels.<br /><br />All in all, the printer is a good value at the $141 i paid for it, but the cost of ink will quickly overwhelm the reasonable acquisition cost of the printer, I think.;;5.0;;November 23, 2011;;50;;50;;1.0

By reading and following the instructions it all went off without a hitch.  Since the initial setup was to my desktop (and it connected wirelessly without a problem) I had to go to the hp web site and download the driver to my notebook (no CD drive in the notebook).  Even that was easy and I was able to add the new printer to the notebook and have it speak wirelessly to the printer.  I believe that people who have problems with installation fail to read and follow instructions (which are very, very clear).<br />Now it will be interesting to see if the ink management is better then my old HP Deskjet (where the last color cartridge lasted all of 10 pages before giving up and at $36+ a cartridge it prompted me to retire the 10 year old printer and get this new one.) For the purchase price of $58 I don't see how this could be better.;;5.0;;May 18, 2011;;6;;6;;1.0

I have owned this printer for over two years, just recently buying another one on Amazon to replace the old one. It's used in a very busy home office, with little or no regard for its well being(it's abused by four people daily ;-) ) To it's credit, the 1600W holds its own, with no paper jams and a nice output for color and B&W prints that belies its low price.<br /><br />The only real problem is that supplies like toner are very expensive if you go the O.E.M. route...something we avoid at all costs. Refill toner is readily available and we use it exclusively. Also remember to never use lower than 24lb. paper to avoid jams, and never, ever use media meant for an inkjet...it even warns against this right on the media input tray...heed it if you want to see your 1600W last more than a few weeks.<br /><br />All told, the 1600W has far exceeded all of our expectations for the price paid, its built like a tank(mostly metal, not plastic,hence the 35000 page monthly duty cycle). If you need office quality prints with little or no problems, this is your printer :-);;4.0;;February 6, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

So far, I love it.  It wakes up quickly, prints quickly, and set up was easy.  I've only printed and copied, so I can't speak for the scanner or fax yet.<br /><br />I compaired a monochrome print with one from my Canon Pixma (not a laser - it's the one I usually use to print in color) and the Pixma was richer, but I haven't experimented with any of the print settings yet.<br /><br />I was originally looking for a color laser printer, and ultimately decided to use my Cannon Pixma for color (since I rarely print in color)and get a monochrome laser (which is more cost effective for printing).  In researching printers, I found that the majority of color lasers use up color even if you print in monochrome, and they require replacing the color cartridges even if you are trying to print in monochrome.<br /><br />All I can do is compare it to the laser printer I had (Brother) and I would say I'm way happier with this printer than I ever was with the Brother (it's faster, quieter, and "wakes up" quicker - plus, my lights don't dim when I use it!).<br /><br />I'm using it as a "network" printer and have one desktop and 4 laptops using it as a default.  So far, so good.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving it a "5" is because I haven't had it long enough and haven't tried all the functions yet.<br /><br />The only negative input I have is that the quick set up neglects to illustrate that you have to remove the orange ring from the toner/drum cartridge.  I kept getting a "reset toner" message and finally figured out what the problem was (the orange ring is attached to a ribbon which has to be removed before use).;;4.0;;October 28, 2010;;7;;7;;1.0

The installation was very easy. The hardest part was finding the serial number which is well-hidden inside next to the print cartridges (with no hints as to its location as far as I could tell, thank goodness for Google).<br /><br />I've switched to Canon printers after frustrating experience with HP.  My old Canon gave out after about 4 years. Since that is better than my past experience and I have a second Canon that is still working fine, I bought another Canon.<br /><br />Ink is expensive but I don't think any worse than for other printers. I have had reasonable experience with non-Canon cartridges.  The good thing is that it has separate cartridges for each color so at least you don't waste any ink. The bad is that the cartridges seem smaller than my old printer's. That's why it got 4 stars, not 5.<br /><br />The scanning software is easy to use and does everything I want it to.<br /><br />It has wireless capabilities but I don't use them so I can't say how well it works.<br /><br />The printer/copier/scanner does everything I need it to very well.;;4.0;;June 19, 2012;;15;;15;;1.0

Something is wrong with the fuser/toner cartridges and despite me getting a local printer/copier technician to look at it, he thinks it can't be fixed. Not wanting to spend any more money trying to get it repaired, I'm just holding onto it until the toner runs out.<br /><br />But recently, my my wife is planning on going back to college. Back to college means writing papers, printing out stuff, and all that jazz and she needed a printer that didn't have a huge streak going down each sheet. On top of that, she wanted a printer that was capable of copying/scanning. Having procrastinated for a while now, I did notice that another Canon Pixma (PIXMA MG6220) was the Gold Box Deal of the Day. That printer retailed $199.99 but was on sale for $59.99. Instead of pulling the trigger on it, I decided to wait until she woke up. Unfortunately, that printer sold out lightning fast. When I checked back, some kind of Toshiba laptop was the replacement product. She was upset, but told me to keep an eye out for another deal. Luckily, I checked Amazon that night and saw this printer (PIXMA MG5320) replaced that Toshiba laptop. The only difference is that it was the model down and was $2 cheaper. Not willing to lose out on it, I pulled the trigger.<br /><br />[ COMPARISONS ]<br />Comparing the whitepaper documents on the MG5320 vs the MG6220 I lost out on earlier that day, they seem to do the EXACT same thing (print speeds, DPI, duplex printing, etc) with the exception of 4 things:<br />1) 5 individual inks vs 6 individual inks (the MG6220 has the gray cartridge)<br />2) a non-touch screen vs touch screen (big whoop)<br />3) No Ethernet (WiFi Only) vs Ethernet + WiFi (oh no)<br />4) No Google Cloud Print Ready vs Google Cloud Print Ready (I have easily bypassed this to make it available on my printer).<br /><br />So for 3 out of 4 functions missing, was it worth $2 (gold box price difference)? Yes. Is it worth $50 price difference (if you bought it retail)? Probably not.<br /><br />[ SETUP ]<br />From unboxing to setup completion, it took me about 35 minutes. That setup includes removing all the tape/wrapping, putting in the ink cartridges in, powering it on, connecting it to my PC via USB, and then running the calibration steps required before actual printing. Since I connected it via USB, I have Windows 7 and it automatically recognized the printer and set it up for me. Of course, my wife likes having those diagnostic tools/software that comes with printers, so I installed that on my computer. I will say it's not as bad as past software/tools from previous printers I owned (Lexmark & HP). It's less bulky and the software is less intrusive. It's less "bloatware" than other bloatware drivers that usually accompany printers.<br /><br />As long as you have Wifi in your home, setting it up is a breeze. All you need to know is your wifi network's SSID and the password. That's it. Type those in correctly and it will join your network and allows you to utilize Google Cloud Printing, Airprinting, printing over the network.<br /><br />[ PRINTING ]<br />In terms of printing you have the option of regular paper (on the bottom tray) or photo paper (on the top tray). There is a CD tray for printing onto CD/DVDs/etc (you must have a printable CD-R/DVD-R). So as long as you buy those disc, you never have to buy one of those label stickers.<br /><br />Printing on plain paper (I just use generic copier paper for my HP Laserjet) is as good as printing with an inkjet gets. If you're wanting crisper text, you need to invest in paper that doesn't bleed as much. Remember, I'm going from a laser printer (which fuses toner) to an inkjet that sprays ink onto paper. Obviously my Laserjet looks crisper, but I can fix that by getting higher quality paper.<br /><br />Photo printing is awesome. With the printer came a sample pack of about 10 4 x 6 sheets. If you're wondering what it is specifically, it is the Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy II, 4 x 6 Inches, 100 Sheets (2311B023). Having printed photos dozens of times at CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart, the quality of the photos are as good as ones you get professionally done. HOWEVER, there are a few things I need to point out.<br />1. This printer is a 9600 maximum dpi printer. The higher the dpi when you print photos on photo quality paper, the higher the detail.<br />2. When you print photos, you need EXCELLENT quality photos AKA straight from the digital camera or high megapixel camera. My wife tried to print a couple photos she pulled from Facebook. They looked absolutely horrible due to the compression that Facebook does by default unless you check the option to upload in high resolution. This option is *ONLY* available on Facebook's webpage. The mobile versions do not allow you to do this. Because of that, the majority of floating facebook photos out there are not in high quality. Again, the artifacts (square blocks, uneven colors/detail) from compression (like the photos on facebook) will be very very visible when you print on high resolution and/or photo paper.<br /><br />Other printing features (such as templates) are bundled in the application (on the setup CD) and also on built into the printer itself. Such templates include the following: calendars, photo albums, lined papers (such as notebook paper, graph paper, checklist paper, agendas, etc).<br /><br />[ OTHER FEATURES ]<br />Google Cloud Print - This is fairly a new technology and even myself, a frequent user of Google technologies, rarely use this. I just don't see it as useful to print to my home printer when I'm not home unless I really needed something printed. Regardless, this model printer says it doesn't support Google Cloud Print, but there are ways around it if you set it up on your Google account. Of course by doing that, you have to leave your PC on and always connected to the Internet.<br /><br />Apple Airprint - Having 2 iPhones and an iPad in the house, printing from the Apple devices makes printing more accessible. Because this printer supports Airprint, it automatically shows up on your Apple devices as long as you set up the PIXMA printer on your local home network AND your Apple devices are on the same network.<br /><br />[ COPYING / SCANNING ]<br />Scanning is pretty good. We scanned a couple photographs just to test and it seemed to be good quality. It's really easy.<br />Copying is a snap. You put the document on the scanner, close the lid, and then press to either copy in black or color. Not much easier than that.<br /><br />[ IMPORTANT NEED-TO-KNOWS TO SAVE INK ]<br />Not sure if they were engineered this way (I've seen other Canon printers in the past do this), but by default, regardless of if you print in black only (say a report for school), black colors come from mixing your color cartidges together. So when you read reviews that this is an INK HOG, it's because those reviewers don't know how to set up the printer. Actually I blame this with Canon, because the average consumer would not realize this. To remove it, it's a hassle, but it's a major step if you want to save $$$ on ink. I will attempt to put the link directly here BUT, Amazon removes external links. The link is here: [...]<br />If this is the case, then just go to Canon's website. Look for the PIXMA printer and then go to Support. Type in "black" in the support search box and the document you want to look for is "Print using black ink only". Long story short, to turn it off, it's a combination of two settings:<br />1. Media Type must ALWAYS be Plain Paper. Otherwise you'll use up all your colors to make up black.<br />2. Grayscale Printing must be enabled.<br />That's it.<br /><br />Lastly, I would suggest you not turn this printer off and NOT use the power save feature. When you do, it goes through the standard cycle of cleaning the heads and prepping the printer for print. EVERYTIME the printer does this, it wastes a little bit of ink. So you have to ask your self, do you want to save on electricity or do you want to save on ink (remember ink is about $45 - $50 a pack unless you want to buy them individually for $13 - $14 each). Of course there are 3rd party ink cartridges, but I haven't blown through my original set yet, so time will tell.;;5.0;;August 23, 2012;;16;;16;;1.0

In my past experience with Brother printers and fax machines they are extremely reliable and easy to setup and that is why I chose to go with a Brother. With a infrequently used copier the inkjet versions will clog and as the ink dries out in the print heads and they are a lot slower and in the long run a lot more expensive with the cost of consumables.<br /><br />Setup was fast and easy and the Nuance scanner software is great and an improvement over that provided with older models from Brother and the software from HP which is so bloated that it often fails to even install properly.<br /><br />Nice feature is the ability to register a PC by name when installing the software. Then when scanning a document you can select the destination computer from the Brother and push the scan to the desired PC. Very easy and very slick implementation and it works!<br /><br />Nuance software also provides for scanning to the customary TIFF or JPEG formats but by default will scan and output a PDF file which is a real timesaver for scanning a document to email to someone. I would pay for the free Nuance software for this feature alone.<br /><br />Printing to the Brother MFC7360N wakes it out of sleep mode (actuall "deep sleep") and outputs a page in seconds. It is roughly four times as fast as my HP 4000TN printer to output the first page. The Brother does suck up a lot of power when it comes out of sleep mode and the alarm goes off on the UPS that is on the same circuit. I suspect it probably should be on its own circuit or a 20amp circuit to avoid any problems with other devices.<br /><br />Scanning is very fast and with standard large images works as expected. With text pages though the borders have a shadow pattern on the page on both sides that is generated within the machine. For OCR or most images this is not going to be a problem but not great for making scans of text pages for electronic archival purposes. This problem only affects scans and does not happen when making a copy of the same printed page so it may be a problem with the Nuance software.<br /><br />It also is extremely noisy with a loud hum and loud fan noise when it is first turned on or after a page is printed. It goes into standard and then sleep and then deep sleep mode and the fan does not shut off until it reaches "deep sleep". The MFC really needs to be in a separate room with a door you can close. Turning the unit on and not even printing or scanning it goes into standard mode and I timed how long it took for the fan to shut off. It takes a full 11 minutes before the machine goes into deep sleep mode and its very loud fan shuts off. Has to be a defect in the design as the cooling fan cycles even when the MFC7360N is first turned on and nothing has been printed. This could be fixed with a firmware upgrade but apparently Brother has not bothered to produce one.<br /><br />I paid $179.97 for this printer on August 24, 2011 and a week later it is priced at $114.99 which, if you can put it in a separate room, makes this a good value with the low cost of the Brother consumables.<br /><br />The noise is loud and atypical of laser printers. Most recently I bought a Canon 4570dn all in one and after it prints a page it shuts down immediately and it is completely silent. The 11 minutes of fan noise from the majority of Brother laserjet printers is a fairly recent defect as I have had other laserjet printers from Brother that did not exhibit this behavior and were extremely reliable.;;2.0;;August 26, 2011;;157;;166;;0.945783

I most frequently print 2-4 page items in color. Mostly mapping/directions, short legal documents, faxes, and forms. I've printed a couple digital photos, but they were taken from compact digital cameras where expectations are moderate. The output on all these items has been great.<br /><br />The printer works well and takes up very little space. I use it with a few different laptops, and I used to plug it directly into each one. When plugged directly into a computer the desktop software has a nice ink and paper management tool which alerts you to any important conditions and the ink-level.<br /><br />I recently attached it to a Netgear wireless 4-port switch and usb print server. This is a nice way to get remote printing from a bunch of computers without leaving any of them on. However, I've yet to get the nice Canon ink/paper status monitor to work with the netgear print server. I turned on bi-directional support on the netgear LPT device, and that's not enough. If you decide to use a device like this, keep in mind you might loose this printer-status feature in the process.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Canon iP90.

I've even spent time with tech support (useless). It is setup wirelessly now but it sometimes will drop it and the ONLY way to recover it is to reboot the printer. Very annoying trying to print something upstairs, getting an error message, then going up to restart it, then back down again to print once more.<br /><br />I successfully scanned with it a few weeks ago but this morning cannot. First I was able to preview only but got some meaningless error on the actual scan. Restartig printer didn't help. Restarting my computer did (?). Except then when the scan came up it had randomly chosen some tiny area of the picture to actually scan, ignoring the rest (right in the middle).<br /><br />Ink is cheap but the start-up costs on these printers are fairly high so the payback isn't as obvious as you may think. I suspect, but can't confirm, that color ink doesn't work very long.<br /><br />I'm regretting not bringing this back and going with another printer, mainly because of the very, very finicky wireless. I've never had any other problems on any wireless device in my house (many).<br /><br />EDIT: I am now giving this just 1/5 and wish I had returned it. The wi-fi deciding to go to sleep and only being recoverable by physically rebooting the printer is completely unacceptable. Further, the scanner does not work wirelessly well at all. Sometimes it will preview fine but not scan, other times it will. The error on-screen is completely meaningless and not even always the same one. The scanner DOES work well with a thumb drive plugged into the printer, and its copying feature is handy but the software for this printer is not ready for prime-time and the WI-FI failures with this trump all other functionality. wi-fi printing does work well, and consistently--as long as the wi-fi link of the printer hasn't died. It's like they got 90% of the way there with this printer then just rushed it to market, and that 10% is too bothersome to be forgiven. This is the kind of annoyance that encourages a person to avoid a particular brand.<br /><br />EDIT 2/1/2012. Unbelievable. First, I've actually gotten wireless working better. Its range is just really poor, since I put it much closer to the router it's been doing better. But, no more stars for you 9250 and here's why:<br /><br />1) Your scanner is very, very slow. I put in a blank thumb drive--no files--and the time it takes to get the thing ready to scan is just ridiculously long. It also scans images at a snail's pace.<br />2) This one blows my mind, I mean makes me question my sanity. Today I am printing--trying to print. I have a fresh black cartridge, but the color is completely run out. No problem, right? I don't want to print color, just black and white. They are separate cartridges after all. All other printers since the dawn of time when printers were made out of clay and wood in the 15th century have allowed us to print in black and white when color is dead, but this one? Nope. Now it's *refusing* to print even in black and white, even when I specifically say to print only in black and white (I am not trying to force a color image through at all), until I replace the color cartridge. I'm sitting here dead in the water until I go out and buy a color cartridge to print a 100% black image. Thanks, Kodak 9250.<br /><br />EDIT 8/20/2012. Again today after replacing the color cartridge back in February I got the refusal of the printer to print in black without putting in a new color cartridge. Trust me, I'm telling it unequivocally via print dialogue to print in black, but no it insists on me replacing the low color ink cartridge. I print in essentially nothing in color, so what we have here is the cartridge basically "drying out" (use that term loosely as I could still dab off tons of ink on my fingers when replacing it--I suspect the printer has a timer function to "decay" the cartridge after a while) every ~6 months, so $40/year even if I don't print in color.;;1.0;;June 28, 2011;;13;;14;;0.928571

Seemed like a good deal, the wireless feature sounded great, and our other printer was getting outdated.  Got it home, set it up, printed from my Windows desktop and it worked great.  Tried to set it up on my new MacBook, which the printer came with mind you, and there were no drivers for OSX Lion.  None.  HP even acknowledged that they didn't support Lion at the time.  Why would a printer be bundled with a computer that won't support it?  Also, when HP finally released drivers for Lion, the download was over 500 mb.  500 mb for printer drivers?  Not to mention it STILL doesn't work in Lion, whether wireless or wired.<br /><br />So now we've resorted to printing everything from one of our Windows machines, which is still hit or miss.  The wireless function doesn't work at all, even though the printer is online and I can ping it.  Now, even when plugging in to USB the printer is unresponsive when a print job is sent to it.  I've tried all manners of resetting the printer, uninstalling and reinstalling drivers, turning off energy-saver mode, etc; nothing.  Every now and then it will randomly print a document on the first try, but for the most part it just sits unresponsive.<br /><br />Not to mention some of the other problems like the fact that printed pages get shot across the desk onto the floor, it uses ink very fast, and it spends more time running the motors and cartridge than actually printing.<br /><br />To sum it up, I absolutely despise this printer.  I would rather go back to my old dot-matrix printer than use this.  Even if you can get this for free as a promotion I wouldn't recommend it, pay the extra money for a better printer (probably from Epson or Canon).<br /><br />To HP: If you have a representative reading reviews on here, I really hope your next line of printers is more reliable than this.<br /><br />***UPDATE 1/4/2012***<br />In this review I failed to address the issue of ink usage.  The initial cartridges were used quickly, which is typical with shipped cartridges.  As a replacement we purchased the standard HP 564 Black cartridge, installation was easy, but we printed about 60 pages of text on "fast draft" and the black cartridge was empty (note the cartridge packaging lists it is good for 250 pages).  After this we tried out the 564XL cartridge, and after printing about 80 pages of text on "fast draft" it is also out of ink.  The "XL" states that it is capable of 3x the pages of the regular, so 750 pages.  750 pages of what, 1 word on each page?  I actually had a situation where I had to dig out my old printer and use it to print one page since the B210 wasn't capable.  HP, you have officially lost all business from my household in the future.<br /><br />At least the scan feature is reliable on this printer.  If you need a good, oversized scanner, this is the one for you!;;1.0;;November 29, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

The printer makes excellent images.  The machine is fast from the time you click on print to when the page starts printing, and the printing is fast.  This is the highlight of the machine.  Two sided copying is excellent.  The automatic document feature works well for copy and fax, but the scannning software is a problem.<br /><br />The first machine I got had a defective fax board, but the store I bought it from let me return it for a new unit.  Setup of the machine worked well.  You can configure it using a built in web server.  You might have trouble finding the machine on the nework, though.  Unfortunately it does not respond to ping broadcast packets.  You can go to the front panel and go through the menus to print a network report to see what IP address it selected.  From there the web access works best to set up the machine.  Setting a manual IP address is easy enough from the front panel so you know what IP address to connect to.  You can get an optional second paper tray.<br /><br />While setup of the machine via the web access works well it is limited in that the fax cannot be set up through the web interface.  This is unfortunate, since the fax settings are tedious to enter from the front panel.  You can use the web interface for the address book, but setting fax settings like address, speed, report settings, and everything else are not changeable except through the front panel.<br /><br />As far as scanning goes, this is not a push scan device.  (A push scan device is one where the scanner does the scan, then transfers to another computer by a network protocol like FTP or SMB).  There is a button on the machine to scan, but that just starts up the program you have to install on your computer.  The HP scan software is difficult to use and unintuitive.  Definitely NOT production environment.  It is also bloatwear.  Over a thousand files get installed on the computer that serves as the scanning control computer.  Also, whenever you scan the document comes out at 17 inches on the computer.  The workaround in my setting is to fax to our fax server, which takes the calls and keeps the faxes. In this way I have a push scan option at the cost of a phone call for each scan.  But if you have a business you do not want to use this as the document scanner using the HP softwear.  I do not know if VueScan works with this device.<br /><br />If you just need a postscript printer then this will work out of the box.  For the advanced features that the printer supports you need to install the postscript driver.  It may be possible to install the postscript driver without the scan softwear, which would be best if you have several computers that need to use the printer.  I specifically did not install the scan softwear at the satellite location where I use the printer and it works fine as a generic postscript printer.  (I installed the bloated HP scanning softwear at the main office where I did the initial configuration)<br /><br />The printer is the same engine as in the HP LaserJet P2015dn Printer (HP LaserJet P2015dn Printer (CB368A#ABA)).  Review there are good for understanding more about the printing function.  The cartridge, an HP 53, is shared between this multifunction device and the P2015dn.  In a small office having the same cartridge used by different printers simplifies inventory issues.<br /><br />So, for home use and occasional scanning this is a nice machine, fast to print with very high quality printing.  For an office environment it is good as a printer and copier, but the scanning software would choke anyone who needed to do document scanning as part of the business workflow.;;3.0;;February 17, 2008;;75;;76;;0.986842

I also owned the Brother 2800.  This is the new and revised version of the 2800.  Apparently Brother does improve upon their faults.  You can see my review on the 2800 and the downfalls.  For a re-cap:<br /><br />1. 2800 had paper jams when using old paper.  The 2820 has a paper feeder like their printers which greatly reduces jams.  (I also own brothers laser printer) Now I can use recycled (one-side already printed) paper and not have to deal with jams.  Also 2820 holds much more paper in its tray, so you wont have to worry about running out.<br /><br />2. 2820 has a new feed system which reduces jams when faxing out.  I had problems faxing 20+ pages with the 2800, now none with 2820.  However they say there is a limit to 20 pages (just add more pages as they feed through).<br /><br />3. The only downfall is the toner is slightly more expensive.  It does print more pages, but does cost a bit more.  Fax machine is more expensive also.<br /><br />Overall, if you don't want to deal with the 2800 problems then pay the extra money for the 2820 and feel confident with its performance.  If money is an issue, get the 2800.  Personally the few extra bucks is worth it over aggravation when trying to fax/receive.<br /><br />Another added bonus feature:  This fax can also connect to the computer through USB allowing to work as a printer.  I currently have this set-up and works very well.  Have no issues priting with this fax machine.  Great feature if you don't want to buy a printer.  (2800 does not have this feature);;5.0;;November 3, 2005;;175;;179;;0.977654

I read lots of reviews to make sure I chose a good performing laser model and this one did a fine job in the one month I owned it.  But it has one odd quirk that no one seemed to mention: it makes periodic clunking noises when idle.<br /><br />About once every 2-3 hours the machine will forward its drum roller just a bit to prevent it from staying in contact with heated parts for too long.  Perhaps not a big deal if you have the machine way down the hall, but the split-second clunking noise was loud enough to wake me up in the adjacent room several times each night.  And I didn't enjoy sitting next to it all day either.<br /><br />The only way to avoid this problem is to turn off the computer between uses - which really isn't very practical because the power switch is way down low on the backside and hard to reach if the printer is inside a cabinet or against the wall (like most usually are).  Incredibly dumb switch design.<br /><br />Took me several rounds with Lexmark online to uncover the source of the mystery clunking.  Turns out this is a common feature on recent Lexmark lasers.  They were reasonably helpful and offered to refund my money since the store's return period had expired, but the entire process took a lot of persistence on my part - more than some people would tolerate.  I bought a Brother 5340D instead which cost less but has about the same print quality and features.;;4.0;;February 16, 2011;;5;;6;;0.833333

VERY nice color output. But bring a hammock for larger files! I printed a 7 MB and 16MB pdf file. It was only 2 pages in length: color pictures with text. It took 4 minutes to print one page (with Duplex) and another 2 minutes to print a second copy. Yikes! Considering it comes with 128MB ram, what's the problem? It's the processor.

It was also important that the printer would work on Mac, Linux and Windows platform. This printer was what floated to the top. The built-in NIC is very useful - just plugin the power cord, a network cable and turn it on - on either the Mac or Windows 7, the printer is detected as a network printer automatically when adding a new printer. No drivers needed. Truly plug and play on both the Mac and Windows.<br /><br />The unit itself is very quiet when in its power saving mode, with the only indication that its on being a blue light on the front panel. While printing, the unit is certainly louder - but still enough to maintain a conversation at a reasonable level. I haven't truly tested to see if I can get 5 ppm colour or 20ppm B/W, but I have noticed that from power-up to print it takes about 15-30 seconds and less than 10 seconds from sleep; neither numbers being an issue for me. Its a small unit that tucks away in a corner of the room nicely, and its tray takes a full stack of office paper. The one thing that would make this fantastic would be a duplexer unit. This is sold as an option for this model, however, the price nearly doubles.<br /><br />To address some of the previous reviews, where Konica-Minolta stopped supporting the printer by no longer providing printer driver updates, I should say that for this particular printer, configured as a network printer through the LAN port, I can't see this being a problem. Both on the Mac system as well as on Windows 7, the printer is recognised as a Postscript printer, meaning that the drivers are Windows' generic built-in. I have never been a fan of using a vendor's own print driver since they tend to add a lot of cruft and little value (having not installed the vendor driver I wouldn't know if this is the case here), but I for one am hard pressed to see what difference the vendor driver provides over the PS one, and am of the mindset that there is none. So I don't think planned obsolescence on KM's part might not hit the 1650EN quite so hard. Just some food for thought...<br /><br />In short, for under $200, you will have trouble finding a laser printer with this economy, durability and a network connection.;;5.0;;July 1, 2010;;11;;11;;1.0

This means that you print the even numbered pages, then remove the stack and place it back into the tray. At this point, you are supposed to press a "continue" button in a dialogue box that pops up on your screen. The problem is that if you attempt to do any work in another window, then that dialogue box disappears and you cannot press the continue button. There is no way to get it to reappear that I am aware of. It just disappears and you are left with a stack of even-numbered pages. The dialogue box will also disappear whether you do anything or not if the printer is on standby when you send the print job. So, if you want to print double-sided, make sure to turn it on (not standby) first. Otherwise, you'll again have a stack of even-numbered pages.;;4.0;;July 10, 2010;;109;;111;;0.981982

I bought this P2035N on 8/9/2010 because of its speed, and it is quick.<br /><br />The major (and unforgivable) drawback is the cost and lifespan of the consumable ink cartridge (the P2035N only uses the HP 05A cartridge, and NOT the HP 05X high capacity cartridge).  The HP 05A cartridge costs about $90, and is rated at 2,300 pages (about 4 cents per page).  The first new cartridge lasted thirty days.  The second one only lasted twenty days.  The HP 05X (high capacity) cartridge costs about $165 and is rated at 6,500 pages (2.5 cents per page); however, the P2035N printer cannot use the 05X cartridge.<br /><br />By comparison, my former HP P2015d printer could use the HP 53X (extended use) cartridge (costs $165, rated at 7,000 pages), which means that it costs about 2.4 cents per page, and it would last me about 3 months.  Even the HP 53A cartridge (costs $90, rated at 3,000 pages) costs about 3 cents per page.<br /><br />Based on the above experience, here is my bottom line:  Don't buy this printer.  To print 2,300 pages per month costs about $90 on the P2035n, but would only cost about $57 if it could use the high capacity 05X cartridge.  That means it costs me almost $400 more per year (which is $100 more than I paid for the printer itself).  I've thought about just buying the HP 2055n, because it's just as fast and it can use the 05X cartridge; but I hear reports that the P2055n is horribly slow at printing PDF documents (and I now scan all of my files into PDF formats).;;1.0;;October 16, 2010;;28;;30;;0.933333

I still can't believe it was so easy.  Believe me, I'm usually close to tears doing things like this.<br /><br />I used all the photo paper that came with the printer and the pictures are fabulous.  A flower with a butterfly is just beautiful, pictures of our granddaughter are better than from the store.  I intend to use that paper from now on, so they were smart to include it.  I also used some photo paper that I've had around for a long time and it did not do as well.<br /><br />Being able to handle the pictures afterwards without worrying about smudges is huge for me.  With the old printer I would have to leave them out at least overnight before I felt I could stack them together.  In fact I rarely printed pictures with the old printer because things would go wrong and I felt I was wasting ink and paper.<br /><br />This printer is much smaller than the old one.

Well, I ordered this, not realizing it was a printer only.  So if you want an all-in-one, make sure you double check.  OfficeJet is now the same as a deskjet/inkjet, and deskjet is now a multipurpose machine.  Go figure.<br /><br />With that said, if you are looking for a printer only machine, this is a good one.  It was easy to setup, although you have to be sure to follow the installation steps.  The machine is quiet, although you must place it on a sturdy table or desk.

This is a major problem with this printer.  For this reason alone, I'd have to say not to buy it.<br /><br />The paper holder is also small, so only about a quarter ream can be put into it.  Paper seems to jam more frequently than on other printers I've worked with.<br /><br />Another major drawback for me is that there is no separate bypass for envelopes.  The standard paper has to be removed and the guides realigned to print a standard mailing envelope.

Then all hell broke loose...pages were printed with heavy black lines instead of type, and it reset the right margin to half a page. Print speed is supposed to be 30 pages but It's more like 4-5 pages a minute. Also, the paper tray doesn't hold much paper- about 40 sheets (at most) and not the 100 sheets as specified in the manual. It scans well and the fax function works.<br /><br />Tech support was terrible. The person I spoke to was not knowledgeable and insisted that the margin problem was with the Word document. She kept suggesting that I reset the document margins to make it come out right. In fact, she asked me to define what I meant by margins! I did a test print on our other printer and the output was perfect. I turned off the Kodak overnight. It seems that the next day the printer magically repaired itself and the problems are now gone. I still wish that the print speed were faster and that the tray held more paper.<br /><br />Would I recommend this printer? I have mixed feelings. Its features and performance are not consistent with its specifications. I would shop around. Like most electronics today, this was manufactured in China. The tradeoff of lower prices for quality isn't worth it. I would be willing to pay more for goods made in America. At least they are reliable and can be repaired.

When I was printer hunting, I thought about purchasing a newer HP printer. What I have been noticing is that prices for ink and how greedily the printers use them have both been increasing. The newer HP printers also "feel" cheaply constructed compared to the HP of old. I was looking for a printer that was more judicious with my valuable printer ink. Two additional features that I was looking to get were wireless printing (no more cords) and duplexing (save on paper). All of this and more was found in the Canon PIXMA MG5220.<br /><br />Pros<br />All-In-One unit does everything - It does fairly well at each task. Prints very nicely, moderate on the ink (ink price is reasonable), scans well.<br />Duplex - A feature that is found on more expensive printers finally comes to a more Home/Small Office unit.<br />Paper Tray - A dedicated actual tray vs the "lower flap and load the paper in the bottom" that cheaper printers have. It's small in capacity, but a nice feature to have.<br />Wireless - No more cables! Setup took me all of 5-10 minutes, the longest part being entering my wireless password into the device one letter at a time via the scroll wheel.<br />Style - It's piano black, which is all the rage lately. Looks nice...for now.<br /><br />Cons<br />Print speed - It has a fairly low PPM rate compared to other printers. Those who are looking to print lots of documents or are on a time constraint might feel that the printer moves too slow.<br />Initial Assembly - My unit chose to be finicky in bringing the print head where it needed to be to assemble. Eventually, after powering it off a couple of times and resetting it back to the initial setup it decided to work properly. There is a myriad of tape and paper that covers parts that you probably won't even touch. Instructions are adequate, but having my unit cooperate on the first power on was somewhat confusing and frustrating; this may or may not happen to you.<br />Style - It's piano black, which is all the rage lately. Looks nice...for now. Being piano black means dust and fingerprints become more of an asthetics ritual to continue looking sharp.<br />Noise - It isn't whisper quiet. Some have mentioned the noise as an issue. This one was no louder than my old (albeit cheap) HP, and may depend on what surface you place the printer on.<br /><br />Summary<br />For the price, this printer is exceptional. It has quite a few features that usually hit the $250+ ceiling when it comes to printers. It has lived up to my expectations, which has been printing moderate amounts of documents for family use.<br /><br />No driver issues with Windows 7 64-bit. No issues connecting it to my wireless network (WPA2 security). The response time over the wireless has been very good; though each network is different, so this may vary on your particular setup.;;5.0;;December 12, 2010;;24;;24;;1.0

The last 3 printers were Epson's & each newer model did more in programs but ate more ink then the one before. The last Epson stop printing when it ran out of one color (felt like ¼ of the ink was still there) & wouldn't switch to B&W to finish a simple web site copy. I went on one of my researches & studied what was out there in the current market. What did I find? HORROR stories! A few happy campers but if they like the printer they complained about the ink prices or usage. I also became a victim of: "I bought 3 Epson's & I am not buying another one". I was a professional photographer & loved my old 35mm Cannon cameras so therefore I looked at today's current Cannon printers but they come with only 1 single color ink cartridge with 3 tones inside. What happens if one color runs out, do you have to buy a whole new color cartridge??? Brothers make good B&W office printers, but how is their color or their print quality? Let's check out HP printers, but those on sell at SAMs & COSCO rated low in Amazon.com. No wonder SAMs & COSCO sell printers so cheap. We went to Office Max & this HP model 7520 had the best pixels & features per price. Cross my fingers.<br /><br />I found the product well package with easy instructions & got the printer put together & running without the download within a 1/2 hour. I started running into problems when down loading the HP CD into the main computer:<br /><br />1. The CD download program gives you 2 options: download straight from the CD or CD with the web. I went with the 2nd option because it promised extras but the program stalled. I then turned off the web & went back to the CD, took about 15 minutes to download with no problems.<br /><br />2. After the CD finished the program it told me to go to the printer & follow the instructions on the screen. The program found my "Wi-Fi" but not my password. Found my password, but the printer wasn't picking up the signal & gave me a big list of things to check. FORGET IT, I attached the USB cord from the computer to the printer & the printer was up & running. I will e-mail myself from our I-Pad to the main computer & then print to the printer.<br /><br />Printing mostly information from web pages on plain paper & the print quality is very good. Haven't tried any photos on photo paper as yet.<br /><br />Ratings of "4" for the 2 download problems.;;4.0;;October 3, 2012;;9;;11;;0.818182

The toner gives far fewer prints, however there's no drum unit to replace.  The brother would deliver 2,000 prints on a $50 toner while the HP delivers 1,500 prints on a $55 toner.  Take the cost of a drum and 5 cartridges every 10,000 prints on the Brother and the price is about the same.  HP costs about 3.6 cents per page to operate and the Brother costs 3.5 cents based on my experience. The HP jams less and is much more crisp and clear.  Go with the HP every time.<br /><br />For those who complain about 1,500 pages being a small load or about a $100 printer running slower than a $1,000 printer, I suggest working with more printers on the low end before making your comparisons.  This is a good unit.  I will be buying more for the office.  Each workstation here prints about 10,000 pages per year.;;4.0;;July 8, 2008;;7;;7;;1.0

I am an old geezer, so time is pretty valuable to me, and this printer takes way too long to finally decide it is going to begin printing.

My replacement cartridges came directly from Epson's on-line store.  Yesterday I changed a cartridge and received an error message, "Ink cartridges cannot be recognized".<br /><br />I tried to fix the problem by turning the printer off and on.  I then tried to joggle the cartridge.  Failing to do any good, I made a web search on the error message + Epson and was amazed to find that this has been a problem with Epson printers for years. To date, neither the Epson site or the general web lists a decent fix.  Many posts refer to the Epson help desk "advice" that off-brand cartridges are the issue, and that genuine Epson cartridges are the fix.  I used only Epson cartridges from the Epson on-line store.  Unfortunately, Epson and the web have no other suggestions to get my printer going again. It appears that Epson is blaming everyone but themselves for the problem.  Maybe the bulk of the problems are associated with off-brand cartridges, but that is no excuse for not investigating the problems that the rest of us are having and providing us with a fix.<br /><br />It is amazing to me that a multi-year Epson problem remains unfixed on this newly released printer.;;1.0;;August 29, 2008;;44;;50;;0.88

But to keep from beating a dead horse about how awesome it is, I'll just write a how-to for the wireless setup. It's the only thing people gripe about in the non 5 star reviews.<br /><br />These are for a Mac OS X and only if you have a TYPICAL wireless router setup.<br /><br />1. You'll need to plug it into your computer via USB or Ethernet.<br />2. Install the printer drivers from the CD, and add the printer under Print & Fax in system preferences.<br />3. Go to... System Preferences -> Print & Fax -> Options and Supplies. Then click on "Show Printer Webpage"<br />4. The "website" for the printer will pop up. If it asks for a username and password, its u/n is "admin" and the p/w is "access".<br />5. At the top, click on "Network Configuration" then click on the Wireless tab.<br />6. Put these settings<br /><br />a. Communication Mode: Infrastructure Mode<br />b. Wireless Network Name: (insert your wireless network name here)<br />c. Authentication Method: WPA/WPA2-PSK<br />d. Encryption Mode: AES (very important!)<br />e. Passphrase: (your wireless password goes here)<br /><br />7. Click submit. You're done!<br />8. Unplug from your computer<br />9. Delete the printer from your printer list. This is because the one you installed assumes it's still plugged in.<br />10. Click Add Printer, and it should pop up as a wireless printer. Install.<br />11. Print away!<br /><br />While you're at the "website", you can set interesting things in Printer Settings like "auto duplex" (2-sided printing), setting the wait time before it goes into sleep mode (this doesn't mean the fans will turn off, because they're cooling) and Toner Save!<br /><br />Hope this helps anyone who was frustrated.;;5.0;;February 27, 2011;;7;;7;;1.0

I did so much testing and had to tweak what I said but now I think I like what I see!<br /><br />Ok so I bought this at Staples for 99 bucks on sale this weekend.  Sorry Amazon, I find you dont offer the best prices 50% of the time.  Setup was very easy, drivers are not as ominous nor as big as HP.  I am replacing my Officejet 7410.  For starters the 645 is much smaller...about 6" and a lot shorter.  The paper tray is a little cheap and flimsy...not to mention the paper is tricky to align but not a deal breaker.  I have my desk back not to mention it looks pretty nice on my desk.  Epson did a great job IMO on the look of this unit.<br /><br />The reason I am replacing my long running HP 7410 is the ADF.  I didnt use it much but when I did it was flaky.  As of late the ADF is completely crap, grabbing all pages instead of one and is a nightmare to get working properly.  The scanner was fair at best and the drivers were a complete PIG!  I hated the tri-color for if one color is empty the whole thing needs to be replaced...no separates! And it was thirsty!  Physically it was big and dumb looking however I think it looks far better than the current 8600 Pro Plus that HP just released...which is plain ugly and bulky looking! The 7410 also had issues with ink carts needing to be reseated and the card reader major inconsistencies.  It work enough but it had gremlins.<br /><br />Ok so back to the 645.  Let start with output and print quality.  It is superior to my old 7410...shocking I know!  This took me a few samples to really see!  At first I liked my 7410 than I printed as well as copied some photos and I could see a major difference. The 645 is far and away more vibrant!  It does get a hair over saturated and it outputs do lean towards warmer side of the spectrum but it is not flat or washed out like my HP 7410 is.  I almost took the epson back but I am glad I tested everything output wise.  I did docs with text some with graphics.  Docs the color isnt as accurate but photos...even though it leans to the warm side I really like what I see and I strongly prefer it!  I did have some early banding but via the driver (utility for alignment)and pushing thru a bunch of test images it seems to have worked its way out.  But I only got banding in PDFs...strange!<br /><br />There are a ton of setting so you can really get and tweak what you want.  Faxing, Scanning, and copying are very good.  Scanning is simply excellent!  Tons of settings, novice, pro, or in between.  Add all that to the speed of scanning and this part of the machine is so well done I couldnt be happier.  Faxing is also simply yet feature rich.  The front panel has sections for each function, faxing, copying and scanning.  It looks like a lot of stuff but I like that compared to hunting thru menus or messing with a touchscreen.  Copying is fast!  And it is decent.  Copying photos actually look quite good, magazine covers...some lose and the HP actually did a little better.  Once again copying is a rocket significantly faster than the HP...I mean a ton faster!!<br /><br />AirPrint and GoogleCloud print work well and are easy just make sure you update your firmware and set your DNS or it will not work properly.  I have printed from my iPad and my iPhone as well as just emailing direct from gmail or yahoo to the email address I setup with epson to snd to the printer.  It works very well and makes this printer a really feature rich good performer at an unbelievable price.<br /><br />It is still early to tell how long the ink will last so I am holding off to share whether I think it is a plus.  Separate ink tanks are nice and something my 7410 did not have.  Printing cost where higher on my old Officejet 7410 because of the tri-color cart.  As I mentioned there are a lot of buttons on the front but I actually like that because I dont need to hunt thru menu after menu.  I considering the HP Officejet 8600 pro plus but it was a lot bigger and 300 bucks!  Not to mention is is ugly as sin!!  So the Epson seems to fit the bill right now.  It does everything quite well.  I recommend the 645 it is compact, fast, cheap, and feature rich and the output quality is very good but not excellent.  That is why I give it a 4 out of 5.;;4.0;;February 11, 2012;;6;;6;;1.0

But with a caveat;;During the past 2 years I've gone through 2 inkjet printers. One was a Canon that could never print an entire page aligned. It took me till after my warranty was out to realized that it wasn't me, it was the printer. Sadly, the other was the HP5650, which had terrible software issues and finally started misfeeding the paper. I didn't know what I was going to do for my next printer.<br /><br />I finally came to my senses and realized that since I hardly ever use color, I should start looking at LaserJets. Much to my surprise, I found this one for less than many of the photo-capable InkJets. Unfortunately, my computer became a little fussy during setup, but after that, it's worked like a charm.<br /><br />The pages come out extremely fast, the print is crisp and dark, and it's not too loud. None of the "cajunk, cajunk" sound you get with the ink jets either. Also, the footprint is smaller than the HP inkjet I am now going to smash to bits. It's like a little chunk on my desktop instead of a big long log! What more could you ask?<br /><br />I still think HP is a cheap, crappy company for making us buy our own USB cables, and for not supplying a manual, but until Canon and Epson get up to speed on reliability, I'll stay with HP anyway.<br /><br />June 2006 addition --- YES there IS a problem with this thing curling the paper. The lasers get the paper warm and then there are 2 plastic tabs the paper passes by on its way out, and they curl the paper. Downgrade this rating a full star!! This doesn't happen on my friend's older business HP laser model!<br /><br />I ordered this from Amazon for $130 after the discount for getting their credit card, of course with free shipping.

Big mistake.  I don't do color printing, yet I get messages once or twice a month that a colored ink cartridge is about out, and you get an annoying message to Shop Canon For Ink, which pretty much sums up what this printer is all about - Canon Wants To Sell You Ink.  I go through so much ink that it is clear that Canon makes a very affordable printer, because they will make a fortune selling you ink.  How can one possibly go through so much colored ink when everything printed is in Black and White. Oh, Canon says that they use colored ink in black and white to keep their heads lubed.  I just printed off a HP printer that hadn't printed in over a year and it didn't need to be lubed.  This printer is such a guzzler ripoff that Canon knows that anyone with any sense will use compatible ink, so what does Canon do? - Canon uses chips to keep you from using OEM ink!  Think about that for a second, the only way that Canon can get you to buy their ink is to use a chip to keep competitor's ink out, because their ink is not priced competitively.  I frankly just can't stand the idea of willingly consenting to be gouged for ink, by a company that uses anti-competitive practices to force you to use it!  It will be much cheaper to just dump this printer in the garbage can, as a round or two of cartridges costs more than the printer.  Canon treats their customers like morons when they do this.  They don't even want to be subtle about the ripoff.  Just don't buy from printer companies that use chips.  They are ink companies, not printer companies. You will spend several hundreds of dollars on ink in no time at all, so you really should shop more based upon ink costs, than the cost of the printer.  This printer won't even function if it detects a competitor's ink, and I have had this printer stop printing when using Canon ink, because it thinks that it is a competitor's ink.  Unbelievably, Canon will actually disable the printer if it detects you using a competitor's ink, and this has happened to me when using Canon's own ink! Imagine, if you don't consent to be ripped off by Canon's outrageously high ink prices, they will DISABLE your printer!  What kind of a company would do that? Not a company that cares about it's customers, or a company that believes it can sell you ink because they sell a quality product at a competitive price.  Brother printers have the most affordable ink prices, and I think my love affair with Canon is over.;;1.0;;November 23, 2010;;27;;31;;0.870968

Two reasons we "invested" in this printer were the ability to print on tabloid-sized paper, and the automatic duplexing feature -- we do 4-page 11x17 newsletters. We very soon discovered that automatic duplexing works ONLY with letter size and A4 paper, and no other sizes. Duplexing on larger sizes is done MANUALLY, by turning the output end-for-end and replacing it in the paper tray. This forces us to do TWO print runs for each newsletter, rather than the anticipated ONE, so the expected gain in productivity is lost.<br /><br />Contrary to what some reviewers have said, we found that installation on our in-house wireless network was extremely easy -- and didn't even require the recommended USB cable mentioned in the documentation. The printer, the network, and all networked computers "found" each other automatically within a few seconds.<br /><br />I'm not sure our rating would have been 5-star even if this limitation had been clearly mentioned, as there are other makes that can to autoduplexing on larger paper. So it's four stars (at least until we discover more undocumented limitations).<br /><br />UPDATE: More missing features...<br /><br />1 - No manual feed option for printing. The only option for an occasional one- or two-sheet run on a "different" paper size is to replace a "standard" paper size in one of the cassettes, make the short run, and then reinstall the standard paper.<br /><br />2 - No ability to print "cover" or "card" stock, or any paper stock heavier than 24#. I guess this is coupled with the lack of a manual feed slot, which is the way 90% of competitive printers handle this chore.;;4.0;;August 18, 2012;;7;;7;;1.0

I wanted something with duplex so I would waste less paper (my previous HP printer did not have this option), and had to have wireless to make my life easier from my previous USB-necessitated existence. It's a pain to finish writing a paper at 2am while in my pajamas, ready to go to sleep, only to have to lug my laptop downstairs to my study where my HP printer is in order to plug in the USB cord to print the paper. I would much rather hit print from upstairs nestled in bed and just know that it would be there waiting for me in the morning to grab on my way out the door after I already had my laptop packed up for school.<br /><br />Reviews said this printer was easy to set-up, but it must have been engineers or computer science folks who wrote them! I consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to computers, and I definitely know my way around my wireless router's options menu, but I have just spent the last hour and a half trying to get this printer to print wirelessly to no avail!

Samsungs instructions don't work and the mac software and drivers on the disc also do not work.<br /><br />What I did was I connected an ethernet cord from the computer to the printer and then used the IP setup software on the disc to locate the printer (I had to disconnect from all wireless networks to ensure I didn't confuse the setup).<br /><br />You can get your computer's IP address in the Network tab of System Preferences.  Using the IP setup software on the Samsung disc, select the printer and click the button to change settings (it looks like a gear).  Change the IP address of the printer to that of your computer but change the last digit to something else( Ex: if the mac's ip is 1.2.3.4, change the printer's to 1.2.3.5).  Once that is done, make the subnet mask identical to that of your mac (subnet is also in system prefs) and save the settings.  Your printer will print out a confirmation page.  Then, with the ethernet cord still attached, type in the printer's new ip address in Safari.  You will then be able to access the printer's internal webpage.<br /><br />Once at the website, click the Network Configuration on the left (mine is in French so the English may be a bit different).  Then under that subheading, click TCP/IP.  Then in what shows up, you need to change the printer from having a static IP address to using DHCP.  Once you do that and save your settings, you should be able to print wirelessly using the ad hoc setting (meaning the computer has a direct wifi connection with the printer) once you connect to the "airportthru" network with your Airport card.<br /><br />If you want the printer available on your home network, go back into the printer settings and select your network and enter your password.  The printer will connect to your home network.<br /><br />I hope this works for you guys.  It worked for me and Samsung makes great products but has lousy support.;;4.0;;May 21, 2010;;41;;47;;0.87234

Setup was no more or less difficult than any other inkjet printer -- except that the software install disk was not compatible with Mac OS 10.8 (Mountain Lion), so you have to go to the Epson site to d/l the latest drivers and utilities. But that's not the deal breaker. What soured me immediately on this printer is Epson's unacceptable -- and unfortunately, characteristic -- lack of product detail and disclosure.<br /><br />If you purchase a wide format printer with automatic duplexing, you most likely do so because duplexing larger formats is a most welcome capability. Standard format duplexing printers (laser and inkjet) are a dime a dozen. But duplexing large format machines are hard to find unless you're prepared to spend really big bucks. So the 7010 is seductive at a sub-$200 price. However you have to unpack and set up the printer, install the software, and then try to print a large format 2-sided document only to discover that the 7010 DOES NOT duplex large format papers. Instead, your print dialog box displays the warning that you can only duplex letter, A4, A5, A6, and JISB5 sheets, and only in plain paper weights!<br /><br />Nowhere is this limitation stated. Not on the box. Not in the meagre in-pack documentation. Not on Epson.com or the barely useful online manual. In fact, it took over a half-hour for an offshore Epson phone tech to verify this for me. Ugh! The series should be renamed WorkFARCE, and the descriptor should be changed to Auto Duplex Sort Of.<br /><br />BTW, I did not buy this printer through Amazon, but at a big-box office supply retailer, who took the dog back and issued a full refund.;;2.0;;September 13, 2012;;8;;9;;0.888889

After it died for the umpteenth time over the course of many months but fewer than 100 total photos, I finally decided to give it to my 6 year old son to take apart. That gave him hours of pleasure. I was hoping that Epson's pro-level inkjet printer would have a superior build quality and wouldn't die because a small plastic part in the excess ink collector snaps off and fouls up the mechanism.<br /><br />Setting up the Epson 3880 is straight forward - plug it in, run a USB cable, install the printer software, and you're ready to go. There's no need for initial alignment, printhead installation, or anything other than fitting in the 9 ink cartridges. I've printed four photos so far - all 17x22" on Epson Velvet Fine Art Paper and UltraPremium Luster Paper. I printed one color and one black-and-white image on both. The printer uses matte black on the art paper and photo black on the standard paper. This is the one place where changing paper costs some ink since there's only one line serving these two ink carts and the earlier black needs to be emptied out before utilizing the appropriate black ink.<br /><br />The photos printed perfectly the first time, straight from Photoshop CS5 running on a Macintosh. The paper didn't skew as it fed in, the printer didn't suddenly display that one of the inks had run dry half way through a print, and you can't see the marks from the paper feed wheels on the final prints. Black and white prints look as if they came from a darkroom - yes, I can still tell the difference between a darkroom-based print and a digital print, but we're getting ever closer.<br /><br />The unit itself runs far more quietly than the HP did and I was impressed with the overall smoothness of the operation and the clearly higher quality of the hardware itself. The Mac talks to the printer correctly and I can easily obtain feedback on the Mac or from the LCD screen on the Epson regarding ink levels.<br /><br />It's early yet, so I'll be back with an addendum as my use progresses, but so far, I'm very impressed with the hardware, the manual, and Epson's photographic inks and papers.;;5.0;;September 25, 2010;;15;;15;;1.0

Had our 901 - or replacement 905 printers done so, we would have loved them, but after the original and three replacements failed, we gave up.  The original printer, the replacement printhead, the replacement 905, and a second replacement 905 all failed within 100 pages.  Words cannot describe the disappointment and frustration.  All we wanted was a printer that printed - consistently.<br /><br />This was a heartbreaking experience because the 901 (no longer available) and 905 are printers you want to love.  The interface screen, software, and overall utility of its multi-functions are amazing.  However, we have spent four months working with Lexmark customer service and still do not have a printer that works.  Kudos to Lexmark for answering the phone quickly.  They are courteous and follow up on their service.  They sent us a replacement printhead and two replacement computers (the last one a brand new 905).  None worked beyond 70 pages before failing with clogged printheads.<br /><br />In the end, Lexmark could not provide us with a printer that prints.  There is clearly a fundamental problem with their printheads and/or software.  Firmware upgrades, cleaning the printhead, replacing the printhead, new ink cartridges, and new printers all failed to fix the essential issue - printing.  This was akin to buying a car that won't start and going back to the dealership for a replacement engine and then two other cars - but still being unable to drive.  Would you try again?  No, we reluctantly must buy another brand and hope for a printer that prints.<br /><br />We negotiated a full refund from Lexmark and are now shopping for another brand.  If you have a success story with reliable LONG-TERM use of a multi-function printer, please share.  If you have bought a Lexmark and experienced what we did with printing, you are not alone.  Let's hope they can fix their manufacturing to bring their printhead up to the quality and utility level of the rest of the printer.;;1.0;;April 22, 2011;;9;;9;;1.0

So I was totally unprepared for the series of difficulties I have had with this device, so far not even attempting to use it for scanning or faxing. Basic printing functions are inconsistent and unreliable. My first problem was printing envelopes (paper mismatch error). This took about one hour on the phone with HP service to resolve, during which time I was told that the problem was with the Apple software I was using and not the driver (though further investigation showed this not to be true). Some days later (within the first week of use) other problems appeared with the wireless connection, and the printer appearing "offline" when it was connected and indicating a full strong wireless signal. I finally spent another hour on the phone with HP support recofiguring the printer as a USB device, connected by a cable to my computer -- no more wireless. Remarkably, that process was not at all straightforward, but I am now finding that although it initially printed under these circumstances, I am having problems again, just sending simple print jobs via USB. I have lost more of my productivity time due to this devices' shortcomings than at any other time in my business. Sending a single simple print job ends up taking 30 minutes of turning and turning off and rebooting and all various other things I can think of. Very sorry for this purchase -- not likely to purchase another HP multifunction device. I will add one thing: the HP Macintosh tech support team that I have spoken with were excellent, knowledgeable and helpful -- but who wants to spend all that time on the most basic printer setup issues??

Tech support is horrible;;Ok where do I begin with this one...<br /><br />Cons...<br /><br />Price - Very expensive if you want to be mobile with it.<br /><br />Printer ($250 plus shipping) along with the optional bluetooth adapter (an additional $80 or so plus shipping), and also the optional battery pack kit (an additional $140 plus shipping).  I paid a total of over $500 plus shipping costs for this printer and the accessories to be able to use it wireless.<br /><br />Included Software - Didnt auto install and doesnt always work<br /><br />I had to call tech support to find out if the disk was bad or what and we ended up going into the disk and manually installing each program which ended up not installing the icons or other little special things.<br /><br />Printer/Bluetooth Installation/Setup -<br /><br />If you are using a usb connection then you are ok but be warned of the "work arounds" needed and other problems when using the printer strictly with the bluetooth adapter.<br /><br />The printer would not install via the bluetooth connection right out of the box.  There is no documentation with the printer or bluetooth manual as to where the adapter should be installed either.  I had to call tech support to find out where to install the adapter.  I had to call twice to tech support in order for someone who would actually take the time out to help with the situation.<br /><br />Cannon has a very weird way of a work around to get the bluetooth adapter to work with the printer and computer.  First of all you have to figure out which way you want to connect the printer on your computer.  Your computer's bluetooth hardware has to be configured to work with Microsofts drivers for the printer to work properly such as giving you ink status and other functions.  You only have one way communication under Windows XP SP2 and that is to only print to the machine and nothing else.  The other draw back to this configuration is that other devices such as my wireless headset wouldnt work anymore using the microsoft drivers.  So, if I wanted both devices to work I had to use the device drivers that came with my computer's bluetooth adapter and I was back to square one with only one way communication to the printer but at least all other wireless devices would work again.<br /><br />When I called tech support about this problem they tried to help but didnt know about any such problems even though its all over the internet about people having problems getting the bluetooth to work properly or even at all with their bluetooth adapters that are installed in their pc.  One tech even had me uninstall the printers software and upon reboot the computer would not boot up at all.  I spent a month trying to reinstall everything back into the pc.<br /><br />Setup also requires you to install the printer using a usb connection first and then installing the printer again but with the bluetooth connection therefore installing two different printers.  Anytime you need to do something to this printer it has to be connected via usb to do any maintenance on it.<br /><br />This printer was a major pain to get up and running.<br /><br />Print speed/Quality -<br /><br />The printer takes a lot longer to print the same page of text compared to my lexmark x6170 all in one.  Also, in between each page there is a default drying time which can be changed to go longer but not turned off completely.<br /><br />Pros...<br /><br />Mobility - No need for wires or power adapters<br /><br />Small - fits in a briefcase or laptop bag easily<br /><br />Print Quality - is better than most small compact printers<br /><br />Cartridges - are cheap but dont really last that long since they are so small<br /><br />Do I recommend the printer you ask...yes i recommend it if you are a mobile person and need to print things on the spot anytime anywhere and are willing to shell out over $500 to do so.<br /><br />Once you do get it up and running properly you will not be dissapointed with it.;;3.0;;January 12, 2006;;26;;26;;1.0

As an added bonus, very cheap ink is available;;I am quite happy with this printer. The printer is easy to use, has great flexibility and can be used as not only as a printer but also as a scanner, copier, and fax machine. It can be hooked up wirelessly (aka Wi-Fi), or by USB or ethernet! Add in an automatic document feeder and I think you have a winner.<br /><br />Yet you won't see this printer at the top of most professional reviews for the simple reason that it is not as fast as many competitors. Yet Canon printers are very reliable and that was a major factor, for me, in making this purchase. Study after study rates Canon at the very top for reliability.<br /><br />A second factor in my choice is that very cheap aftermarket ink (I call it Chinese ink) is widely available. I own several other Canon printers and routinely feed them "Chinese ink". No matter who you buy these aftermarket ink cartridges from, they all appear to come from the same source in China. I have had excellent results with these cartridges and sometimes went through a 100 or more of them a year in very heavy duty business printing (on two other Canon ink-jet printers). But I was usually printing black and white invoices and shipping labels and only occasionally a color picture that was not meant for display. It is widely know that if you want high quality color pictures then you must use the manufacturer's paper and ink!<br /><br />I just installed five new "Chinese ink" cartridges in this very printer. These five aftermarket ink cartridges cost me just $5.00 total, including free shipping (that is not a misprint). To repeat - a total of five ink cartridges cost me only $5.00. See [...] here on Amazon. Unlike many other brands of printers, you will NOT get any annoying error messages when you use these aftermarket ink cartridges. Pop them in and they just work<br /><br />One final remark, the auto feeder works flawlessly!<br /><br />If reliability is important and cheap ink is also important and speed less so - then I heartily recommend this printer. If photo printing is a priority then I'd recommend the Canon MG6220 but you'll be giving up some business features like fax and automatic document feed. For high quality pictures there is little doubt you should stick with the manufacturer's ink and paper and the cost, per page, will increase significantly. Yet photo printing, using the manufacturer's ink and paper may be no more expensive than other brands of printers.<br /><br />The only negative to this printer is that it is a bit slow. It will not spit out a page in a few seconds, e.g., - it took 12 seconds, using only black and white, tweaking the printer to its very fastest setting, to print out a single page, here, at Amazon.;;5.0;;September 8, 2012;;7;;7;;1.0

However, my old HP printer had great scanning software that recognized multiple photos automatically (without the user cropping or using handles to select the photos) from a single scan and saved them individually to separate files.  I have lots of old photos that I want to digitize, so this old HP feature was an important one for me.  I first purchased an HP 6900 series from Costco for less than $150.  The set-up was very easy, however I was disappointed to learn that the software no longer had the scan feature I needed.  I returned the printer.  I did more research, and learned that the only companies that offer this scan feature were Kodak and Canon.  Kodak advertised inexpensive ink.  I never had a Kodak printer, and Wallmart had one advertised for $100.  I read more reviews, and they were mostly negative. Several reviewers claimed cartridges were less expensive, but they bought more cartridges than with their HP printers.  I checked out Best Buy, and as another reviewer mentioned, this Canon printer was in-stock, but at the time was selling for $199 which was over my budget. I didn't have to wait long for this printer to go on sale at Best Buy for $149.99, so I purchased it.<br /><br />The installation of this Canon printer was more difficult than the HP.  HP installation was done from a menu screen on the printer.  I have a wireless network, its secured, and HP immediately recognized that a key was required, AND the router was set up to allow only approved MAC Addresses to join the network.  When I pressed OK on the printer, it printed a sheet of paper with the printer's MAC Address!  How cool is that?<br /><br />Canon on the other hand detected a wireless network, and simply said there was an error connecting and suggested trying again later.  I then went into manual wireless network set-up mode from the printer panel, and it asked for the key, but again had an error message (of course) because I hadn't provided the router with the printer MAC address! So since I was still setting up the machine, and didn't really know where to find the MAC address, I found a one page brochure in the box with the URL to info about the printer.  After a bit of searching on the Canon website, and the online user manual, I was able to find the MAC address for the printer through the printer panel.  I entered it for the router, and it connected immediately.  I tried printing from my laptop, and it printed just fine.<br /><br />Then, I tried printing from my iPhone.  Nothing happened.  In my earlier research, I recalled a reviewer saying they had to go out to the Canon site to download firmware for Airprint2. I went out to the website, and sure enough, the version of software that came with this printer was not the very latest, and did not have Airprint2.  So, I downloaded the firmware executable file to my desktop.  However, when I clicked on the downloaded exe it wouldn't allow me to choose where to decompress the files.  It automatically decompressed them, and put them "somewhere".  And it happened so fast, I couldn't see a file name to search for initially.  Eventually I found the file I needed on the desktop with the instructions for updating the firmware.  It did require a USB cable which was not included, but we had one from our last printer.  After the installation, printing from my cell phone worked great!  One feature I haven't found yet that was available on the HP printer was the ability to email to the printer.  The HP printer had an email address.  I'm not sure yet when I would use this, but I haven't found the feature for the Canon printer.<br /><br />I tried scanning multiple photos briefly, and there are two choices one can make: either use the MP Navigator software or within the MP Navigator software there's a choice to scan the photos using the scanner driver.  I tried both ways, and both recognized that there were five photos on the scanning bed and separated the five photos into five files. I don't know what the difference between the two is yet. This is the feature I was looking for, and I'm excited to start scanning.  Being wireless, I can move the printer in front of the TV if I want, too.<br /><br />Then I decided to try setting up the FAX.  HP did this automatically.  It ran some tests and asked some questions, and determined what connection I needed based on the responses.  I have a VoIP phone, one phone number, so there isn't a dedicated FAX number, and an electronic answering service and desktop answering machine. I had to look at several different configurations in order to determine the best set-up.  I'm not positive I picked the right one. My phone rings, the FAX sends, but I haven't tried receiving a FAX yet.  I didn't find a feature for setting up the number of rings, so will the answering machine pick up or will the FAX pick up?<br /><br />I haven't tried printing photos yet.  This printer doesn't claim to be a "photo printer".  The speed of normal printing seems fine.  I am concerned about ink costs, but one online editorial review said the cartridges for this new printer are comparable to other printers in the same class, so that's encouraging.<br /><br />So for the reasons above, I knocked the printer down a star.  If you are the person who installed your wireless network like me, it's probably only worth a half star, but I could see how the setup might be very difficult for some if they haven't installed their wireless network.;;4.0;;May 7, 2012;;91;;101;;0.90099

The ip-3600's internal construction does not appear to be as good as the S800; however it is easy to set up and get to work and it provides well balanced color prints immediately.<br /><br />The print quality of both documents and photographs is very good. The negatives (on this printer)are that printing from the cassette almost always results in paper jams or misfeeds (which is a big pain in the neck) if you are printing a reasonable sized document. This has caused me to use only the rear paper source for both document and photo printing. The iP-3600 is also pretty slow; there seems to be lots of internal set up taking place when you initiate a print, before the print scan action takes place.<br /><br />Given the low price of the iP-3600, it performs pretty well as a proof-run desk printer. I wouldn't try to use it to run big jobs, like printing manuals. Another plus is it seems to be pretty frugal in terms of ink usage, which is always a major consideration for inkjet printer users. The paper cassette requires that you have unobstructed access to it, so you may want to position the printer at right angles to the end of a desk.;;3.0;;January 23, 2012;;7;;7;;1.0

It's fast, quiet, easy, good-looking, inexpensive, and did I mention fast?  It was so easy to set up.  Wireless was set up in a minute and after the initial 10 minute boot-up and alignment sequence, I was off and running.  Scanning wirelessly is a breeze.  Scans multiple documents to a single PDF file in seconds!  I am very impressed.  People have complained about the ink consumption, but I haven't had that problem.  The cartridges are small, but they are also CHEAP!  $14.00 buys you a full set, vs $70.00 and up for HP and other printers.  The print quality is amazing, and the color is bright and clear.  I would definitely recommend this printer to anyone.  If nothing else, the wireless function (which was a real pain in the rear on HP) is worth its wait in gold.

It is a great all in one device. Excellent print quality, sleek design with small foot print compare to other competitors. I would have given 5 stars but I had 2 issues and one concern.<br /><br />1)The setup for FAX was not clear specially when an answering machine is involved. Luckily I had installed EPSON Workforce 500 model for my parents a while ago, and their manual had clear illustration of the setup. This manual is confusing with no clear illustration, I compared both printers Quick Guide manual and the wording was clearly different, and was not clear and subject to interpretation.<br /><br />2)After installing the software from the included CD, I had to download several updates, drivers and utilities which were not on the CD. They were not organized in a manor that will take away the assumption, which one I need and which I don't. That consumed over an hour of time to decide, download and install. I was lucky I'm on a MAC, but installing on wife's PC with Windows it was more torturous and time consuming. I wish they'll improve it by either packaging all updated into one download (they have it, but it does not contain all utilities).<br /><br />My concern is; too much use of plastic parts, all brands use them, they are delicate and if one is care less they can easily be broken, and cause you aggravation of getting it fixed or living with it. My old Photo Stylus 1200 had much sturdier plastic parts than this all in one, also my Samsung laser printer paper tray is solid, it has some plastic but mostly light metal. I understand they want to keep the price down, but they should consider using more sturdier material for most common used areas of the printer, specially the paper tray, the exit pullout tray, I'm afraid to exert any force when pulling, from fear of breaking it.;;4.0;;December 5, 2010;;24;;25;;0.96

Having a Fax is helpful for me now that it is a real pain to get out of the house, so having a Fax lets me send forms back & forth to work & my Doctors.<br /><br /> HP uses eFax Fax service when you receive this printer you are allowed to send & receive up to 20 Faxes per month for free , if you are going to send more than that you have to sign up for a eFax paid service. The Scanner & Copier are fantastic & they work great. The Tablet works almost like a smaller version of the iPad, It can get Email Facebook & you can print just about everything. Most of the Print Apps are more geared for kids but they also have Apps that will give Weather, Movie Times/Tickets etc..<br /><br /> I like the fact that it has two paper trays one for 8"-10" paper & one for photo paper. The printer is completly wireless the one wire that is coming out of the back of the printer the other end of it is going into the outlet. Setup was so easy the printer did most of the work just plug it in turn it on follow the steps on the screen & when it tells you to install the software on you computer. Eprint & Airprint are awesome, Every printer has their own email address all you have to do is just compose a Email put the printers Email in the address bar & whatever you want to print just cut & paste the link to the Email send it & it will be waiting for you when you get home from work or vacation whatever.<br /><br />  You can send print jobs to your printer from anywhere in the world, it can be from you laptop or from your smartphone. Airprint lets you print from almost any apple product ie iPod touch, iPhone & the iPad. Print quality is great, print speed is super fast. What I would recomend you do is stock up on ink & buy the extra large ones so they will last longer.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful.;;5.0;;June 18, 2011;;4;;5;;0.8

After hooking it up, which didn't seem like too much of a problem, the paper and ink lights won't stop blinking.  I went into the printer utility on the computer and it says "General Error" and that I had to clear a foreign object out or something.  I looked this thing over and over again and there are no foreign objects anywhere.  There's no paper jams, there's no packaging left over and there's none of that tape on it.  You shouldn't spend $[...] on something and not have it work even just once.<br /><br />I am so insanely frustrated about this whole experience right now.  In fact, I keep on glancing over and seeing those stupid lights blinking and it makes me want to throw it through a window.  The worst thing about all of this is that I live in a small town without a whole lot around it.  I drove over 2 and a half hours to get this and 2 and a half hours back.  Now, I'm going to have to piss away another 5 hours of my life taking this thing back and hoping that they have another printer in stock (not an Epson, that's for damn sure).<br /><br />I sent an email to their support.  Maybe they'll write me back with some good news about an easy fix or tell me how to send it back at their expense so I don't have to drive another 5 hours.  I doubt it.  You obviously can't expect a whole lot from a company that charges you [...] bucks for something and is too cheap to even throw in a USB cable.;;1.0;;December 5, 2009;;14;;15;;0.933333

I should have known right out the box that there was going to be problems when after install the print heads moved once and locked up. After spending over 1 hour with the HP Support Staff we found the problem to be "extra loose parts" jammed down inside the printer. (What!) Extra unknown parts! Are you kidding me! I was told by the HP Support person to return the printer to the place of purchase, after I emailed HP Support photos of the head jam and the "unknown parts". This was all within 4 hours after purchase!<br /><br />I accepted a new replacement PRO 8000 printer and the horror didn't go away. This second printer is a "PIG" on paper and ink. At frequent times before the printer prints a page it will spit out 1-2 sheets of blank paper?? Sometimes the paper is covered in ink swatches and sometimes not. Combine that with ink cartridges that are very expensive and only last 2-3 weeks after normal to light duty use makes my wallet light. Additionally the supplied software is not of any help.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Don't buy this printer, its cheaply made.

So far I've only used it via IRDA and a USB connection -- I don't have the battery kit, car adapter, nor the Bluetooth adapter, so I can't comment on those.  As to the printer itself:<br /><br />+++ Prints surprisingly fast; I was really stunned by how quickly it spits out pages.<br /><br />+++ Photos look quite good; also better than I expected.  I tried out printing directly from a Windows Mobile phone (over IRDA) with one the 10 sheets of photo paper Canon includes with the printer; worked like a charm!<br /><br />+++ Great compact size with a reasonable weight... I found one of those "zipper three ring binders" -- where the actual binder rings were removable -- and it makes a great carrying case (since it includes folders for paper!), all for $9.99.<br /><br />+++ The printer driver natively supports (manual) duplexing, 2-up/4-up/etc. printing, and otherwise is quite full-featured (these days almost everything I print is 2-up/duplexed -- I just don't want the bulk of all that extra paper); not at all 'crippled' like, say, HP printer drivers are for their super-cheap, kinda-compact printers (e.g., the 35xx family).  Granted, for the price you pay for the ip90, this should be the case.<br /><br />--- Text printouts aren't really as black as I'd like; closer to a dark gray.<br /><br />--- Lines are a little more 'jagged' that what most printers produce these days.<br /><br />--- True, the price is expensive, although if you think about it, it's still dirt cheap to what printers cost even just 5 years ago.  The pricing of printers in general has become warped since then, with the marketing shifting to selling the mass-market printers for little more than cost and making all the profit on the ink... I suppose that Canon figures that with a portable printer like this, you probably won't really be doing THAT much printing, so they'd better get their profit up front?<br /><br />Overall, I'm quite satisfied.  This is a solid product, and -- at least from what I've read in reviews -- seems noticeably better than HP's portable entries.;;4.0;;January 23, 2006;;23;;25;;0.92

The<br />9840 had a horrible toner leaking problem as well as lots of banding<br />in the color prints.  So far the prints on the 9970 are as good as can<br />be expected from a laser.

But if you open the manual in one browser window and the machine's web interface in another and then accept that Xerox knows more about their machine than you do... it all works fine.<br /><br />Some features are especially nice.  One very useful one is that it you can put a stack of pages in the feeder and then scan them directly to a folder on your computer in one of several formats.  Another useful feature, especially for small business types, is that incoming faxes can be set to automatically forward to your email as a PDF file.  This is great because if an order or contract is sent by fax you can get it on your Blackberry or iPhone when away from the office.<br /><br />The only "fault" I have with it is the machine's control panel.  It uses a telephone keypad for all data input which makes things like entering Email addresses and mixed-case passwords sluggish.  Perhaps Xerox will put a better human interface on the next generation.<br /><br />Otherwise... a very good product that demonstrates good value.;;4.0;;January 29, 2010;;15;;15;;1.0

Considering that most Windows 7 users will eventually have SP1 installed automatically if they're using Windows Updates, that makes it a no-go for Win 7 in general. The print server utility installed OK, and I was able to configure the IP address for my network, but then I ran into difficulty, because it would not install my printer driver. I reached TrendNet tech support within a few minutes, and after running through the configuration and getting two different error messages, the agent put me on hold. When he returned, he said there are known problems with Win 7 SP1, and he wouldn't be able to get it running for me.<br /><br />Fortunately, I had somewhat anticipated the possibility of a problem like this, because so many users on this Amazon product page reported one issue or another. So when I ordered the TE100-P21, I also ordered as a back-up the TrendNet TU2-NU4, which is called a 4-Port Network USB Hub. The tech support agent kindly stayed on the line with me while I uninstalled the first unit and installed the TU2-NU4. The installation from the included utility CD went flawlessly and I was able to print immediately. The only strange thing that happened was that my printer (HP Color LaserJet CP1215) started printing old files that may have been leftover from abandoned print queues in the past. I was able to open the print queue and cancel everything, so no harm done except for some wasted paper.<br /><br />I gave this 3 stars only because I got prompt, courteous, and helpful customer tech support on a Sunday afternoon. Their telephone tech support is open 24/7. How many other companies offer that? Not many. So really I would give them 5 stars for tech support, and 1 star for Windows 7 compatibility. If you're running Win 7, check out the TU2-NU4. Nice thing about is that it also supports external HDs and flash drives. I suppose I might not have been as kind in my rating if I hadn't had the TU2-NU4 waiting in the wings. I would be growling instead!<br /><br />One other semi-relevant note: I don't get the folks who complain about a product in their review and say, "This is just another paperweight in my office now."

I suppose I should also mention that when I told HP I had a print server handling jobs (good practice when you have an office full of printers and prefer keeping your hair on your head rather than between your fingers as you pull them out), and that I had established a DHCP reservation so the printer would obtain IP information dynamically, but always be given the same address - let's just say that drove HP technical support up a wall; almost to the point where they just about put the kibosh on the entire support call. I suppose the kind of training that goes into those that support these is different than those that support, say, LJ 8150s.<br /><br />The end result was after being told:<br /><br />A) I had a bad toner cartridge (at which point jumped through the proverbial hoop and went out to buy a spare)<br /><br />B) There were "multiple" bad ports on my Extreme Networks Summit X450-48p switch (yeah right, pretty sure I would have noticed that)<br /><br />C) That ethernet printing was either "not supported entirely" or that at most it was "only supported being connected to a home Linksys router"<br /><br />D) Not having enough paper loaded into the device (even when it was full)<br /><br />We finally came to find that when a print job is sent via the Post Script driver this printer TANKS.<br /><br />And when I say "tanks", I mean:<br /><br />A) Web interface stops working<br />B) Ping requests time out<br />C) The NIC completly shuts down (link light drops offline)<br />D) The printer appears to restart / re-initialize (yellow lights flicker on the top)<br />E) You have to wait 15-20 seconds for it to come back up<br /><br />Worse yet, after being sent a job via PS (and it subsequently goes into it's fit of rage), it usually requires a restart to remain stable. I found this out because while testing I had a continuous ping going throughout all of this, and it would randomly time out long after the restart / reinitializing sequence was complete - even when no job was being sent. The only way to get it to remain stable again was to completely shut it off and reboot. WOW - What a joke!<br /><br />Moral of the story, I'm rating this a 4 because if you don't even think Post Script, it's actually a good light-duty (all I'm planning on using it for) printer that absolutly WILL work in a network environment (in a business or otherwise). Just make sure you don't try to use a Post Script driver, unless you enjoy making your brain hurt watching your printer act a fool for no apparent reason.<br /><br />PS: I generally NEVER write reviews about things (even though, full disclosure, I read them all the time). That said, the wasted afternoon I spent troubleshooting this was SUCH A PAIN IN THE REAR that I couldn't resist the temptation to share my experiance with those of you wanting to pick this puppy up. Hope it's helpful for you!;;4.0;;March 29, 2011;;30;;34;;0.882353

The platinum pro is a heavier weight photo paper and this might help in the pickup, however it also had no problem when i used a good quality regular paper for printing documents.<br /><br />I considered the pigment ink version (9500 model), which is also substantially pricier, but as i understand with the 9500 model you have to use it about everyday so the inks do not clog, and this less expensive version actually got better reviews in terms of color gammat and output quality.<br />If i was to purchase a pigment ink printer, i would go with the Epson 3800 which is $1,000 and has a 24" feed. When you start at the epson 3800 and up, they use larger tanks which make ink cheaper<br /><br />I experimented with both letting the printer manage the color profile and letting lightroom/photoshop manage it using the supplied platinum paper pro profiles - much better letting photoshop/lightroom manage it.<br />If you have the App (photoshop/lightroom) manage it, be sure to turn off the printer managing the profile by going to the printer driver --> properties --> the tab called Main, and in the color/intensity area select manual. Then click on the Set... button and chose NONE<br /><br />I also experimented with 8 bit and 16 bit (XPS) driver (i use primarily a 16 bit workflow), cannot say i noticed much difference, but it is stil early days.<br /><br />It even comes with a copy of Abode Elements 8 (however that was not of use for me)<br /><br />Amazons price on Platinum Pro paper makes it not really worth looking at ilford or red river for glossy printer<br />(Hint: do not skimp on using a quality paper, i.e., forget cheaper walmart brands and entry level photo papers, btter to have one really nice print than two mediocre ones)<br /><br />In terms of noise some reviewers mentioned, cannot say this was a problem at all for me, but i expect inkjet printers to make some noise.<br />It is a different kind of noise than a computer, more mechanical, where a computer is fan and humming noise (i do not like computer noise). Perhaps if the printer was on a desk top next to your keyboard it would be a consideration.<br /><br />In the past i had a smaller pixma printer that had trouble with feed and eventually broke as unable to register a cartridge on it, but this one seems much better made. My experience with epson is that they make nice prints when they work, but they are finicky, take a ton of ink and are always clogging.<br /><br />Bottom line - i do not think you could get a better printer for under $1000<br />and Canon ink tanks seem to last longer than other brands. You will probably use the Magenta ink, and perhaps black, the fastest, something to do with the internal algorithm determining what combination of inks to use.;;5.0;;November 16, 2010;;16;;16;;1.0

It is important to cover this with a piece of opaque tape.  Otherwise the printer will give a "low toner" warning and refuse to work, even though there is still plenty of toner in the cartridge.<br /><br />For years now, printer manufacturers have been using the "low toner"/"low ink" trick to force customers to buy more toner/ink than necessary - at prices that are often nothing short of gouging.  This should be illegal.  I threw my last Canon printer in the trash because of this.<br /><br />Despite this, I highly recommend the HL-2140 for the simple fact that it is so easy to defend yourself against the "low toner trick".  This will save lots of money.  All other characteristics of the printer, except the manual paper feeder, are excellent.;;5.0;;January 8, 2010;;7;;7;;1.0

There are many problem issues with this printer:<br />- Although duplex printing is advertised as selling point, this only applies to printing from PC. There is no 2 on 2 sided copying and certainly not 2 on 2 sided scanning, neither from ADF nor glass platen. It only does 1 on 2, or 2 on 1, for these functions. You would still need to turn the paper stack over manually and be aware of orientation and repeat the copy or scan process to get a 2 on 2. This feature is not explicitly mentioned in specs, and just hearing the word duplex printing might fool you to think it does have these features.<br />- Print quality is not as sharp or crisp as in Inkjet prints, which is ironic and interesting.<br />- Paper wrinkles in a wavy manner after print, applied heat seems to be excessive.<br />- scanning is unreliable and frustrating when using multiple papers through the ADF. It is slow and frequently fails and gives error message only at the end of the scan.<br />- It is too loud for home environment when dialing fax, even with lowest monitor volume settings, unless you turn it off, but then you don't know what is happening.<br />- The menu functions are tediously complicated and not user friendly. You have to go through a lot of steps to complete a function.<br />- Overall construction quality is flimsy, with cheap plastic all around. must be very careful when you move it around.<br />I would recommend this MFP only for basic light office work, or in a house room with good sound isolation.;;3.0;;April 8, 2009;;32;;37;;0.864865

R7IG5R24L2R4G;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1GURTJV4C6KHW;;Printer;;B002PLQ7LI;;Epson Stylus Pro 3880 Color Inkjet Printer (CA61201-VM);;A product line that has truly improved and matured;;This printer was purchased to replace an Epson Stylus Pro 4000 that I have been using for about the past 3 years.  When the 4000 came out, it was supposed to be technological breakthrough and had multiple rave reviews.  Ultimately, I've been disappointed with it, both from a "quality of final print" and "ease of printing" standpoint.  The Epson Stylus Pro 3880 is two generations beyond the 4000, and corrects the major flaws of its predecessor.<br /><br />I consider myself an advanced amateur photographer, having printed all of my own photographs (B&W and color) in the darkroom for more than 25 years.  I'm really comparing the results of the Stylus Pro printers to the best results that I could achieve using traditional methods.  Digital photography is going to replace 99% of traditional photo processing, so the standard seems fair.<br /><br />From a print quality standpoint, the SP 4000 suffered from significant bronzing (metallic sheen when viewed at an angle), metamerism (color shifts dependent on lighting) and gloss differential (difference in sheen depending on thickness of ink sprayed in an area).  The majority of these flaws have been addressed by the latest generation of ink (Ultrachrome K3 with Vivid Magenta) and the newest printhead.  On B&W prints, where bronzing was the biggest issue, bronzing is now completely absent on prints using Epson Exhibition Fiber paper and Ultra Premium Luster.  I also don't appreciate any significant color shifts (metamerism) when viewing prints under different lighting conditions or different angles.  Gloss differential has been significantly improved, but not completely eliminated.  With the SP 4000, the ink would turn glossy surfaces semigloss, leaving a very distracting pattern.  With the SP 3880, the only areas with  subtle gloss differential are areas where there is no ink at all (washed out highlights).  If there is any ink at all on the surface, the print looks even and smooth, even on glossy paper.<br /><br />The quality of the prints are really quite amazing.  For the first time in my life, I looked at a couple of prints that I made in the "Advanced B&W" mode and had to admit that they were as good as anything that I could have produced in the  darkroom.  The Epson Exhibition Fiber paper (F surface) has a look and feel very similar to the Ilford FB (fiber based) Glossy paper that I used to print on.  The color prints are also stunning.  Although the Ilfochrome prints I used to make had a level of color depth and saturation that was hard to beat, these SP 3880 prints are at least 98% as good with 20% of the effort and 100% better control (via Photoshop).<br /><br />The machine itself appears reasonably well built and thoughtfully designed.  It's not quite the beast that the 4000 was, but that's mostly a good thing.  This machine can actually be lifted by one person and takes up a footprint that's about 20% less than the 4000.  The front door where the prints come out does seem a bit flimsy, but with care it should hold up.  The only unanswered question for me regards ink jet clogging.  The SP 4000 was very difficult to unclog if it sat unused for a week or two.  I would estimate that at least half my ink went towards unclogging the print head.  I understand that the newest generation is supposed to be better, but I'll find out over the next few months.  Right now, the printer is being used nearly daily, trying to reprint all of the pictures that I was 80% satisfied with in the past.<br /><br />In summary, the Stylus Pro 3880 is a significant advancement from older machines.  It might not be enough to justify upgrading from a 3800, but if you're using a 4000/7600/9600 generation machine, you'll never regret it.<br /><br />Addendum:  The one year follow-up!<br />After one year of printing fairly regularly, I have to say that I am still very pleased with the printer.  The most amazing thing, by far, is the fact that the ink jets have never clogged even once.  The old SP 4000 clogged even after 5 days of disuse.  Although I'm generally printing small photos, I'm actually still on my first set of ink cartridges.  I easily went through 5-10 times the amount of ink with the SP 4000.  I didn't realize how much ink I was actually wasting clearing the ink jets regularly (in spite of never running a "power" cleaning).  My only minor complaint with the printer is still the mild gloss differential.  For more critical prints, I've sprayed on PremierArt's Print Shield with good results.  No other issues so far and many outstanding prints in both color and B&W.;;5.0;;November 1, 2009;;306;;308;;0.993506

Thus if you have to scan a stack of papers that is not 8.5" x 11", then you may have a problem.  Fortunately, the Window's software was by far more flexible, and you can scan more types of paper.  To artificially limit the features of the scanner with poorly implemented software makes the scanner definitely a bad choice for Macintosh users.

I bought a MX870 at Costco after an older model Canon multifunction inkjet bit the dust after only 2 years of home use.<br /><br />The MX870 played nicely with my iMac and my Windows notebook PCs. I loved its features, including the wireless capability and auto duplexing. Print quality was - originally - very good. But things went downhill starting about 60 days after setup. Print quality became erratic, requiring multiple ink-gobbling runs of cleaning and alignment utilities, each time producing only temporary improvements.<br /><br />I finally boxed the MX870 up and took it back for a refund. At least I got my purchase price back. But in the 90 days I owned the MX870, it went through a complete set of replacement ink cartridges, except for I think one of the four color cartridges. The second set of replacement cartridges was in the unit when it went back to the store, meaning I'd bought two sets. Even at the bargain prices I paid for those two sets of cartridges, that was more than a hundred bucks worth of ink!<br /><br />Since then I've been making do with a cheap, lightweight, reliable Canon Pixma iP2600 Photo Inkjet Printer (2435B002) - which I'd bought at a discount chain store for thirty dollars, and used to complete some word processing projects at the home of an older relative. For more serious document printing I've purchased a (B&W only) Brother HL-5370DW Laser Printer with Wireless Networking and Duplex. I think I'm done with multifunction inkjet printers, for good.<br /><br />EDITED to add, in response to a comment that I got 90 days from one set of cartridges so how is that so bad: I didn't get "90 days out of one set of ink." ALL the original cartridges were used up, and then the ENTIRE first set of replacement cartridges. That's two sets right there. The third set was in the machine when I returned it to Costco, with the exception of one of the color cartridges. So it was more like 2.5 sets in 90 days. I wasn't doing heavy-duty amounts of printing, either.;;2.0;;October 9, 2010;;9;;10;;0.9

The two-sided (duplex) printing is amazingly quick and jam-free. The toner is $100+ each, and there are 4 toner cartridges. The ones that come with the stock machine are NOT full-service toner cartridges: they contain less toner and are only rated at 1200 pages each. The machine is noisy on start-up, but not bad as it prints. The software CD does NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 7.  It says that on the documentation that comes with the printer and on their website. You can download the printer drivers from the HP site easily but if you keep your Win7 updated, it has its own drivers for the CP2020 series that work on the 2025dn.<br /><br />Be SURE to find the manual online, too. The menu on the printer's panel display offers many options, including one I found crucial: continue printing even if toner is getting low. The default setting is "Stop Printing If Toner Low," which means that at default, you will not be able to print when the toner cartridge is down to 6% toner left. I re-set mine to "override" and continue printing even if toner reaches only 6%.  You can also adjust at what point the toner is considered "low." Default is 6%.<br /><br />You also need to read the Manual to find out how to set up your printer for duplex printing: the default drivers will ALLOW duplex printing if you set the properties correctly in the Windows Printer Control Panel.  There are many more settings you need to explore, and if you don't read the online manual (downloadable as a PDF file--which I saved to my hard drive for future reference) you may miss some of the excellent features of this machine.<br /><br />I gave it a 4-star rating because there are features (beyond just printer drivers) available in the original installation software that you cannot access even with download if you have Windows 7. Given the ubiquity of Win7, that is inexcusable. Also, typical HP, they do not provide a cable with the printer. Finally, the toner costs also contribute to keeping this from being a 5-star machine.  Even at 4-star rating, though, I do love the machine and unless I found something with cheaper toner and equal number of features, I would buy the machine again.;;4.0;;February 8, 2011;;7;;7;;1.0

It was a replacement for an older (now) outdated HP printer that I own. I have to say I am absolutely in love with it. It's one of the quietest printers I've ever used. It has a ton of incredible features too. I like how there's a separate space for both photo paper and regular printer paper. I also like how it can do duplex printing if you want (which is when you have it print on both sides of the paper instead of just one). It also has a Quiet feature which will make the printer even quieter during times when you need for it to be less noisy (though like I said on its own WITHOUT using the Quiet feature it's not really that noisy imo).<br /><br />I have printed both pictures (using Glossy photo paper) and regular documents with it since getting it and let me tell you it does a terrific job. The pictures look like they came right from a photo lab department and not from an all in one printer. The quality of the pictures is THAT great. The regular documents? They came out good too.<br /><br />In summary I think for all the features it has this is an amazing printer and it's one of the best all in one printers I've used. I'd definitely recommend this printer to anyone who's looking for an all in one printer and is especially wanting excellent quality when printing pictures.;;5.0;;December 4, 2010;;5;;5;;1.0

This printer has an automatic document feeder, fax machine (which I do not use), and automatic double sided copy.<br /><br />The printer prints relatively fast, it takes a few moments (about 3 seconds) after you send the document for it to wake up, and then it starts printing and takes about a second or two for normal pages (one page) (simple text document).  It is easy to send the print jobs as two sided, since the printer puts the first page out, and then sucks it back in and prints the back, really quick!  For printing I am very happy with it, the pages look good and it is relatively fast!<br /><br />THe printer was easy to install and put together, when setting it up, it shows videos of what to do when you turn it on, and all you have to install is the two sided printing item in the back, the ink cartridges, and paper.  It will print out your instructions for ePrint.  I set up a static IP address to give access to my network across all devices, and also set up a reservation for it on my router (DHCP reservation), to ensure that the router does not try to give that IP to some other device.  Since the item connects to the internet for ePrint, I gave it the Google's DNS server.  I used the HP CD to install it on my Windows 7 machine (full software), which was easy to accomplish (since Windows Update did not seem to find a driver for it.  I downloaded the driver only version from HP for my Win 7 Virtual Machine, since I do not need extra capabilities in the VM.  I used the System Preference Printer Option to install it for Mac (Mac OS X 10.7) which found the drivers and installed the Printer and scan functionality, the Mac also recognized that it had two sided capabilities.  All my computers had no problem getting the printer installed and working, if you are having trouble I recommend a DHCP reservation (get the wireless MAC address if you are using wireless -- wired and wireless cards have different MAC addresses even in the same device), and then a Static IP address, and do not forget about DNS (for ePrint), if you are unsure use Google's DNS server.<br /><br />The copier works great and allows for two sided copying at the machine, the touch screen and buttons are easy to use (you have to apply a little pressure but not much (more than an iPhone).  It automatically recognizes items in the ADF and allows for easy copying.<br /><br />You can scan from the HP software (Windows) or from the Mac scan utility, or the iPhone HP app, scanning works great and supports scan from ADF and glass (even on iPhone >> go to Settings to choose on App).<br /><br />I have not tried the Fax, since I do not have a fax line (or a phone line), so I can not provide much information on this, but a fax machine is pretty normal on most devices.<br /><br />My iPhone recognized the printer instantly and I was able to use AirPrint to print from any app that supports printing (Like Mail and Safari) with no problem and can even choose to print two sided on the iPhone.  I set up ePrint and was created an email address for my printer, and set it up to only print from email addresses that I own.  The apps are pretty cool and the recipes and crosswords print good quality and are useful, however, I do not use the subscription service (where it prints automatically on certain days).  However, you can just print the once from the app without having to subscribe, you can use the ePrint center website to customize your apps and order and subscriptions.  Extremely easy to use.<br /><br />In the end I am extremely happy with this printer, it offers everything I need and I hope that the HP Ink yields approximately as many papers as it claims, if so that will save me a lot of money!!!<br /><br />I also wanted to add that the Fax number lights stay on all the time (even when asleep), I am assuming this could be from the recent Software Update the printer had, maybe they will fix this...  However, it is not a big problem, and it could be in response of many thinking the machine did not work since they did not light up originally.<br /><br />I placed card stock (110 lbs weight) on top of the paper already in the printer and printed one page (from Mac), and the printer would not grab the paper, it would just say out out paper.  However, I reprinted it and told it (Mac printer Options under Presets) that the paper was PhotoPaper and it printed fine (kind of slow), but it did print on the card stock with no jam or problem. -- Just FYI, in case you are having trouble with card stock.  I did this on Mac, but the same should work in Windows.<br /><br />The Printer also has card readers and a USB port, when you put a device in their, the printer also shares the device with the network so you can find the printer in Network (or under Shared in Mac Finder).  If it is not showing up you can use COMMAND + K and enter SMB://[printer IP] and login as Guest and the printer will mount the memory device.<br /><br />I am happy with the printer and have the highest hopes on the Ink yield and longevity of the printer!  I will update you on the ink as soon as it runs out (which hopefully will not be for a while :)<br /><br />UPDATE: The fax lights staying on (mentioned earlier), has fixed itslef.  Now The Fax lights have turned off and now turn on only when opening the fax menu or on applications that have text input. Once I restarted the printer the fax lights corrected themselves. -- Just FYI.<br /><br />Update (April 21), it has been about 3 month and I wanted to add that after regular printing (school papers, receipts, taxes) that the printer still shows that all ink cartridges are all full (you can barely tell that the levels have changed), the ink usage on this printer makes it amazing!  I will let you know when I eventually have to buy ink, which may be well into the next year at the current rate!!!!  -- Just FYI!!!;;5.0;;January 19, 2012;;9;;9;;1.0

It is awesome!  I got it for my small business.  I have to print around 350 copies per week in color and two-sided.  It's fast and good.  One of the main factors that made me decide for this printer is that the toner will last for around 2500 copies and with high yield (more expensive toner) it will last for 3500 copies (generic brand) and 6000 copies (brother brand  The other printers last between 1200 - 2500 depending on the toner and brand.  Now, I have not replaced my toners yet, but i printed already 1700 copies (black and color) I am pretty sure that i should buy toners before i run out.  Overall, i would recommend this printer.;;4.0;;September 20, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0
R1J9JN83JVHZ1S;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3NQP17O7WPWRC;;Printer;;B004H5YBU4;;Samsung Color Laser Printer (CLP-325W);;Less Like Laser: More Like Thermal Wax Transfer;;First things first:  This unit is more like a thermal wax transfer printer (for those of you old enough to remember those) than a laser. I didn't know this until after I bought it and read that it puts down a thin layer of wax to create colors. When crinkled, you can see the wax "crack" or wear down. True laser printers don't use wax. Okay, not that huge of a deal breaker because of the low price.<br /><br />But then there's the question of how economical it is to keep.  The replacement toner cartridges cost more than the unit itself. Other reviews talked about how it drains power out of the sockets - it's totally true! Our computer room has 4 breakers, with the overhead fan/light & desk lamps on the lowest powered one (the original - we added the rest). The first time I turned it on, ALL of the lights flickered for more than a few seconds. When you power it up or print to it, it sucks the electricity right out of the wall! That can't be good news for when our electric bill comes.<br /><br />It is very slow to print, which is acceptable considering the price.  The wireless networking feature doesn't work like it's supposed to, and we tried every which way to set it up.<br /><br />One major annoyance is that I lose the device status/connectivity every time I shut down or reboot my pc.  We've got it hardwired to the network, and everything's perfectly fine until I have to reboot/power down my computer. When I power back up, the device shows as being "Offline", even though the printer is on. The printer is still listed under "Devices & Printers", but until I reinstall it, it will continue to show it as offline.<br /><br />But, if you don't mind the power drain, wax transfer, high replacement toner cost, and using the printer directly connected to your pc via usb, it's definitely the printer to buy.  Me?  I wouldn't buy it again & wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.;;2.0;;January 30, 2012;;8;;8;;1.0

I had planned to purchase the Pro9500 but was researching the differences that made it worth the higher price tag. Two friends have the Pro9000 and they think it's great. I've personally used a 6700D for sometime after switching from HP to Canon. The 6700D has been a great 8x10 photo printer. I read several reviews on HP, Epson & Canon... found a few great reviews... the iPhoto comparison of all 3 brands and similar models was very helpful and the Pro9000 and Pro9500 iPhoto reviews were a great comparison too. Since the Pro9000 was reviewed at several sights to produce better results on ProPaper Gloss than the Pro9500; and the Pro9500 didn't do better in color prints using the better inks (again per several reviews), and the only area of improvement was the grey scale B&W prints (inks & number of inks)... the 3 times greater price wasn't justified to me! Besides, I'm considering a large format printer in the near future.... which would perform the same duty as the Pro9500 with much larger prints, so the choice of Ink wasn't as vital to me.<br /><br />I did a few prints and decided the OEM and various photo app profiles were not satisfactory, so I had several papers custom profiled by InkJetArt for the Pro9000 similar to the profiles for the 6700D.<br />After this was done, the prints were outstanding... very satisfied.<br />Since then, I've learned of a new Spyder3 Suite (monitor & printer) profiling system is now availble at a home-price value... so I'll be trading in my EyeOne Display2 for the Spyder3 Suite to obtain additional profiles.<br /><br />Overall, the speed, noise and quality are all better than expected... so I would confidently recommend the Canon Pro9000 to any serious amature or pro in search of this caliber of printer. If it continues to perform, like the little brother 6700D... it'll be a great purchase & value.<br />In addition, with the money saved in comparison to the Pro9500... I can add another Lens to my camera bag for more enjoyment!!;;5.0;;October 31, 2007;;9;;9;;1.0

I travel weekly and often need the use of a printer and so the purchase of the Canon seemed timely and has proven to be a wonderful printer. I admit I also purchased the Bluetooth option and the extended batter as well so the total cost of this bundle was right around 400.00. This is a bit pricy but after using the printer dozens of times I have no regrets for purchasing the printer or the wireless and extended battery options. The printer is easy to use, quiet and prints both color and b&w documents quickly and with very very good quality. I printed an 8x11" photo on old color paper from a small image and got very impressive results. B&W documents are crisp and of an excellent quality. What else do you want from a printer. Easy, quiet, quick and sharp quality prints!<br /><br />The bluetooth and extended battery options are by no means necessary but I have bluetooth and love that I don't have to carry a bunch of cables and battery charger every time I travel. The extended battery lasts a long long time. I wish I could say exactly how many hours but I have printed at least 300 pages and never had to recharge, even when the printer was not in use for more than a week.<br /><br />I carry my laptop and printer in a laptop backpack and even with magazines, ipods, files and the other stuff we carry around the printer feel lightweight and doesn't add a trmendous extra weight to the pack.<br /><br />Cartridge use seems adequate and I have yet to replace a cartridge. Installation of them is easy as is the installation of the software.<br /><br />I give this printer a 5 star because if has exceeded my expectations of a small, lightweight travel printer, that I also use at home. I would dfeinitely purchase this printer again.;;5.0;;March 15, 2006;;75;;76;;0.986842

It broke within three months (continued to report that there was no paper loaded, despite there being plentiful paper there).  HP was good about replacing it promptly.  It prints text FAST.  The problem is getting to the point that it has started printing.  As others have mentioned, it takes this printer eons to initialize.  Sometimes, it even decides to reset at completely random times.  And the noise...you'd think it was about to spew plastic and metal parts out the paper hole with the intensity of churning and grinding you hear.  Then there is the continued "finickiness" with regard to loading paper.  You've got to position it just right or suffer the blinking "paper out" light.<br /><br />And then there is the ink.  As others have mentioned, there was a class action suit against HP because they didn't make it clear how ink was used by certain printers.  This causes most users to go through their colored ink faster than they should.  For example, with this printer, even though you may be printing a simple black and white text document, you have to click through four settings (Properties/Features/Print in grayscale/Black Ink Only) to ensure that no colored ink is used in printing your simple black and white document.<br /><br />The things this printer gets right (solid wireless performance straight out of the box and fast printing) are vastly overshadowed by all the hassle we've had to go through to get things done.<br /><br />Again, as others have mentioned, HP denies all allegations yet has settled the suit.  Because of my personal experience with this "feature", we will be avoiding HP products in the future.;;2.0;;January 6, 2011;;6;;6;;1.0

I got this to replace a USB laser printer which I had plugged into a USB port on my router-- always an unreliable way to do it, it would stop working every couple of months and I'd have to reboot stuff or reinstall it. And there's no substitute for a good old solid b&w laser printer. The ink doesn't have to dry like with inkjet, nozzles don't clog, and text quality is better and it's faster and cheaper per page than a color laser. It just works, all the time.<br /><br />Double-sided printing should be a requirement for anyone who prints documents. And you get a built-in scanner with document feeder, and copier.<br /><br />This is the only b&w laser printer of any kind that supports AirPrint, which lets you print directly from an iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad, without any computer involved. The printer appeared automatically on my iPod Touch, I chose if I wanted to print double-sided and how many copies, and that's it-- worked perfectly without any configuration. Handy for printing articles or maps when you don't feel like booting up your computer, or for using your iPod Touch or iPad at home and leaving your laptop at the office. The printouts look pretty much exactly like printouts from a normal Mac.<br /><br />You do have to upgrade the printer's firmware once to add the AirPrint feature. You download that upgrade from HP's website. The upgrade can be done painlessly from a Mac, and works over the network.<br /><br />In addition to being the only b&w laser with AirPrint, there are also not too many b&w laser all-in-ones out there, and not too many laser all-in-ones that can print double-sided.<br /><br />Printing from the Mac, including double-sided printing, also works perfectly without any software installation-- you can skip the included CD. It's a PostScript printer, which even nowadays helps some fonts print more correctly under some circumstances.<br /><br />You can also scan from the Mac without installing any software, using Apple's Preview or Image Capture applications. Both the automatic document feeder and the flatbed work perfectly. Note: This applies to Snow Leopard, the latest version of OS X. On my roommate's older Mac with Leopard, we had to download the HP printer driver and scanning software, which was easy enough and worked fine.<br /><br />A networked scanner is also convenient because you can share it among multiple computers, and it doesn't have to be near your computer.<br /><br />This all-in-one's only functional shortcoming is that you can't press a button on the scanner to scan directly to some computer, like you can with some Brother all-in-one's, for example. That feature is only really a time-saver when you're scanning multiple pages of a book, since you can't use the automatic document feeder so you'd have to go back and forth to the computer for every page. Or potentially with any object that you need to hold flat, if you've located the scanner at a distance from your computer. Making a copy on the printer and then scanning the copy with the document feeder could be a workaround, but wastes paper. Or put your computer near the scanner/printer.<br /><br />Scan quality is not necessarily top-notch, but it seems fine for documents and it's fast enough. Especially with the document feeder, scanning a multi-page document at 300dpi in grayscale to a PDF is very fast.<br /><br />Since this is a b&w laser, copying really works just like a copy machine. It's very fast.<br /><br />Compared to the slightly more professional b&w LaserJet P2015dn we have at the office, this printer is a little louder printing, but maybe a touch softer and faster at duplexing. Unlike the 2015, this printer doesn't have expandable memory. Also unlike the 2015, this printer doesn't have a fully enclosed input paper tray, or an optional straight paper path out the back. Print quality seems more or less similar.<br /><br />Warm-up times, both for scanning and printing, are fast. The first page comes out quickly and subsequent pages are fast too.<br /><br />I find the industrial design pretty ugly, but its footprint is small for the features, especially the depth. It is pretty tall and maybe a couple inches wider than it really needs to be. In general HP has a lot of experience with this stuff, and even if all the parts don't look luxurious, they work well. Overall this printer is a great value for the essential features you get.;;4.0;;February 20, 2011;;14;;15;;0.933333

The printer produces a static noise, the equivalent of having a radio with the volume way up but not connected to any station.  I have replaced this  printer thinking that maybe it was a manufacturing issue, but it looks like a design flaw.  I'm sure HP wanted to ship this part fast, and didn't care about the quality.  I'll leave any updates to this review if this printer issue is resolved.<br /><br />I also found this on HP's web site to where it's called "TotalCare."  You be the judge of this:<br /><br />"Printers will make a little noise, but if you think that the noise is abnormal you can call our technical support at 800-474-6836 . They will be able to fully diagnose the noise. If it is found to be an abnormal noise they can setup a replacement for you."<br /><br />This reply was by an HP employee, who is also a PhD student.  I'm sure that any PhD student has spent some time around a printer to know that it doesn't just hiss all the time.  Especially while the printer is on idle.  Maybe it'll hiss for whatever reason while it's printing.  It gets especially annoying if the printer is located in an office, which is quiet.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />This printer has software so awful,that it's hard to even find the option to be able to print photos.  Even worse, after I started printing photos, after the 10th one, they are all bad.  One of the colors is gone, and won't come back.  I now have ruined photos along with bad software, along with the crazy hissing noise.<br /><br />If you buy something from a company like HP, its supposed to work right out of the box.

I noted some reviewers complained about the noise however this printer is extremely quiet for a printer. And, of course, my mother was shocked at how quiet it is in comparison to the old printer. She's thrilled beyond belief at the speed in which it prints, again comparing it to the old printer, which took 3-5 minutes to print one page depending on color and graphics.

In route work, you need to be able to hand out a map on the spur of the moment.  This printer is a much needed answer for our supervisors' requirements.  Running on a battery means no power concerns or cord tangles and trip hazards out there alongside the truck when the tailgate of the truck is made an instant desk.  With the optional bluetooth or wifi configuration, (all three configurations are available on this unit) you have no cords at all.  Just pull it out, turn it on, load some paper and you're ready to print.  It spits out pages in good quality at up to 22 pages per minute, prints in color or grayscale, and does it with no fussing about.  Not bad performance for an office printer much less a battery operated, no wires printer on the tailgate of a truck.  I logged onto the HP website to download the drivers from the net rather than the included discs because we're using netbook computers to command the printer, so no optical drives are in these computers.  HP's site was easy to navigate and the drivers were easy to find and the download went without any hitches, plus HP sent me an email after this visit and registration to have me review their service.  Seems like they care about the customer experience though I didn't have any issues which would have required any special assistance.  That's kind of the ideal, isn't it?<br /><br />The only negative I have for this unit is the price of the ink cartridges.  However, weighing the cost of ink against the convenience of easy loading cartridges and the cost of having team members wandering around neighborhoods looking for a specific street this is much more cost effective.;;5.0;;January 10, 2010;;8;;8;;1.0

The printer was then finally able to access the paper and quit giving me the "paper tray is empty" notice.<br /><br />After that, it began working fine. No thanks to HP customer support. The techs, who I presume were in India, were absolutely unaware of this model of printer, and couldn't figure out to suggest a different weight of paper. I admit, I may not have been very receptive to this suggestion, but it was never offered as a solution to the 'out of paper' problem I struggled with for the first 4 hours of trying to get this printer through it's initial setup. Usually a suggestion such as this is a desperate attempt to move the problem somewhere else. In this case it worked.<br /><br />Now the only problem is the e-print feature, which is still not working. The printer has it's own email address, and will print anything that is attached to the email. Right now, the system cannot send an email to my printer. No one knows why.<br /><br />The scanning to a network folder is a wonderful feature. With the document feeder, it is easy to scan documents to a folder on your computer, then you can rename them, and keep archival copies of documents.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with the printer, but quite dissappointed with HP support.;;4.0;;November 16, 2010;;19;;20;;0.95

I am a serious amateur photographer and I want my photos to look good when printed.<br /><br />The MP510 did a good job, but the prints that I am getting now from the ix6520 are much better.  I could not be more pleased.  And now I even have the option of going as big as 13x19 for a few photos I'm especially proud of and would like to display in a prominent location in my home.<br /><br />Set up of the printer is easy thanks to the documentation that comes with the printer.  Both in writing and in drawings it takes you through the set up process step by step.<br /><br />I suppose I hurried a bit because I ran  into trouble near the end because I neglected to turn a page before running the set up disk.  Early in the process I was instructed to turn on the printer, so when I came to run the set up disk I immediately started it, but had I turned the page before doing so I would have seen that if the printer was on it should be turned off before starting the disk.  I finally figured out why I was not getting a proper installation and went back and repeated a few steps, but I thought I should mention it here in the hopes that I will prevent someone from making the same mistake I did.<br /><br />The other thing that needs to be mentioned is that no USB cable comes with the printer.  However, if you are replacing a printer, as I was, then just use the cable from the old printer.  Otherwise you will need to obtain a cable before you can connect the printer to the computer.<br /><br />Compatible ink with a chip is available,, which is important unless you have an unlimited budget.<br /><br />Good software comes with the printer.  One of the first things I did was  go to the Canon US support page to see if there were any updates to the software even though the printer is relatively new.  There were a couple, which I downloaded and installed.  It is not uncommon with new products to have upgrades in the software soon after  release as the manufacturer gets word from users about bugs, etc.  So if you get the printer, I would recommend downloading the updates for the software.  I had some trouble finding the printer on the Canon Support and Drivers page to find out if there were upgrades because the printer was not showing up on the list I used with the previous printer.  Here is how you do it for the IX6520:  Support And Drivers>Consumer and Home Office>Printers and Multifunction>PIXMA Corporate & Graphics Art Printers>PIXMA IX6520.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have been using the printer for about 6 weeks and am even more positive than when I wrote the review.  I have been using it mainly to print photos, but also to copy downloaded user manuals for some of the photo editing software I use.  It does an excellent job with both, but the photos are what I am most fussy about and I could not be more pleased.  I do not think I would get better prints if I used the services of one of the websites that make prints.  The quality of the prints is far better than what I was getting with my previous Canon printer.<br /><br />Regarding ink, an important consideration when buying a printer.  All the the colored ink cartridges have by now been replaced by much less expensive cartridges (with chip) purchased from abacus24-7, in some cases more than once, however, I can see no change in the quality of the printed photos.  I have used their ink for several years with good results and the same is true with this printer.  The only difference I can see between the photos printed with the Canon cartridges and those I am using now is the price.;;5.0;;October 13, 2011;;17;;18;;0.944444

Buying the Kodak, with all the bells and whistles, wasn't much more expensive that buying ink for my HP that didn't have WiFi, scanner, copier, etc.  This printer is great except for two issues.<br /><br />(1)  I have a Netgear router and I have had issues keeping the Kodak's WiFi connected.  I did discover a work around which is to unplug it and plug back in to power.  The WiFi will automatically reset, and it will work for a while.  Trying to reconnect the WiFi through the printer setup was a disaster, but the total re-boot works.<br /><br />(2)  I primarily print text documents, but the color cartridge seems to deplete at the same rate.  I agree with others that the price break on ink is an illusion, unless there is a way to stop the use of the color unless I really need it.  The two pack of the color and black is a reasonable cost, and is certainly less than HP.<br /><br />It seems that ink costs is the way that printer companies make money, and it pisses me off.;;3.0;;December 12, 2010;;5;;5;;1.0

Print heads were the problem.  For some reason, they kept wearing out on me and the printer won't print properly when that happens.  Shouldn't have to replace print heads every six months, which is what I was having to do with it.  My mother has had her Epson for years and not once has she had to replace print heads.<br /><br />There is so much about this Kodak printer to like.  It is really nice to be able to use a printer you don't have to keep under constant watch while it's printing, which I had to do with the Lexmark.  I also like the fact that when a cartridge runs out, it immediately stops printing and tells you so.  My other one would just keep going and I'd come back to find funky colors or blank pages.  The Kodak also gives you ink levels in real time so that you know when it's going to run out if you're paying attention.  Hover your mouse over the little ink icons and it'll give you what percentage is left.<br /><br />I've been using this printer for a couple of months now.  I print 30 copies a week of a church bulletin on two sheets of legal size paper, front and back, with both text and pictures. I did notice that the ink went pretty fast but then the copies were so dark, even on draft.  I lightened the font color and it does a little better but if you're printing pictures as well as text and the pictures have a lot of dark colors, the black is going to go a bit faster that you'd think.  Now, I'm getting about the same yield as out of the other printer's non-XL ink and the ink for this one is about half what I was paying for the other.  I notice that Kodak also has XL versions of the black and color inks and they're also about half of what I was paying for the Lexmark XL ink so I think this has been a good deal all the way around.;;5.0;;March 24, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

Also, the scanner is problematic.  Initially I had no problem scanning multi-page documents to a file.  Now the darn machine will only give me individual JPEGs, not PDFs, and refuses to recognize the existence of my PC, and won't therefore allow me to create a file for a multi-page document when scanning.  The PC and the Panasonic are connected via the USB cord and I can print perfectly well, so I don't understand what the problem is.  If I only had the strength to throw the thing out the window.  This is a nightmare.<br /><br />[Three months into the ordeal]  More drawbacks come to light ... I received a cheery e-mail offering me a great deal on a replacement "drum cartridge" - a snip at $91.32!  I have never known a printer that required a replacement drum cartridge, but I'm suspecting that Panasonic have arranged for the drum cartridges in these babies to die young, so that one is forced into buying a new drum cartridge as well as toner (which is not cheap either).  And talking about toner, the initial cartridge that came with the machine died after only a couple of hundred pages and - whadya know? - the machine seems to be rigged so that you have to replace the toner because otherwise the answering machine does not work - it flashes that there is a message there, but wouldn't play it until I had loaded the replacement toner.  Sneaky!  I am going to buy a cheapo stand alone HP printer and use that ($30 including toner, which is cheaper than the toner for the Panasonic alone) ... this is crazy, really, really crazy.  I would advise anyone against buying this machine.<br /><br />(3.5 months, and things still not looking up).  I loaded the replacement toner cartridge a couple of weeks ago - all of a sudden copies are coming out with big black smudges on them - can't figure out how to stop that happening.  And I had another baffling session with those instructions recently, trying to figure out how to access the voicemail from a remote location.  Oh, and the scanner is going through a temperamental phase - I send documents to scan.  it sucks them through at its usual glacier speed and then happily announces something along the lines of "It did not scan!"  And indeed, it did not.<br /><br />Is anyone from Panasonic reading this stuff?  If so, do they care?  Probably not ...;;1.0;;November 27, 2011;;16;;17;;0.941176

In fact, I was considering a Deskjet 3520 with its monochrome display, but the store guy [it took me talking to two people to get enough information] convinced me that this was a better unit. It used the #564 cartridges, which were a lot more economical, at $10/ea. than the #78 cartridge for the old 970. OK, there were now 4 ink cartridges, but I don't see using that much colored ink, just mainly black.<br /><br />  Brought the printer home, hooked it up, and it ran flawlessly! Did 120 sheets of black [mostly]/red/blue printing, and the ink status gauges barely moved. This printer just spits out the sheets in draft mode...really fast!<br /><br />  Tried a photo from the internet on plain paper, and it was great. Using the 4 x 6 sample pack of photo paper that came with the printer, I printed a photo from the hard disc of the PC that was outstanding. The camera mamory slot on the printer will not take my XD memory card, but I can load them into the PC, as I have been doing. This stuff would use up the colored inks, I know, if I make a habit of it.<br /><br />  The printer will give a status report if asked, and even print out a sudoku puzzle, or calendar, or even notepaper/ graphpaper.  The copying feature is new to me, and will prove useful...it will even do a decent job duplicating old photos, either on plain paper, or photo paper.

Its print speed is slightly faster, and they've added some new cleaning features that I now don't know how I did without. That being said, it's basically the same printer (it even uses the same print head as the earlier model), and some of my main complaints about it were not addressed with the update.<br /><br />The Pros: This is truly a professional grade printer which I have used heavily for several months. I produce prints of my artwork sometimes at the rate of three or four hundred 8x10's a week, and at other times it sits idle for a week or two at a time. The color quality with genuine canon inks is incredible - in my experience requiring little to no calibration with a properly set up, quality monitor. While printing, it's quick and quiet, even without its special Quiet Mode enabled, and I have actually turned down its printing speed at times, to allow for more drying time between prints. If you need to print very high quality, medium-large format pictures (whether photos or art) at reasonably high volume, this printer is definitely a good choice.<br /><br />The Cons: This may not be a good printer for someone who intends to use it only a few times a year, as it does use large amounts of ink in its cleaning cycles, and if you leave it sitting too long it will require several. What seems to be lacking more than the printer itself is the software it comes with - most irritating is its lack of support for 11x14" paper, a standard print and photo size readily available on one of my previous printers, an Epson Stylus Photo 1280. Its batch printing program, Easy-PhotoPrint, also limits paper type selection based on paper size - perhaps useful if printing only with Canon's paper, but in my experience it handles other brands just as well. Points that others have brought up about its size are more or less accurate - it is a behemoth. Instead of sitting next to my computer, it has the top of a shelving unit all to itself, and will overwhelm most desktop space. It also requires space behind and in front for those big 13x19" prints you'll be producing.<br /><br />All in all, the good points of this printer far outweigh the bad, but for a very select number of people. If you're printing only letter sized, there are other printers in Canon's line that do the job just as well. If you print infrequently, a laser printer might be a better option, as it doesn't have heads that will clog. If you frequently need to print larger than 13x19" (it also has no banner printing feature), you'd be better with an actual large format printer. If you are an independent artist, artist group, or small photography studio, however, I would definitely recommend this printer.;;4.0;;December 2, 2009;;50;;52;;0.961538

We have been using the 7250 for about 1 month. I would reccomend following the instructions provided by the 7250 for setup in the order they are written, I did and had no problems setting the printer up. For the 7250 there are a lot of plastic packing protectors to be removed, but the 7250 setup instructions gives you step by step process to remove all packing tapes and protectors. When you place the ink cartridges in, it is a bit disconcerting cause you have to use a pretty good amount of downward force on the in cartridge such that it "snaps" into the ink cartridge carousel in the 7250. When placeing the ink cartridge the instructions indicate there will be a loud snap indicating proper seating, one of the ink cartridges produced a loud snap, the other one (can't remember which one) produced a "quiet" snap. The wireless connectivety connection was a breeze, again I would reccomend following the Kodak provided instructions. The Kodak 7250 LCD readout while establishing connectivity was informative and pretty intuitive, but you do have to know about WiFi a little bit (this comment is true for any WiFi device not just the Kodak 7250).<br /><br />The one thing on the setup the 7250 did which was a bit unexpected was immediately download new firmware. This wasn't a problem and the 7250 loaded and installed the new firmware without a hitch but if you buy a 7250 make sure you have Internet connectivity availability for the printer immediately. Also (FYI) WHILE the printer is updating it's firmware it is IMPORTANT to make sure you DO NOT power down the printer, other wise you will have to send the printer back to the manufacturer to get re-flashed. For me I had no problems downloading and installing the new firmware, but I thought I would warn non-technical people and instruct them of this.<br /><br />The WiFi connectivity of the printer turned out to be a real advantage, much more than I thought it would be. The main reason is that the printer can be located conviently anywhere and doesn't have to be located near the computer or/and a ethernet port. Also if you have a big print job, you can temporarily locate it to other convenient work locations such as your kitchen table where you can edit with your laptop and then print right away. Another REAL advantage of the WiFi is that the printer is setup to be a network printer, in other words you do NOT have to tie it to a computer and then have that computer slow down when someone else on the network is printing on the printer.<br /><br />The printing is a bit subdued but acceptable, this comment applies to normal paper, I have heard that if you use Kodak paper the printing is excellent. In the future I probably will goto Kodak paper, one reason is the Kodak paper has invisible alignment marks which the 7250 can read which should mean it will automatically align the paper or/and print head.<br /><br />Reviews which state the printer is loud are true. Kodak needs to reduce the noise by at least 1/2 or more. My old printer, an Epson, you could not hear it print from downstairs the Kodak 7250 you definitely can hear it from downstairs. I do not know if the noise is generated from the print head or/and the paper handler but it is noisy. I would say though that the increased noise level of the 7250 is tolerable, it was just unexpected and noticeable and compared to other printers is on the loud side. One advantage of the noise is you know your print job is printing and when it is done, which is relatively quick. It is because of the loudness of the 7250 that I didn't give the 7250 a perfect score, I took one star away. The loudness is tolerable and IMO should NOT deter anyone from buying or recommending the 7250, it is though on the high side compared to other printers.<br /><br />A REAL ADVANTAGE of buying the Kodak 7250 over the 5250 is the auto-duplexer and is the main reason I bought the 7250 versus the 5250. The auto-duplexer allows the 7250 to automatically print on both sides of the paper, in other words if you print on both sides of the paper your paper cost are 1/2 versus a printer which doesn't print on both sides, this is one reason I figure I can afford to buy real Kodak paper in the future. I don't understand why Kodak and other reviews do not highlight this feature, it is a cost saving as well as a very nice feature. To print on both sides, when the printer window comes up you have to goto Preferences, then select Layout tab and then on the Layout page within the "Two Sided" box select "Automatically with Duplexer". The 7250 will then automatically print on both sides of the paper, even here you can see that the 2 sided printing capability is buried (you have to hunt for it), not only this but few people will know to select "Automatically with Duplexer" function when they want two-sided printing. I am here to say that the Kodak ESP 7250 DEFINITELY does automatic two-sided printing.<br /><br />The bottom line I would reccomend buying the Kodak ESP 7250 printer, overall it's low operation cost (low ink cost & double sided printing), feature set and ease of operation makes it one of the best if not the best overall choise on the market. Also if you want excellent color you can use Kodak paper (though admittedly I haven't tried it I am relying on other reviews), the noise though is a bit excessive but I would say tolerable (still I would encourage Kodak to reduce the noise on future models)<br /><br />Added Later (1/14/2011)<br />The 7250 contines to drop the Wifi connection, it will maintain connection for about 8 hours then drop the connection. The ONLY way I can get it to reconnect is to power cycle the printer and the wireless router at the same time. I am pretty sure this is a firmware problem with how Kodak maintains Wifi connection or how they recconnect after a Wifi connection drop. We have 3 laptops in the house they all connect, reconnect and maintain Wifi connection with our DLink wireless router. I have web chatted with Kodak support and she told me it was a KODAK AiO Software problem and that I need the latest version, however I found out I have the latest version 5.4.6.4 (she stated this application would download the latest firmware). Not sure what to do, turning on/off the printer every day to print is a pain. BTW I have tried power cycling the printer by itself, turning off/on the Wifi and reentering my WPA2 key, NONE of this works. The ONLY thing that works is power cycling the printer at the same time I power cycle the wireless router, strong indication that the printer Wifi firmware needs to be corrected. If Kodak fixes this problem (and they should be able to, they just need to consult with someone who actually knows Wifi) this printer would be awesome. As is it is a headache, Kodak needs a Wifi communication expert. This problem IS NOT a user problem.<br /><br />1/16/2011<br />Ok, I think I have solved the Wifi problem. I had my Dlink on 20/40MHz, not only did this cause problems with linking and maintaining linking to the Kodak 7250 but it also caused my son's MACBOOKPRO to have problems to connect the our Wifi. Changing the Dlink Channel BW to just 20MHz seems to have solved the Wifi problem, the printer now connects and maintains connection thus far.<br /><br />The 2nd thing is DO NOT Update the firmware if you are connected by Wifi, ONLY update the Kodak 7250 firmware if you are connected by USB. This seems to address people who's printer was working fine but were Wifi connected and then updated the firmware. If the link should get dirupted your 7250 may lose it's brains. BEFORE updating ANY firmware make sure you have the printer connected to a WIRED interconnect to the Internet, again DO NOT UPDATE FIRMWARE of the 7250 by Wifi, this could cause problems. BTW Kodak Aio Home Center told me to update the printer firmware today, I did this while the printer was connected by Wifi. I thought the firmware update was garbaged up cause the printer stayed on and I couldn't turn it off by the power button. So I unplugged the printer and then I read the Help section in Kodak Aio Home Center, the firmware update SPECIFICALLY tells you NOT to update the firmware through Wifi, it specifically tells you to ONLY do a firmware update through USB connection to internet (a wire connection). You would think that Kodak AIO Home Center would check to see if the printer is connected by Wifi before allowing a firmware update. Long story short appears I was lucky and the printer downloaded the firmware update through my Wifi connection, but I will not update the firmware through Wifi again, this is playing Russian Roulette with your printers brains.<br /><br />Some other Wifi suggested settings:<br />1. Have DHCP enabled.<br />2. Have Wifi b,g and n enabled<br />3. Enable Auto Channel Scan<br />4. Make sure you have plenty of DHCP address range, I allow 100 IP addresses to be defined.<br />5. Fix the IP address for the printer on the router, as well as other often connected computers.<br /><br />Looks like the Kodak 7250 is a fine printer. I will post if I start having Wifi connection problems, but I am pretty sure they are solved.<br /><br />Avoid using 20/40MHz setting, this seems to be problematic for some devices trying to connect to a Wifi router, note a 40MHz channel automatically reduces the number of available channels by 1/2, which is not good.<br /><br />1/17/2011<br /><br />Just got an email from Kodak support, to their credit they essentially admitted they had a Wifi problem, to correct this they released new firmware to make the Wifi connection more stable, below is a copy from Kodak's website with the revision which was released to make the Wifi connection more stable:<br /><br />******************** Kodak Web Info Begin *********************<br /><br />KODAK ESP 7250 All-in-One Printer Firmware - WINDOWS Operating Systems<br />Published 10/05/2010 01:45 AM  |  Updated 01/14/2011 03:20 PM  |  Answer ID 17477 This version of firmware helps improve the wireless (Wi-Fi) connection stability, and helps optimize settings for improved printing, scanning, and copying.<br /><br />  Before downloading, print or write down the installation instructions below.<br /><br />Version 3.1<br /><br />Release Date 2011-01-14<br /><br />File Name FirmwareFlashLauncher.exe<br /><br />File Size 36 kilobytes<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />System Requirements<br /><br />Operating System Compatibility WINDOWS 7, WINDOWS VISTA, WINDOWS XP<br />Processor Speed PENTIUM II, 233 MHz<br />Memory 128 MB minimum<br />Hard Disk Space 10 megabytes<br />Language Support French, Dutch, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, English<br /><br />********************** Kodak Web Info End *********************************<br /><br />Doing a Google search on:<br /><br />KODAK ESP 7250 All-in-One Printer Firmware<br /><br />will bring up the web URL with the firmware update for Windows.<br /><br />1/23/2011:<br />There seems to be secondary connection issues, like the Kodak driver on the PC not recognizing the printer if it changes IP address (reboot of router). To overcome this reserve (fix) the IP address the router gives the Kodak 7250. In general fixing the IP address (reserving it) seems to help the LAN side of the connection to have less problems as well as recognition of other computers is quicker.<br /><br />There seems to be a bug in the latest version of firmware IF you do a maintenance printing while the printer is in deep sleep mode, maintenance printing will lock up the printer if done from deep sleep mode. Kodak maintenance printing is accessed by clicking open the Kodak printer in the system tray, clicking on the wrench at the top of the window, and then clicking "Print Test Page". Do NOT click on "Print Test Page" if the printer is in deep sleep mode. If the printer is in wake-up mode it prints the maintenance page OK. Also FYI the printer prints normal print job requests (non-maintenance printing) OK from deep sleep, there is no issue with "normal" print requests.;;4.0;;December 29, 2010;;18;;19;;0.947368

I bought this printer to replace an HP printer that was almost identical in size with less functionality. The scanner on the HP died after about a year and wasn't worth the time or expense to fix. If you have previously setup a wireless printer then you will find that removing the packaging and tape strips requires nearly as much time as getting the printer online and printing. It does not come with any USB cable but such is not necessary for setup with a wireless router. I visually scanned the quick start guide and found that setup was very intuitive. I did need to view the picture that shows the proper orientation of the ink cartridges. Be careful to read and follow the instructions for unpacking the ink cartridges and make sure that you only remove the one strip and not the little plastic cover where the ink exits the cartridge. This will be pierced while inserting the cartridges into the printer. Installing the software was easy and I quickly had both of ours laptops connected to the printer and properly functioning. The total time to install the printer, install the software on two laptops, and configure everything was less than 60 minutes.<br /><br />All of the features are as specified by the manufacturer. I like the 30-page document feeder. I also like the feature that allows you to remotely enable and disable FAX auto-answer mode. This may be accomplished from any enabled network printer. You may also send a FAX directly from any enabled, network connected PC.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Quick and easy setup<br />* Versatile 30-page document feeder<br />* Fully compatible with Windows 7<br />* Ability to wirelessly setup and control all functions.<br />* I find that the color LCD, keypad, and menu structure are very useful and intuitive.<br />* I have had no issues remotely printing even when the printer is in "sleep mode." The printer recovers faster than the HP predecessor that it replaced.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />* The printer is not as noisier as the HP printer it replaced. I wouldn't install either in my bedroom.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* I agree with others that the paper tray is flimsy but, with care, it may last as long as the printer's useful lifetime.;;5.0;;March 11, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

It is a dream compared to the old HP printer that I had replaced for setup and ease of use.  My primary use is for printing, scanning and copying on standard paper and it is one of the easiest to set up and use that I have found.  I did compare this printer with the HP7510 (which is the same price) at a store and chose this one because it has the ability to fax, has the ability to use an ethernet cable (unlike many of the newer wireless printers) and because the ink for this printer was almost 40% less than the HP7510 (assuming the page volumes for the ink cartridges are comparable).<br /><br />The only difficulties that I have had was the eprint setup took several attempts.  Not sure if this was a problem with the printer or a problem with the webservice.  However, the printer seemed to lock up during this process.  After turning the printer on/off and retrying several times, it finally did complete and printout a code to enter into the eprint service setup.  The webservice then allows one to choose your printer's email address.  The manual was not particularly helpful in giving instructions on how to complete this process.  The eApps are cool.<br /><br />The second issue that I had with this printer is the double sided printing feature.  The manual again was not particularly helpful.  After inserting the duplexer, one must also ensure that it is enabled under the customize settings/device settings section as well as choosing a double sided option under the properties when printing.  However, I still have occasions when printing from pdf files where the printer only prints single sided.  Another note is that the document feeder on top with the scanner is only able to scan single sided.<br /><br />However, I am very impressed by this product thus far!;;5.0;;December 9, 2011;;42;;44;;0.954545

I have had this printer for over a year and never been more frustrated by an electronic device. It has the following faults: Rapid depletion of ink cartridges, you will be buying these color cartridges by the case load and it will be VERY expensive. You will use colored ink even if you try NOT to as you can NOT select B&W to avoid the color when you do not need it. (there is a black cartridge among the colored ones that will go first even though another separate black is there also - stupid and redundant). Document feed is a joke - it never works and you will lose your mind hand feeding it so faxing becomes useless beyond a single page. Scanning is unreliable as the connection drops out and each page must be manually placed on the scanner as the feed is again lousy.<br />So really every feature is a non-feature and really just a source of frustration.<br />Look elsewhere for a flexible system - this is NOT it.

Photos print out nice and clear on a variety of medium ranging from photo paper to watercolor paper.  I only use this printer for photo printing, I have a laser printer for everyday text and office type jobs.<br /><br />Something to keep in mind is that this printer is optimized for photo printing.  The Claria ink is a step above the standard entry-level inks in that it's designed to be color fast for ~100 years and have less light fade and other longevity issues.  For this reason ink costs a little more for this printer, but you do get what you pay for.<br /><br />In summary - this is an excellent entry level photo printer.  The Claria inks are good (probably the best in this price category).  The next step up would be something like an R1900 - wide format and pigment based Ultrachrome inks.  However, if you are mainly printing labels, text documents, and other general home/office tasks this may not be the best choice as your only printer.<br /><br />Edit:  March, 2009<br /><br />I still say this is a great home photo printer, but I have since upgraded to an Epson 2400 and the output of the 2400 is considerably higher quality.

Unfortunately, for actually printing it is the worst printer we have owned.  There are numerous issues with printing from OS X Lion, many of which HP seems to be aware of as they have been commented on in the HP support forums for many months.  Example issues:<br />-  Printer loses connection with the Mac (this appears to be an issue with both OS X Snow Leopard and with Lion).  HPs solution is uninstall the printer and reinstall it, which does resolve the issue UNTIL the next time you go to print, and once again you have to uninstall and reinstall the printer.<br />- Changing simple options on the print dialog (e.g. print in black & white only) results in about 80% of the page printing, and then the printer hangs with an unintelligible alpha-numeric error message that HP support doesn't even seem to be able to figure out<br />- By default the printer ships enabling automatic updates to the printer firmware if the printer is connected to the Internet.  A potentially very nice feature, which unfortunately for a fair number of users results in the printer freezing up partially through the update.  Only way to get this resolved is to ship the printer back to HP.  We were hoping that when the replacement printer arrived, the other issues would have been resolved.  Unfortunately, this new printer suffers from the same issues.  HP support did recommend that we turn off the automatic printer updates.<br /><br />Oddly, about the only thing that works reliably on this printer is printing from iPad and iPhone!  Just today after trying to print the same doc from the Mac to the HP four times with no success, I switched and printed it from the iPad.

The 'copy' function produces much better quality than our old scanner-printer configuration which used an Epson high-end scanner and a Canon Pixma printer.  The old configuration always had a light gray background which could be reduced by setting the scanner to a 'light' tone.  This produced a lighter copy which was harder to read.  The WorkForce copy function produces an excellent copy that is very readable and without the gray background that my wife hated so much.  You can do the copy function without going through the computer (your choice - can go through the computer if you want to).  That makes it faster and more convenient to do.<br /><br />Printing output is much faster than our old device.  The paper really comes flying out.<br /><br />I had considered a Kodak Hero 6.1 for the same price but the reviews for the Epson are much better, and of course, Kodak is now in bankruptcy.

This printer fit right in without any trouble.  I had the printer unboxed, on the network, and printing from my Linux machine within half an hour, including time to deal with a broken software issue on the Linux machine.<br /><br />The best bit: because of the Postscript print engine, and Konica-Minolta having the good sense to include Postscript Printer Description (PPD) files, the drivers shipped with the machine worked perfectly on my Linux computer.  If you've ever set up a Linux printer, you know that just never happens.<br /><br />If you have a simple network, this printer is probably plug and play.  With absolutely no configuration on my part my main desktop was able to connect to the printer and print.<br /><br />If you buy a network printer though, there's a good chance that you want to tweak your setup just a little bit.  It was really easy to assign a network address of my choosing instead of an automatic address.  I entered that address into my name server, and then it was trivial to connect to the printer from any machine on my network, by entering a printer server host of magicolor1650 (the host name I entered in the name server).<br /><br />It really doesn't get easier than this.  I've been setting up home networks for 15 years, and this is the easiest printer installation I've ever had.  Plug it in, tell the network about it, tell the computers about it, and it just works.

HP have the best printers on the market today. Their print quality is great and longevity of the printer is outstanding.<br />2. Make sure you have the latest version of the driver for this printer. If you use the disc that comes with the printer most likely the driver isn't the latest. Go ahead and download the new firmware from the HP website. (If using Windows and just want the latest driver, just go to windows update and it will download the latest driver for the OS you are using.)<br />3. On several occasions I have purchased the cheapest cartridge I could find and all have worked just fine with quality indistinguishable from HP's existing cartridges.<br /><br />I chose the P2055dn because of the features such as: networking, auto-duplexing and the standard size of RAM (128MB). I was initially surprised by the amount of noise the printer made with the factory default settings but after setting the printer to Quiet Mode it has been great. To set this feature, press the down arrow on the printer several times until you reach System Setup. Push the OK button, then toggle down to Quiet Mode with the down arrow. Press OK, then use the down arrow to toggle the Quiet Mode On, press OK, and press the carriage return key to go back to Ready. After making these changes, the printer runs slower but the print quality is excellent and the noise level is similar to that of any other printer.;;3.0;;July 14, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

Then the top scanner broke, so we looked for a newer model from Canon - it suits perfectly a small private practice. It scans, copies, faxes, interacts with networks, you name it... Now if only more retailers had ink supply, that would be the end of the problems. Yes, the ink is expensive, but check the load -number of copies it can produce! It's worth all of it. So if you're looking for a reliable multitasking office copier, don't go any further. I strongly recommend.

Its speed isn't its strong suit, but the print quality is magnificent. And, with very little adjusting the print colors match my screen. It is a little pricey, but for a printer that prints 13" wide, I expected to pay more. In fact when I bought the Epson 6 years ago, I paid almost $700 for it.

My HP 5550 printer was also listed as being Vista compatible and limited functionality which meant that borderless printing was not available, ink levels could not be seen, it didn't recognize the #58 photo cartridge, etc. So, I am skeptical the 460 is really Vista compatible. There is, however, evidence that HP is working on full compatibility. To be clear, I do not actually own this printer and have no basis for rating it.

For the price, it can't be beat!;;I'm impressed with this printer.  I've owned a lot of printers--way back to the Okidata Okimate printer through office PSCF machines, and this one-- especially considering the price--does a great job.<br /><br />The downside is that it's an HP, and HP is known for its horrendous level-one tech support.  That said, if you can get past the outsourced level-one support (just be tenacious & keep escalating), you can find very knowledgeable & helpful real tech support (& engineers) at HP.<br /><br />I've read the reviews from people who found this printer did not work fresh out-of-the-box.  If that happens, and you ordered it from Amazon-- return & replace through Amazon! Amazon allows you 30 days for such problems.  If your printer doesn't work, **do not go through HP support**; they'll want to replace it with a refurbished unit, which is ridiculous.  You bought a new printer; you should have a *new* printer.  This is the main reason I never buy straight through HP.  If you buy through Amazon, Amazon will take care of you.  They will issue a call tag for UPS for the non-working unit & over-night you a new one.<br /><br />This printer worked straight out-of-the box.  The set-up was amazingly simple.  However, the first time I plugged it in, the printer got stuck on its status bar and wouldn't respond.  *This event is covered in the instruction manual.*  Simply turn it off (if you can; I couldn't), unplug it from the printer and the wall.  Give it a moment to reflect on its evil ways.  Plug it back in.  Turn it on.  It worked.<br /><br />Note:  HP printers tend to become demonized when plugged into power strips.  Plug it straight into a wall receptacle.  I know--it's scary.  Just buck-up and do it.<br /><br />I followed the screen instructions.  Set up was seamless.  I can print from iPhones, iPad, my computer, across town, if I want.<br /><br />The included ink cartridges probably do not contain much ink.  The manual says its important to use the included cartridges for set-up.  (Who knows?  They probably brain wash the printer into believing that it can only use OEM cartridges.)<br /><br />The printer itself is gorgeous--a combination of shiny black with a nifty hexagon-shaped motif on the scanner lid.  I'm happy that HP finally went with black.  The institutional-looking, depressing gray got boring & old fast.<br /><br />It's not as quiet as some printers--yet not as noisy as some I've owned.  It's noise level is about average.<br /><br />The scanner works well--faster than some I've used.  The photo print quality is really quite nice for such an inexpensive printer.  For some reason, the default setting is 125% which causes photos to print too large, outside of their boundaries.  I haven't found the setting to change this yet, but you must be able to do so.  But, in the photos I printed, I can see no bars, lines, unevenness, or other nasty artifacts. The printer gives you the option of printing in color, black & white, & sepia.<br /><br />I have not tested the card reader capabilities simply because I almost never use photo cards with printers.  I have a Moshi USB card reader that works amazingly well for this purpose, so doing that function on the printer, with all the additional steps that takes, seems like an extraordinary waste of time.<br /><br />You can peruse your printer settings on your computer through the web-enabled browser functions.  This is standard for HP printers.  Just look on the printer's wireless settings & it will tell you the printer's IP address.  Point your browser there, and you can check ink levels, scan, do all kinds of entertaining stuff.<br /><br />The software-- I debated whether or not to install it.  (On Macs, you don't have to.)  But, I decided I wanted some of the features the software allows.  HP is known for its bloated, take-over-your-system software, yet the software for this printer is not nearly as huge and satanic as some HP printer software has been in the past.<br /><br />I use this printer with a super-password protected Airport Extreme connected to cable broadband.  There were no problems connecting it to the network.  I used my Pogo stylus to enter the password; this helped immensely on the tiny touch screen.<br /><br />The ink cartridges for genuine HP 564XL will run about $27.40 for the black & $23.80 (combo pack) for the cyan, magenta, & yellow cartridges.  That's pretty typical pricing, & as we all know, a huge ripoff.<br /><br />I have used third-party cartridges in HP printers with uneven results.  Some simply won't work.  Again, order from Amazon, & you can return them for a refund if they don't work.  Third-party ink is always less expensive & frequently you get more page prints from third party cartridges.<br /><br />I would (& have) recommended this printer-- especially if you have an iPad or iPhone from which you wish to print.  However, there are other ways to print from these devices by unlocking the print features in your Mac & using an Airport Extreme to connect your iPad & iPhones to the printer.  Peruse the Mac forums & you'll find instructions for going into the root level of your Mac to re-enable the print features on your Mac.  But--if you don't want to spend your time & test your nerves doing that, this printer will do it all for you effortlessly.;;5.0;;January 21, 2011;;6;;6;;1.0

The worst thing is that for Mac users in a wireless configuration, you will have to "share" your printer over the network thereby taking down your firewall.  Not a good thing from a security standpoint.<br /><br />The only other way is to use a USB connector to the printer which defeats going wireless.  Also, If you scan wireless, those documents are freely available to anyone in the area who can "tap" in.  They are not encrypted so security becomes an issue again.

Eventually, I spoke with Samung support 4 times and only after escalation did the set up work. It was incredible that none of the solutions they tried were covered in the setup guide. Why print a guide if it is completely inaccurate? One rep told me that Apple's drivers are often more successful at getting it to work (more so than Samsung's own drivers).<br /><br />Even when we got the printer installed, it would take over a minute for a page to print.

Install was simple and easy and worked wireless and USB just fine. Scan worked very well--quite fast either wireless or USB...HOWEVER...<br /><br />A day or so later the communication between print and computer through new HP Officejet 6700 Premium e-All-in-One Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax network would stop and require computer reboot to re-enable. Obviously this was unacceptable so I called HP to get resolved.  To date I have been on phone with them for over 12 hours!  During their first attempt to repair they suggested an uninstall of printer and then reinstall.  This process created a DLL error which they could not explain.  I checked web and many other have had same issue after un-install of HP software.  I fixed the problem by running CCLEANER and Glary Utilities which cleaned up all the left over mess that HP leaves after un-install.<br /><br />To make matter worse the process rendered my other all-in-on printer HP 56000 useless.  I went from a dependable 5600 and a less than ideal 6700 to not being able to print at all on either.  The case was escalated to an "Case Manager" who spent more time telling me what they would not do than he did offering solution.  He said the problem with my 5600 would not be supported because it was out of warranty--even though it worked fine before the new 6700 uninstall issue.  Unbelievable!!<br /><br />Next an "expert tech" call was scheduled where resolution was expected.  Would you believe that there system was unable to connect to my computer and then their e-mail system was not allowing outbound emails to be sent so tech could not send work around link to connect.  A tech company that can't sent emails!<br /><br />The tech went through another two hours of trying to make their software work and finally gave up and offered an upgraded model to be sent to me because he did not think the HP 6700 drivers would work--that there is an issue.  His only other solutions was for me to reformat my hard drive and reinstall operating system and all program.  Can you believe a software company can not fix there own software without having a user reformat computer and start from scratch.  That is the most unreasonable suggestion I have ever heard!<br /><br />To recap, the printer works, the software is a problem and the company should really consider learning what customer satisfaction means.  It is no wonder they are considering "remaking themselves" and exiting the hardware space.  They are failing in this area big time.;;1.0;;May 31, 2012;;83;;93;;0.892473

I have only had it a short while so I will update later this year to let you know if I still think it's a good deal.<br /><br />This thing just went on sale and at $150 I can tell you it is a good deal right now. I have been shopping around and for the price you cannot beat it.  The exception would be if you need cheaper inks.  The research says this printer will cost you more per page.  I will let you know later in the year if I feel it.<br /><br />In the meantime, let me tell you where this did not disappoint.  First, I bought this to replace my dead HP AllinOne which I had grown to hate.  It was extremely unreliable throughout its life and I swear I spent all my time fighting the software and drivers to get it to print. Also, the HP software seemed to devote itself primarily to asking me if I wanted to buy their ink from their online store or updating itself incessantly.  Drove me and my kid NUTS.  Further, sharing the wireless connection between PC's was a royal pain and we always had to release it.<br /><br />None of this is a problem with this Cannon.  I run 2 Linux and 2 Windows PC's and they all use this printer with NO problems.  I just hit print and things print. Cannon makes drivers for both the scanner and the printer features for Linux that are a breeze to install and just work immediately.  They even have different packages for different distro's.  I am an Ubuntu guy, but saw Redhat stuff too.<br /><br />If you are worried about printing speed after reading the professional reviews, stop worrying.  I have been very impressed.  This thing is faster than my "higher rated" HP.  By rating, I mean PPM as described by HP, not by reviewers.  At any rate, the 12IPM that Cannon claims translates to really fast printing on your average black and white doc.<br /><br />I have not yet taken advantage of the gorgeous photo's this thing turns out, but I am excited to do so based on reviews. Go search on 6120, 6220, 8120, 8220 on the web. They are all basically the same quality for scanning and printing.  By the way, the 8120 and 8220 are basically just photographer oriented versions that have the ability to print from film I think. Check it out. Personally that feature wasn't worth 50 bucks for me.  The smaller LCD (3 inches) makes NO difference.<br /><br />BUY IT!<br /><br />Update Jan 15, 2012. I still LOVE this printer. My daughter has had many printer intensive projects for highschool and it has performed flawlessly. I cannot tell you how valuable it is to have a printer JUST WORK when you and your kid are pulling your hair out with homework. We have since added a Macbook to the mix of clients served by this printer. Was very easy to set up and Bonjour discovered the printer right away. I did seem to have to download the Asian CUPS drivers just like I did for Linux. However, I did do it wrong so it might be even easier than that. A note on ink: It did go through that first bunch of cartridges kinda fast. However, we did a lot of printing and I never expect the cartridges that ship with printers to be a full supply. I have bought my first round of OEM cartridges and while pricey, not too much so. I still think it is well worth it for such a solid printer that prints in such gorgeous color. Also a note on speed. Some of the specs would seem to indicate it is slow compared to some HP's. I can tell you that if it's been idle for a while it does seem to take a bit of time to get 'warmed' up or calibrated. Not terrible though. And once it's in full gear, it just flies while printing. I can't compare to new HP models, but smokes my old HP All-in-One for sure. And I have it set on default quality settings. I cannot recommend Canon and this printer strongly enough.;;5.0;;November 2, 2011;;16;;16;;1.0

With photo paper the prints were quite good considering the price of the printer - they pretty much look like photo lab prints.<br /><br />What I really missed was the ability to print larger sized photos.  I used to work in a photo lab and I would spend my lunch hour printing at 20" x 30" or even larger.  Those prints really make an impact when you hang them on the wall!<br /><br />My son had been saving for a LONG time to purchase a camera and finally pulled the trigger on a Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens.  It's a great camera and he's been very happy with it.  When I helped him place the order, I noticed that there was a deal from Canon to purchase a printer together with the camera and get all but $49 back in rebate.  Why would I pass up an opportunity to get a $499 printer for $49?  So I purchased the printer and have sent in the rebate materials.<br /><br />Finally this weekend I had some time to set it up.  I cleared off a LARGE spot on a work table, and followed the instructions - un-pack the printer, install the printhead and ink cartridges, plug it in, install the software, align the heads (all automatic), and connect a USB cable (not provided for some strange reason) to my computer, and start printing photos!  It was that easy.  You will need to get yourself a USB cable like this if you order the printer...Black 10 ft Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Printer Scanner Cable Type A Male to Type B Male For HP Canon, Lexmark, Epson,<br /><br />I guess you could say I was already set to use the printer - my monitors are calibrated for proper brightness, contrast and color.  Prints made on the previous printer always matched what I saw on my screen.  So when I printed the first image, it was very satisfying to have it come out looking just like what I saw on my screen - correct brightness, contrast, and color.  I may play around with some of the settings to really fine tune it, but it was pretty much correct, right out of the box!<br /><br />So all you really need is a big space for the printer, a properly set up monitor, a USB cable, and you're ready to go.  The printer even comes with Adobe Photoshop Elements 8 included in case you don't have image editing software - that's worth more than the total cost I laid out for this package!<br /><br />Now I can make 13" x 19" borderless prints - plenty large for my purposes.  There are lots of good paper options:<br /><br />Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy II, 13 x 19 Inches, 20 Sheets (2311B026)<br />Canon Photo Paper Pro Platinum, 13 x 19 Inches, 10 Sheets (2768B018)<br /><br />And more!;;5.0;;July 9, 2011;;7;;7;;1.0

For example,  I needed to print a 30 page chapter to review and it printed all but the first 6 pages, stopped for about 30 seconds, spit out a half printed page, and then proceeded to start all over again as if it had not printed anything yet.  No error, nothing, just restart a big job.  This happens a lot - too much that I now resort to sit and watch the printer so that I don't get twice as much as I hoped for. My only recourse is to stop the print job from the computer and restart it with only the pages I need left.  This is very annoying, enough that I'm considering returning it.  If there is anyone out there with some ideas about what to do about this, I'd be happy to change my review to a 5 star.  Honestly, the printer is fast and easy to install, the duplex works flawlessly.  But, the one flaw is driving me crazy and if it is a systematic problem I would recommend considering a different printer if you plan on printing any thing beyond 20 pages long.;;1.0;;May 6, 2011;;43;;50;;0.86
R2CCGEEMLEQCIO;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1W0H6V3Y65GR2;;Printer;;B0002UM0PQ;;HP LaserJet 1320 Laser Printer;;Great SOHO printer;;This is a fantastic printer for the price (currently $250 to $300).  It is very fast, very quick to print the first page and the duplexer works well.  I think it is quiet and easy to set up.  It comes with 2 versions PCL and PS emulation, so it should work well and quickly on any print job.  Unlike laser printers of old, adding 128mb of RAM should only cost around $45.  I don't have a problem with the 1 sheet manual feed.  If you have a lot of pages to print you can change the paper in tray.  The next printer (2420) up the line includes a 150 + sheet utility tray, so that is another option as well.<br /><br />Those of you complaining about printer cables are complaining to the wrong people.  All of the manufactures would be happy to include a printer cable.  Because the perceived value of a USB cable is around $20 and they cost about $1.50 it is a good deal for HP, Canon, Epson, Samsung, etc. to include them. However, when Epson included USB cables a couple of years ago in their first all-in-one printers, that benefit only lasted one product cycle.  The retail people (Circuit City, BBY, etc.) told them to stop including cables or they wouldn't buy AIO's from Epson.  On most printers priced below $129, the stores make more money on the printer cable than on the printer.<br /><br />When you consider that the first hp LaserJet (no number) cost $2495 (when that was real money) printed 4 pages per minute when the wind was right and the stars aligned.  It had 2 resolution settings 150 and 300 dpi and had a very tough time printing graphics.  Then this printer is truly amazing by comparison.  When you buy the 49x cartridge your cost per page will be 2.2cents or less.;;5.0;;April 24, 2006;;41;;41;;1.0

When I bought the C88 (the old name for this printer), after a month it started spewing ink all over the place. A long distance call to Epson resulted in them sending me a new one. Two weeks into using the new one, my color cartridges were half full. I found this extremely odd as I only printed black text. Now, 4 weeks later, several of my color cartridges are empty, and I still haven't printed anything in color! Makes you wonder where the ink is going. Well, it isn't going anywhere. Removal of the cartridges proved that they were still full. Blowing the printer heads was no help. My black cartridges are still almost full, but I can't get the printer to print correctly, I keep getting inkless bands across my text. Blew the heads several times but it didn't help. I wrote to Epson, they answered back with their standard formatted reply: call us. Long distance, no 800 number, so we can tell you once again we will replace the printer. No thanks!

After a few weeks of research on what printer to move to and considering several Canon, Brother and Epson products I decided that the Epson 845 was probably the printer for me - and boy was I RIGHT!  I've had this printer for a little over 6 weeks and this printer is AMAZING.  I paid $199 and see it for $159 now...after using it I'd gladly pay $299.<br />Highpoints:<br />Speedy - this printer is much faster than the HP 6500 and the L7500 that I had before.<br /><br />Print Quality -  I never print photos so I can't comment on that but for business (I work from home) it is great for Powerpoint presentations and contracts.  The 2 sided printing is remarkably easy to use and actually works, something that never happened on the HP 6500.<br /><br />Wireless - I have a home office.  I and my family all use this printer.  I use it for work, my kids for school and college work.  This printer joined my wifi nework effortlessly and has given me 0 trouble.  Amazingly simpler than my previous HPs and it "warms up" in a fraction of the time my previous HP printers needed.<br /><br />Mac Compatible - I have 5 Macs that use this printer.  Using HP products I had just accepted that getting printer drivers working on a Mac required carrying the printer around the house and plugging the printer into the Mac that needed to access it was just part of the "setup process".  The Epson 845 was UNBELIEVABLY SIMPLE.  All of my Macs (2 iMacs, Macbook Pro, 2 Macbook Airs) all saw the printer on my Wifi network and immediately started working with the printer.  I have NEVER had a printer work so well with my Apple Products.  It is both Snow Leopard AND Lion compatible.<br /><br />Screen - The instrument panel is amazing.  It's HUGE, easy to see, very intuitive and actually folds away when not in use.<br /><br />Copier - Awesome!  My HPs always made "dark" copies - this one is almost perfect reproduction.  Huge upgrade.<br /><br />Low Points:<br />I only have a few items I'd improve on - not really complaints but nothing is "perfect"<br /><br />It's Big - This is not a petite printer.  I'm not sure how much they could shrink it and keep all the features but it is full figured.<br /><br />The paper trays and paper guides feel flimsy.  The printer is very light despite it's size but I am worried that I might break one of these trays or the paper guide that catches the paper as it comes out of the printer if I'm not careful.  Hasn't happened but it does worry me.  Not sure what you do if this happens.<br /><br />Bottom line - for a home / office printer, especially one shared wirelessly between multiple users this printer is an absolute DREAM!  HP - I'm never coming back.<br /><br />UPDATE - 18 June 2012<br />Still using and still LOVE this printer.  It's been over 8 months and the Epson is still the best printer I've used in years.  Reading other reviews and comments people have sent me there do seem to be two other "weak points" on this printer that I did not note above.  I have NOT seen these issues but others are commenting on them.  The weak points are 1)  I guess you can't scan without hooking it to your computer with a cable.  I don't do this - I use a small Fuji Scansnap for receipts and such and an Epson V500 for photos.  But if scanning is big for you this may be an issue.  2) Printing Pictures.  Again I have NEVER done this.  I send my pictures out to a service for printing (I use Apple) so I have no idea if it is a good photo printer or not.<br /><br />PROs - I just can't get over how well this printer works wirelessly.  I would have thrown my HPs out years ago if I knew life could be this simple!  I have NEVER had to reenter my wifi passwords or network settings.  I did it once and that was it.  Also my niece and some of my daughter's friends have needed to print here.  It was incredibly simple for them to find, install the driver, and print from my printer once I gave them my wifi password.<br /><br />Bottom Line - I would buy this pinter again in a heartbeat!;;5.0;;November 19, 2011;;358;;367;;0.975477

The up-side is that it makes beautiful prints.  The down side is everything else about this machine.  As an artist I make a lot of high quality prints of my work, and when using premium paper, and calculating that a set of ink is $120, A HQ 8x10 costs about $2.  I estimate that I spend almost $500 a year on ink and paper. The other issue is that the paper feeder is very tempermental and often has to be hand-fed one sheet at a time.  If there is even a slight flaw to the paper, it jams the rollers and eats the paper.  Another consideration is that it is huge!  about 3ft wide.  Recently the printer has been giving me so much trouble I'm ready to throw it out. I need the large format, but this printer is a big expensive headache.

The process was relatively painless and that made me even more excited.  Wifi was seamless and connected easily.  Printing was great.  Ink usage was awesome and that was the reason I changed from HP.<br /><br />Then after 31 days the printer started up with some kind of check which made it go through setup again.  After that it started printing boxes and lines over the top of the document sent to it.  The quality of the printouts also dropped markedly.<br /><br />Tried all the usual diagnostics and eventually contacted Lexmark through their customer service online chat option.  After an age of diagnostics and firmware upgrading it turns out I need a new print head which will take 3-7 days to ship.  If they had somewhere local I could pick one up from or if I could return it to the store I purchased from I wouldn't have possibly 7 days without a printer for my home business.<br /><br />Support tech advised I may have damaged the head installing the cartridges but since it worked for 108 pages I don't think this was what happened.  No paper jams so at a loss to explain the failure and it makes me concerned about ongoing reliability.<br /><br />Hence the poor customer service and lower score on quality.  If it had continued to work the way it started I would have been a happy customer.;;2.0;;February 3, 2011;;6;;6;;1.0

Easiest wireless setup, ever.;;I dumped my one year old HP 8000 wireless inkjet when it became obvious it was going to cost me two hundred dollars a year for even minimum use. You can read my review on that pig's product page for more details.<br /><br />As with most users I have no expertise in wireless.  Every time I add a device, it's plug-and-pray time. My network is run through an old Asus router which supports only WEP and WPA, not WPS. I don't know exactly what that means, other than that WPS apparently is a new standard which improves the installation process.  My home network has slowly grown to inlude a W7 desktop, a Vista laptop, two other XP desktops (I never throw away old computers), one wireless adapter for my TV and bluray player, and one wireless printer.<br /><br />I have to say that this Brother printer was the easiest installation experience I have ever had with any piece of wireless hardware.  For once, a manufacturer went to obvious effort to make certain the manual was clear and coherent.  Every step on every page is exactly representative of what was shown on the screen [Update: Mac users, see Rich Hayhurst's comment (below)]. Every paragraph is bulleted so that if you are directed to skip a step based on your particular configuration there is no confusion as to where to proceed.<br /><br />The net result is that, though I could not use what is billed as the one-button WPS setup and had to input the SSID and network key manually (I'm glad I wrote those down a couple years ago when I first set up the router), the Brother printer was recognized and up and running on all three active computers in less than twenty minutes, total.  All for little more effort than inserting the installation disk in each drive.<br /><br />The print quality is excellent, the automatic duplex functions flawlessly, the machine is fast, quiet and has a very small footprint.  I am hoping its economy and durability live up to the rest of my initial experience with this great little printer.<br /><br />p.s.: Anybody want to buy a wireless inkjet, cheap?<br /><br />Update 12/2/10 -- I do notice the paper curling (due to heat, I'm sure) some other reviewers have described.  It's possible a heavier weight paper would lessen this but I haven't had a chance to experiment, yet.  This curling might be an issue for business users who are concerned about quality of presentation in printed correspondence.  It's perfectly acceptable for my general personal uses.<br /><br />One minor tip: If you get this printer, keep in mind the paper feed in this unit is towards the front of the tray.  I'm accustomed to the top of the sheet feeding towards the rear of the tray. I was printing adhesive labels and having alignment problems until I realized this difference.;;5.0;;November 2, 2010;;101;;105;;0.961905

For a little over a week, it worked great. Printed remotely from my Ipad and from all computers in my house.  I also had documents printed at home on the Envy by emailing the document to the printer via email on my blackberry or from a computer or my Ipad outside the home.<br /><br />Less than two weeks after receiving the printer, however, there was a message on the screen stating that there is an update available and asking if I wanted to download it.  I hit the yes button, and the printer appeared to begin the download process, with the printer screen warning me not to shut off the unit until the download has been completed.  That message remained on for two and a half days, during which time the printer ceased to function. I called HP customer support.  They had me power the unit down, then turn it on again. That did not work.  They then had me take the plug out, and press the power button while putting the plug back in. That did not work either. The same message kept coming on the screen each time it got turned on, and the printer would not work.  My problem was elevated to an HP printer case manager, and I was informed that he has heard of this happening.  He offered to send a replacement, but could not guarantee I would receive a brand new, rather than refurbished, unit.  Since my printer was so new, I felt I deserved a brand new unit if I was to exchange it rather than get a full refund from Amazon, but HP would not budge on this.<br /><br />Fortunately, my 30 days from purchase was not expired, so I contacted Amazon. They were great. While I could have gotten a full refund, I chose instead to get a brand new replacement machine.  This was because, as I noted earlier, when the printer worked it was a thing of beauty. Hopefully, the new machine will not malfunction.  I plan to update this review after I see if the replacement works satisfactorily.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />The replacement printer, like the first one, worked fine for a little while, but then it also stopped working.  This time, I got the message "printing" that wouldn't come off the screen, but the machine never did print anything after that. I tried sending other documents to the printer to print. Nothing.  I then tried shutting the machine off and turning it back on again. Didn't work. Am returning it to Amazon for a full refund.;;1.0;;February 23, 2011;;43;;45;;0.955556

That being said, if you have it in your mind that this is a device for the home, then your perceptions of this will change.<br /><br />Also this a hybrid device, so as such, you really have to look at each part and see if they are worth it.<br /><br />The printer sans touchscreen.  The printer itself can be used to Scan, Copy and Print, all wirelessly, and with a built in double sided printing module.  The prints seem to look good and it prints fast.  Photo prints looked fairly good as well.  Replacement ink cartridges run around $10 for the regular capacity (bout 300 prints) to around $27 for the XL (about 750 prints).  I do like that each color has its own cartridge so you only need to replace what you run out of.  I can even use the HP iPrint app on my iPod touch and print PDFs, and photos from there.  I can also scan directly to the iPod using the App.  When Apple does the Airprint in the new iOS 4.2 it should also support printing from many more apps.  What was especially neat was that when I used Docs to Go and choose to open a PDF from there in the iPrint app, I could print it.  The printer also has the ability to use the ePrint feature without the tablet, which enables just about anything sent to a specific email address for your printer to print.  Say you were at a local hotspot reading an article that lets you email it to somebody . . you need to go and want a copy of the article for some reason . . just email it to your printer and when you get home it will be there in the paper tray waiting when you get home.  Overall, I would compare this to other $200 to $250 dollar printers out there for this functionality.  However while I'm doing all this, somebody could be using the tablet to browse the web.<br /><br />Which leads to a brief review of the tablet itself.  Now I've used an iPad and let me tell you this is no iPad.  That being said, a better comparison would be other $150 android based tablets out there that are this size.  (UPDATE: I would compare this more with a NOOK with some extra bells and whistles - I talked to a manager at the local staples about it.  He stated that he was just at a conference where the HP rep indicated it would have more android capabilities towards the first part of 2011).<br /><br />It has the standard Android buttons, headphone jack, volume up and down, power, a mini USB port, and SD card slot.  The screen is like that of an iPod or iPad in that it is based on the touch receptive glass (not sure of the fancy technical name for this).  Yahoo and Barns & Noble must have paid a bundle as it is very centric to them, which is a annoying at first, but you can actually remove or at least hide some of this by customizing your home screens and favorite apps.  Also if you start thinking of it as a 7" Nook with some extras then you'll be happier.  Fortunately there is a generic email client under the hood so that you can set it up with something other than Yahoo Mail (almost returned it right there).  I have it set up for both my wife's and my Gmail accounts and we can switch accounts easily to see our mail.  There are a handful of apps built in that are nice such as QuickOffice for viewing MS Office files (no editing tho) and PDFs.  There's also a calculator, web browser, RSS News feader (limited though),and a Facebook app that I like better than the one on my iPod Touch.  There are also a number of other apps that are not the Print Apps.  I Would like to see a Twitter App, and a YouTube App as well as some simple games like Sudoku, or even a (cough cough) a Kindle App.<br /><br />HP has it's own custom Android skin and you can only download apps that it has listed.  Most of which are the ePrint Apps as they call them.  There are lots of these for all the different holidays, kids activities, recipes, etc.  When you consider this a home device, these apps can be nice to quickly print off an activity for the kids to do if they are driving you nuts and none of the coloring books you have are good enough for them as  . . oh sorry  . . .let me get back on focus.  I've never been a big facebook user, mostly as I don't care enough to take the time to turn on my computer and I don't care for the app on the iPod.  I've actually check my facebook a couple of times this weekend and even replied to my sister for once.  Anyway. the device can be a bit sluggish when using the web browser or news headline apps, but seems fairly responsive in the email, facebook, reading ebooks, and eprint apps.  You can also print from the device when it's not docked, and control scanning as well.  By the way, YES you can scan photos directly to an inserted SD card slot.  This can be handy when grandma comes by with photos she's taken and didn't think about getting you a copy or getting you the digital file.  Just pop'em in and scan them to the SD card.  No need to turn on the computer.<br /><br />When the tablet is connect you can then do eFax as well.  No remember this is a HOME device and not an office device.  Because you can send/receive 20 faxed pages per month for free.  After that you can still do more, but there is a charge for it.  That being said, in the past 2 years I've rarely sent or received and faxes.  Only when we were taking advantage of the lower rates and decided to refinance our house.  I probably went over, but there is no phone line where we have our printers set up and with the previous print/scan/copy/fax, I would have to pull a very taut phone line to it, make sure the kids weren't anywhere around to run it to the line and knock it all over, and pray that it would work.  For me the 20 page monthly limit of efax is a non issue and is actually a plus. (UPDATE: I was also looking at Windows 7 and there is a built in fax application there.  I can plug my laptop into a phone line and scan wireless the documents as a PDF and attach them to the fax.  I little bit more fuss than using a doc feeder as you scan each page separately BUT  that's all I really need.)<br /><br />Would I buy this for an office?  Absolutely NO.<br />Would I buy this again for the home?  Probably.  Mind you, I've only had this two days.  I like what I've seen so far, but I still feel guilty about spending this much money.  It is really cool tho.  (UPDATE:  Yes I would buy it again, provided I like the idea of getting a bundle of the Printer with essentially a powered up Nook with some extra capabilities.)<br /><br />(UPDATE: After using the printer several days I was having a problem with ePrint from HP saying that the printer wasn't connected for email printing even though everything worked in my house.  After reading the forums, I ended up disabling the power saver using the IP address for the printer in my home network.  Then turning the printer itself (not the Zeen) off then back on and it has been up and running since.  Seems like this is a problem with the printer going to sleep and HP's servers not being able to wake it up to print remotely.  But I have it working now so that's a relief.  Seems this a problem that effects ALL the HP printers capable of ePrinting and is not specifically a problem with this printer.);;4.0;;November 1, 2010;;142;;151;;0.940397

No point in making a new review, just don't want someone to think i'm a marketer or canon employee if they see this elsewhere)<br /><br />This is my first and only All in one photo ink jet printer so its hard for me to compare to anything else. However, regardless whether or not I have something to compare it to, I can say that I am more than happy with my product.<br /><br />I've had it for only a few days now, but i've already put it through you know what trying to test out numerous features and settings as well as using different products (trying different photo papers, etc.). So far, I can not find even one complaint. It prints brilliant photos ( I have noticed, photo paper brand makes a very noticeable difference as well), performs excellent scans and copying / faxing functions as well as it could.<br /><br />I love the design of the mx870. When your not using it, everything closes up making a nice neat little package, unlike some other models where trays are popping out left and right. I also LOVE the "gun metal" color. It looks very sleek.<br /><br />The wireless connectivity is just awesome and setting up the wireless connection was EXTREMELY SIMPLE.  Took less than 5 minutes.<br /><br />Another important note is that so far, the ink really seems to last. I've already printed NUMEROUS photos, all at max quality (most ink used), including many 8.5 x 11" photos (which use a lot of ink due to sheer size), and the ink levels still say they are full!!!! Maybe too good to be true, hope its not a faulty ink level indicator lol (I doubt it).<br /><br />Quality seems great. They made it very functional. When you open the printer to access the print head and ink etc, a handy little kickstand pops out and keeps it open for you to free up your hands. There are handy little red lights that light up when you install ink correctly.  I guess I do have one complaint in this area though (if I HAD to nitpick); when your done placing something to scan and you go to close the bed, at first glance there seem to be some nifty "gas shocks"(?) that gently let the bed fall back down. This is a great and convenient idea, HOWEVER, not implemented entirely well because they work great right up until the last inch or so of closing at which point they "give out" and the bed slams shut. It's possible mine could just be defective. Either way, its really a small complaint because I just gently assist the closing with my hands anyway, no big deal.<br /><br />The on screen display is well suited, and easy to use. As gimmicky as it sounds, I even like the blue light up WIFI logo when you're wirelessly connected, just sort of looks cool.<br /><br />Finally, the included software is really good considering its simplicity. I have photoshop CS4 extended which will obviously blow any other photo tools out of the water. HOWEVER, i still constantly find myself using the included software instead! This is because it has really SIMPLE/QUICK but at the same time EFFECTIVE tools such as face smoothing. Just click a button, and the program automatically finds faces and helps smooth out wrinkles, or other imperfections.  It's quite a noticeable improvement, sort of how Nancy Pelosi was airbrushed for that magazine cover and she looked 20 years younger. It may sound cheesy, but once you use it and see how simple it is, I can't imagine printing photos without it.<br /><br />Now this isn't a complaint, just something I can hope for in the future. Having a wireless printer is handy, but it would be even more AMAZING if Canon could come up with a way to make the fax wireless. I don't see how this could be hard. Maybe wirelessly send the fax to the computer and have the computer dial out using the internet? Another option would be, considering most people have digital phone service nowadays through their modem, the printer could again wirelessly send the fax to the router which is already connected to the modem containing the phone line for digital phone service. With today's technology, having the fax be wireless as well should be AN EASY problem to solve. This would make their printer TRULY WIRELESS and would be a class leader (though, I must say I would buy a whole new printer just to have such a feature, which is bad for my bank account).<br /><br />Sorry for the wall of text, just trying to be as descriptive as possible and cover all angles for any people considering this printer.<br /><br />One final note. Before I settled on this printer, I must have researched and compared other all in ones for 3 days or more. In the end all that research pointed to this printer, and now that I have received it and tested it, I can confirm it. Other potential printers included "somethingpro 8500" (not allowed to say actual name, but you get the idea). That thing is more than 2.5 times more expensive and lacks many of the mx870's features. Point is, not only is this printer great, its VERY WELL PRICED. I would have paid twice as much as or more after testing this thing out.  Can't believe I picked this thing up for only (not allowed to say here, but i assure you its a really great price when compared to similar products) with free shipping (shop around and you'll find it, substantially lower than MSRP).<br /><br />If you need an all in one, BUY THIS CANON. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. YOU WILL WONDER HOW YOU EVER GOT BY WITHOUT THIS THING, AND WITH ALL THE MONEY YOU SAVE OVER ITS COMPETITION YOU CAN BUY ENOUGH INK TO LAST YOU THE REST OF THE YEAR!!!!<br /><br />(as overly positive as this review seems, I PROMISE YOU I am NOT working for canon. I normally don't even review items, but when I'm this pleased I want to spread the word. ENJOY!)<br /><br />PROTIP: From my experience so far, get the printworks gloss photo paper over HP's 5 star version.  Its cheaper, and identical images come out noticeably better on printworks.  Can't speak for other finishes i.e. matte or semi-gloss, but the gloss is much better.  I also have not tried canons line of products, but intend to next.;;5.0;;May 14, 2010;;392;;400;;0.98

I have been using Vista since the beta version, and I actually like it. I have also been testing Windows 7, which is similar to Vista, but is supposed to need less computer resources and be MORE compatible.<br />I love this printer on Vista with a USB connection. The network connection was a bit slow but the USB was great. The colors are incredible for a laser printer. I am a Realtor and do a LOT of printing. With this printer I can print my own fliers, which saves on printing costs. I've owned the printer less than a year.<br /><br />HP has no intention of supporting this printer on Windows 7 64bit. So, now that I've spent hours upgradding my main computer,not to mention hundreds of dollars for Windows 7, I've learned that my best printer is NOT compatible.<br /><br />So - if you are considering this printer, and there is any chance that you will be converting to Windows 7 - forget it, look elsewhere.<br /><br />By the way AMAZON is awesome - this is NO reflection on them.<br />I am very angry with HP who has decided NOT to write Windows 7 drivers.<br /><br />If you are sticking with Vista or XP then this is a great printer.;;1.0;;October 8, 2009;;7;;9;;0.777778

What I have printer so far look great. The printer is much slower than the HP Photosmart I'm replacing.  Because of the size of the printer I could not put it on the computer desk and had to put on a table on the other side of the room. I needed to add a USB hub between the computer and printer to make the distance. Sure wish the printer had wireless and/or Ethernet like the HP printers.<br /><br />If your buying expecting to get a rebate; good luck. Do a Google search and you will find many complaints. The company handling the rebate sent me a letter with very little detail stating "... rebate can not be honored. UPC label is missing.  UPC is invalid." I sent the Printer and EOS 7D UPCs per the pictures in the instructions.  The printer has multiple UPCs. I sent the one that matched the picture on the rebate form.

The initial setup was easy and the printer looks great but it went down hill after that.  It makes many noises when powering up, just FYI!  The ePrint function would not work and finally I had to get tech support involved to try and resolve the issue.  After about 45 minutes of checking this and that, it was finally determined by the tech (which was in India, come on HP give some Americans jobs!) that the problem was with HP's ePrint server.  I was told to try again in 24 hours and see if the server was back up.  I finally got that working after 8 days but I had another issue, and this is the one that was the worst.  If I had to live without ePrint, so be it.  But I can't live with lines in my printouts. I had horizontal lines in every page I tried to print or if I made copies.  I did the clean printheads, align printheads, calibrate linefeed, over and over again. I would print the Quality Report and it would still show lines.  I removed the ink cartridges and printheads, power off with button held in and power cord unplugged from printer, checked HP's website for diagnosing the problem and they recommended replacing the printheads after doing all that I had done.  Okay, this is a NEW printer and I have to replace the printheads already?  Are you kidding me?  I am not going to spend another $100 plus to replace the printheads.  So, today I finally call HP support because enough was enough and again I get a guy in India.  Nice guy and I explained everything that I had done already to this point and he had me try a few other things but it didn't work.  It was determined that the printer has a hardware issue.  So, HP is going to send me a REFURBISHED printer at no cost to me provided I get the current one sent back within three days and HP must receive it within 15 days or I get charged for a NEW one???  I guess I could of sent this back to Amazon but then I would have been charged shipping charges and it is an opened product and most of the ink is already used.  I don't know what the charges would of been but so be it and I need a printer.  If the refurbished one doesn't work, then they will have to send me another one until I get one that works without problems...so, maybe I will end up with a new one after all.<br /><br />Anyway, the printer is fast, makes fast copies, and the scanner is fast.  I don't use the fax, so I don't know how well that works.  I like the touch screen but I do wish that HP had put an arm for support on the scanner/copy lid because it doesn't have one.  You have to be careful with that!  Making copies with front and back is pretty quick, quicker than I thought it would be.  It's not a bad printer but HP needs to get the bugs worked out.  For those of you who have had no problems with your printer, be thankful.  For me, this is a learning experience and this is also my first HP printer.  I have always hated their printers and thought they were junk because of places where I worked they had HP printers and they were always breaking down.  I have either had Canon or Epson printers but neither company had a printer that had these capabilities.  The ePrint is a very nice feature.  It's nice to be at work and be able to print something to this printer while I am still at work.<br /><br />Would I recommend this printer?  Yes, but with hesitation.  If Canon, or even Epson, had a printer that had these capabilities, I would have most certainly bought on of those, especially the Canon.  I have had three Canon printers and one Epson and I only had to have one Canon repaired and it was still under warranty.  I guess the more functions the printer has the more that can go wrong.<br /><br />I will try to update this when I get the refurbished printer because I would like to let you know the continuing story.  So, until next time....<br /><br />Update...<br /><br />I got my NEW printer, not REFURBISED, on 1/6/2011 and it works as it is suppose to work. This printer is much quieter, no lines in the printouts. The ink consumption is low and printouts look good. Now I can give it 4 stars but the reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the scanner/copier lid does not have a support arm. If you are doing lots of photos, then this is not the printer you want. I do recommend it for printing webpages, documents, spreadsheets and any other general type printing. The best thing about it is it's wireless and the ePrint on this printer worked the first time. Setup is easy and now I have a printer that works!<br /><br />I sent the bad printer back on 1/8/2011 and HP received it today.

I have 25 years experience supporting various hardware and software, so minor technical issues that put other users off are usually easy for me to resolve.<br /><br />I selected this printer specifically to replace my 8 year old every-day medium duty Monochrome laser, a Samsung 2151n that had begun to error out on the occasional print job. I also had a large color mailing for my business coming up and thought I might save some money and time instead of dealing with a four year old inkjet that usually gets that job. The target was better than 20 PPM, network and duplexing with very good color graphic output, good durability, medium duty, and less than $600.00 for the printer and a full set of high yield toner cartridges. There aren't a lot of printers that meet all of those criteria. HP's are too slow and expensive, and everything else in the price range has crappy color output.<br /><br />Windows support, speed, networking, quality, and duplexing were all flawless. The one issue I have is the output tray is not well designed. In order to run a substantial sized duplex job, you will have to close the output tray guide and put a box behind the printer to catch sheets as they are pushed over the edge or just stand next to the darn thing and pick them up hot out of the output feeder. Otherwise, we got output jams after fifteen pages or less once it got warm (paper sticks together easier). Better paper might put that number higher, but right around 25 sheets using the built in output tray guide and the collected output paper obstructs the output feeder entirely.<br /><br />One note on OS support. We use Ubuntu Linux extensively here and I went through the process of obtaining the manufacturer provided PPD files and installing them. This turned out to be a bad idea as the Lexmark provided PPD under CUPS slowed color printing to a crawl compared to native Ubuntu Foomatic PPD which runs at near Windows speed.<br /><br />Overall, this printer is an excellent combination of features and capabilities for the price. The output tray sucks if you have any major work to do on it.<br /><br />[...];;5.0;;December 17, 2010;;4;;5;;0.8

The print head comes un-installed. I had a little apprehension putting in the print head. The gray bar that is raised has a stiff spring. It would not be the first time I have pulled something too hard, but there are no locks or catches. It just lifts up. The head went in smooth as did ink installation. The next step is to put power on and wait for the printer to align. This takes some time. The printer werrs, pops, grinds, sounds like it is trying to load paper, but eventually prints, JUST WAIT.<br /><br />After plugging in the Ethernet cable, the network light came on, and pressing the light got me a network printout. (However, it was not necessary). From here you put the disk in the computer and follow instructions. I installed the printer on three computers, a desktop wired to network, and Asus EEEpc, wireless (copy all files to a usb and run setup from the usb), and a laptop also wireless. The desktop with Vista required me to except port 427, the Asus running XP required nothing, and the Laptop running Vista and Zone Alarm required reconfiguring Zone Alarm. The good thing is the firewall changes required were somewhat explained by the software. The Zone Alarm instructions were better than the Windows FireAlarm instructions.<br /><br />I have read many of the 'professional' reviews on this printer. Now that I have it installed and have printed several test prints, some thoughts. Print speed, is well within acceptable limits. In fact I read one review that said it was too slow. I disagree with that. I also read that the 'Photo' quality was not good. Well it is certainly good enough. It does make noise, however, it is no worse that most other HP ink jets I have dealt with. It is not a factor for me, but it it were I would pick the Wireless model and stick the thing in a closet somewhere.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this printer to anyone looking for no frills printing. I particularly like the cost of ink! While I have refilled carts before, at $9.99 for color carts, for 300 pages and $14.99 for 700 pages, I don't think I will mess with it. The black XL cart is suppose to print 1,200 pages that is almost 5 reams of paper!;;5.0;;October 21, 2009;;83;;85;;0.976471

It's very fast and very crisp.  It's everything I expected from a new b&w laser printer, at a fraction of the expected price.  It also does a VERY nice job of making copies.<br /><br />Scanning is a problem though.  The software comes up on my computer but the whole thing hangs at 0% complete.  I left it running overnight (thinking it just took a while) without any progress.  I'm running Windows 7 Pro 64-bit.  I don't scan often so it's not a deal-breaker for me.

This is thick paper!!<br />The 7510 jammed each and every time. Even tried feeding single sheets....jammed over and over again...always!<br />I was going to try my Canon i80...which feeds from the top, and does not have to flip the paper over, but it has<br />not been used in a while and probably has dried out ink.<br />So, I tried the old Deskjet 970cse.<br />FLAWLESS!!!  Printed the entire job without missing a beat!<br />I may also mention this...<br />Once upon a time, it was expensive to purchase a inkjet printer that could compare with the quality from a lab for printing photographs. Then the printers got good enough, and cheap enough to make it a good deal. That is my 970, two Epson Stylus printers, and the Canon.<br />What has happened recently...is that online photo processing has gotten cheaper, and faster...with slick web interfaces that provide free photo storage, and the printer companies (mostly HP) have gotten too greedy with cost of ink, that it no longer pays to print pictures yourself.<br />NOTE THAT TO FILL THIS PRINTER UP WITH NEW CARTRIDGES WILL COST OVER A HUNDRED BUCKS!!!<br />This is from Staples, and the larger reservoir cartridges. Yes, you can get aftermarket or Cartridge World knock-offs...but then HP has it so the ink level indicator will not work unless you use their cartridges alone.

When HP sent a replacement, the Tech Support person neglected to say that HP's policy is to always send a "refurbished" unit as a replacement. Seeing it was obviously a refurbished unit, and as my purchase was brand new-out of the box, I "strongly" objected to this "policy" -- and was then sent the newer, replacement model OfficeJet Pro 8500A Plus.<br /><br />[BTW: When I attempted to install the "refurbished" unit just to have a working printer/fax -- it was also a dud.....]<br /><br />I installed the newer model 8500A using HP's telephone Tech Support -- and it worked for a day. Today I spend THREE hours with a Senior Tech Support woman who was wonderfully patient -- and succeeded in making the 8500A work with my Mac OS 10.6.5. Unfortunately, that three hour period on the phone with her meant I was unable to prepare necessary documents for an intercontinental business trip later in the day, and had to change my flight to another day -- amongst other arrangements.<br /><br />I am a Home Office user, but when HP's Robo-Phone system hears "OfficeJet 8500" -- you are automatically routed away from Home Office Tech Support to Business Support. Unfortunately, Business Support does not "support" Mac OS. This happened each time I redialed into the Home Office Tech Support.<br /><br />Many, many attempts later, I was able to get into the Mac area within Home Office Tech Support -- but after too many conversations they eventually realized that this was a "hardware" issue, not a "software" issue, so I was shunted back to Business Support -- who then finally sent me the "refurbished" unit.<br /><br />TOTAL TIME FRAME: 2+ weeks. TOTAL PHONE TIME: 10+ hours [The latter is accurate! I timed it.....]<br /><br />I am a very knowledgeable with computers & related gear such as printers [having owned other HP, as well as Xerox, Canon, Epson and other brands of printers].<br /><br />However, I have never experienced such utter frustration or massive waste of my [billable] time on any single computer, printer -- or other Consumer Electronics product -- and I have been an executive in the Consumer Electronics industry over four decades. That includes working in China, and with many Chinese factories manufacturing product for Brands such as HP.<br /><br />My encounter with the HP 8500 series surely has to be an exception -- I hope for others' sake.

There are no words, just pictograms that aren't always as clear as one might prefer.  Eventually I got it unpacked and installed, and got the drivers installed.<br /><br />Once installed, the print quality is great, and it prints pretty fast.

The printer won't even scan something, which actually requires absolutely no ink and simply sends an image file to my computer, without a new cartridge.  In fact, if you run out of the yellow cartridge, you can't even print out a word document written in black.  I can't even find the right ink cartridge in local computer stores, and Walgreens doesn't have the correct inks to refill it, which means it's super obscure and you can only buy it from Epson directly.

I'd originally abandoned my loyalty to HP printers, and switched to Brother, due to the bloated and intrusive software I had to use with my old OfficeJet 6110.  Unfortunately, the Brother had unreliable communications.  So it's back to HP.<br /><br />DEMOGRAPHICS<br />My wife and I both work from home so we really do need a fast, reliable, affordable, all-in-one type of printer that can work with multiple platforms such as Windows 7, Windows XP, OS X, and iOS.  We don't do a lot of photo or color printing so while it's something that's nice to have, it doesn't have to be top notch.  If we really need to print a photo we just take the file to Target or Walgreens, and if we need to create pretty, color brochures, we go to Kinko's.  This is a productivity oriented printer so if you need perfect color prints, you won't be happy with the results here.<br /><br />SETUP & INSTALL<br />The touchscreen interface is really quite nice; I'm not sure why everyone complains about it.  It's not a capacitive touchscreen like your smartphone (I'm guessing it's a resistive touchscreen) so it requires a little more force to activate than your smartphone.  This is hardly a big deal.  I'm not typing an essay on the thing, I just need it to respond to a few inputs now and then.  Because it's a touchscreen, it's able to dynamically change during setup to make setup intuitive.  No more guessing which button you need to press to do something.  It also has neat little videos that play on the screen during setup to show you how to do something, like install the ink cartridges, or any accessories.<br />Following the recommendations of online reviews I read, I downloaded the software online rather than use the provided CD.  The software installed without a hitch on the Windows machines, found the printer, and was ready to go.  The software the Mac almost went in without a hitch, but for some reason the "scan to computer" function wasn't available.  I re-ran the setup wizard and it magically appeared.<br />So once that's all done, you are ready to go.  There's a lot of tweaking that you can still do though so if things aren't perfect, don't be disappointed.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br />The print quality is acceptable.  If you want to print photos for framing, don't buy this printer.  If you want to print fancy brochures, don't buy this printer.  This is an office printer.  It's actually in the name, "OfficeJet".  If you want a photo printer, HP has a solution for that and they call it "PhotoSmart".  Marketing people are so clever aren't they?  Anyway, the print quality is good enough for an office environment where you plan on printing document to share with colleagues, clients, or collaborators.  Also, this printer is fast, or at least faster than any other printer we've had in the office.  The only downside to fast is that you have to keep the output tray extended or your documents will be strewn all over the floor.<br /><br />FEATURES<br />The whole HP ePrint thing is new to me so you'll have to forgive me for getting excited about something that might be old hat.  My work PC (Windows XP) uses a VPN to connect to HQ and some underlying IT settings mean that once I hook up to the VPN, I can no longer print to my network connected printer, including this one.  With HP ePrint, however, I now have a clever workaround now!  For one thing, if I'm using Google Chrome as a browser and want to print something from there, I can use Google Cloud Print to send the document to my printer.  Setup of the HP ePrint feature is easy and free.  Unfortunately if I want to print something like a Word Document, I have to e-mail that document to my printer's e-mail address.  This isn't especially difficult, but it means I now have a bunch of large documents cluttering up my SENT folder.  The printer can handle most common documents types such as Word, PDF, text, etc...  The advantage here is that I can print to the device from any device with e-mail anywhere in the world.  Just send the file as an attachment to YOUR_ADDRESS@hpeprint.com and you're done.<br />We don't send or receive many faxes so we don't have a dedicated fax line, but when we do need to send or receive a document, it's really nice if it just works.  Having to unplug and swap phone cables isn't a lot of fun and we don't have a lot of time to stand next to the printer waiting to see if an incoming call is a fax so we can press the RECEIVE button.  Many of the printers we've used before claim to have the ability to intercept incoming fax calls, but we've never had one work right.  This is the first exception.  Simply tell the printer what your phone/fax configuration and it adjusts its behavior to work.  In our case we have an answering machine.  The printer listens in on the call after the answering machine answers.  If it hears the beep beep beep of an incoming fax, it intercepts the call and receives the fax.  We have it setup to just store incoming faxes as a PDF document on our server rather than print them, but you can also have it send the faxes to you as an e-mail.<br />Scanning is where we had the most pain with our old Brother.  The software would work maybe 75% of the time and no amount of troubleshooting could ever change that; it just depended on luck.  With the HP, those days seem to be over.  Scans, whether initiated from the printer or our workstations, go through without a hitch.  The nice part about scanning on this thing is that you have many options about how to handle your scan.  When operating the scan from the printer you can send it to your computer, a mapped network drive, an e-mail recipient, or an SD card.  You can also specify whether to save the file as a PDF, JPG, or TIFF.  You can have an address book stored on the printer for the purposes of e-mail documents, but alas you have to manually enter it; I've not found a way to import an address book.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />I'm happy with the printer.  The price, features, and quality of print are exactly what we were looking for.  The quality of construction and the quality of the software are what I would expect from something in this price range.  The printer is a bit large, but again, it's an office printer.  Don't buy this for someone living in a dorm room; they will hate you.  This printer has restored my faith in HP printers and I'm seriously considering buying a PhotoSmart printer so we can avoid those very occasional trips to Target or Kinko's.;;4.0;;March 21, 2012;;5;;5;;1.0

So far so GREAT!  Opened the box to find a yellow sheet titled: "Attention AirPrint Users".  It then explains that to enable AirPrint capability install the latest firmware available from Epson's website.  My first though was "WOW", I thought only HP printers had this capability.  So OK, I'll bite.  I installed the printer on MAC OSX Lion without any problems at all.  Flawless.  So then the firmware upgrade.  This part always makes me a little nervous but the Epson step-by-step instructions were very clear.  Firmware upgrade take about 10-15 minutes and remember DON'T turn it off or unplug it during this process.  Once the firmware was upgraded I went to an email on my iPhone, clicked the AirPrint button, then Print, and EPSON Airtisan 730 shows up, along with a selector for the number of copies, and single/double sided (on/off).  I hit Print and sure enough out comes my complete email.  I then check Safari and iBooks and yes, it will print from those natively as well.  No EPSON or third party app required.  So, you ask what's the big deal?  Well the deal is that nowhere on the Epson website or on the box does it mention printing compatibility with AirPrint.  I even went to Apple's official list of AirPrint printers and it's not yet listed there either, just HP.<br /><br />Artisan 725 VS 730<br />I had been looking at the Artisan 725 and couldn't find much product information on the differences on this newer model.  Here's what I've come up with so far:<br />1. Very slightly high print speeds, but not enough for anyone to notice.<br />2. Difference in droplet size.  Fixed size on the 725, 5 sizes on the 730.<br />3. Front panel.  725 has a bit of a clunky button arrangement to hold/release the front panel up at an angle.  The 730 does away with that and replaces it with a nice, smooth friction-type design.<br />4. Appearance.  725 is all black.  730 has some dark blue accents around the top.<br /><br />Printing<br />I've printed a few pages  and a few photos.  So far, faster than my old HP C6380 and better quality.<br /><br />Scanning<br />Nice, high resolution at much higher speeds than my old HP as well.<br /><br />I'll update this review as I get more time on this printer.

This is the first dedicated photo printer I've purchased... until I saw some sample prints at a local Staples, I wasn't convinced that I wanted to be bothered printing my work, after all it looks pretty great on a decent sized monitor. But believe me, once you see a 13x19 borderless print that is printed exactly the way you want and literally pops off the page, you'll be sold too.<br /><br />As far as the build goes, this thing is honkin' HUGE and extremely heavy. The footprint is somewhat large even in comparison to other 13x19 printers I've seen, but it has a clean look and folds up to a perfect rectangular block when not in use (which makes it easier to transport and store; probably even moreso than other models that are physically smaller.) When you are printing from the front tray (on thicker papers), you need a significant clearance in front of and behind the printer; it has wheels so it can easily be pulled away from a wall when in use.<br /><br />The print quality is, well, perfect. As many have noted, there is no difference between the 13x19s this device prints and something from a lab. The software it comes with is surprisingly helpful too - not some amateur photo printing package, but a CS/CS2/CS3 plugin that is designed specifically for this printer that does all of the color management work for you... a further reflection that this really is a professional grade printer. It prints on a wide range of papers, and the front loading feature makes it a little less scary to feed some 3rd party media into the printer. What's truly amazing is the SPEED at which this thing can bang out prints... it's VERY, VERY fast (13x19 at the very best quality setting has yet to exceed 1.5min for me.)<br /><br />Sure, the ink is expensive, as is the large format paper this thing takes... it isn't cheap to run. But it's well worth it when you see your work in all of its glory.<br /><br />Qualms? I have very few. This printer does make a lot of mechanical noises that sometimes sound unhealthy, as though someone is trying to beat their way out from the inside... but this is something that anyone who has an inkjet printer has come to expect.;;5.0;;October 1, 2007;;12;;12;;1.0

R9SH8NCF73NHA;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ;;Printer;;B004813AXG;;8570DN - Color Printer - Color - Ink-jet - Color: Up To 40 Pages/min, Black: Up;;Great Printer;;We purchased this for one of our customers as a replacement to an older Brother color inkjet printer. This is the newer version of the Xerox Phaser 8500 series printers. The 8570DN "ColorCube" is based on the same basic design as the infamous Phaser printers that are very good for small to large sized businesses, but not so good for occasional home use. Like the Phaser, the 8570 uses Xerox's 4-color (cyan, yellow, black, and magenta) solid ink technology. Unlike a powered toner or liquid ink cartridge in a laser or inkjet printer, the "ink" comes in specially designed solid blocks and has the consistency of wax. The printer melts the wax and stores it in a liquid state until it's ready to be used and then applies it to the stock like an inkjet printer would. This is a great design in concept and works very well, but there are a few caveats.<br /><br />The 8570 is pretty big, easily bigger than an HP Laser Jet 2100, take up a good chink of desk space, and weighs a lot. I estimated it weighs about 65 lbs and it took my boss and I to carry it over to where it was being set up! Once it was unboxed, you cold tell that Xerox put a lot of thought into their packaging. There's a minimum of polystyrene and plastic in the box, and all of the compartments and access doors are taped off to keep them from opening. The tape also has tabbed edges so it was easier to peel it off. Thanks Xerox! Features include a good-sized paper tray (I estimated it would hold 500 sheets) that has adjustable guides for lots of different paper sizes. It comes with the very important maintenance kit, overflow/waste tray, and 2 sets of ink (one set was already in the printer). There's a fold-out front feeder and access port for clearing jams as well. It's pretty straightforward to set it up. You get a set-up guide, which wasn't much help if you don't know what you're doing, and a user guide that's in about 10 different languages. The driver software comes on a CD-ROM and is includes a video tutorial of the exact same user and installation guides you get in the box, which doesn't make sense to me. Why not just put it on the CD?<br /><br />Initial set up is easy. Loading paper is a snap...pull out the tray and set it in. You shouldn't have to adjust the guides at all if you're using A5 letter paper. Loading the ink blocks is also simple. Just lift open the top and drop them into their respective slots (the blocks are shaped so they will only go in one way so you don't put one in the wrong slot). You have to remove the access panel on the rear right hand side to access the power socket, ethernet, and USB port. The 8570 supports both USB and ethernet networking connectivity, and neither cords are included (lame...you'd think Xerox would include a $3 cord with a printer that costs $500). You do get a standard 3-prong power cord like the ones PC's use and it's pretty long, which was great. There is no WiFi connectivity, but that's actually not a bad thing. WiFi can be unreliable, and when it goes down, you can't print which can be bad. For a home user, it's fine, but for business, productivity mandates reliability.<br /><br />The printer has to be connected (counterintuitive to what I have learned in IT) and powered on before installing the drivers, but the configuration procedure (we set it up on a network and gave it a static IP, which was easy) was very easy. The driver install wizard was also super simple. It pretty much did all the work for you and was very fast. The wizard finished in about 2 minutes. It runs Adobe PostScript and PCL5, so that was a nice addition. The menus were well laid-out. Some of them were a little confusing, but everything was pretty easy to find. The initial power-on procedure took forever and a day. From activation to first print took (no joke) about 20 minutes, but after that, pages printed very quickly, about 5 seconds from "print" to print, and the print speed averaged about 30 pages per minute color and b/w. About average for these types of machines. When the machine isn't being used for a while, it goes into standby "power save" mode. The 8570DN model will also do automatic duplexing and can print on just about any type of paper or media you ask it to (aside from huge banners), brochures, pamphlets, cards, letters, photos, envelopes etc.<br /><br />Print quality is very good and Xerox lists the max resolution as 2400dpi for color and black. I was impressed with the color reproduction capabilities of the 8570. The colors were very rich and vibrant, I'd say as good if not a little better than a color laser, and the blacks were very crisp just like a good laser, so nothing to complain about there. The texture of the print is also very nice. Thanks to the solid ink, the prints are shiny and a little raised, giving it the look of a business card, and this will make it so you can get very good print quality even if you are using cheap paper, which is good for cost-savings. However, the quality when printing photos wasn't that great. I have seen better photos come out of a $150 inkjet printer, but the Xerox can print on glossy or matte photo paper (unlike a laser, which uses heat and would ruin the plastics in the paper) to help the quality, but to be fair this isn't a photo printer and wasn't designed to be. Text and graphics came out excellent! I was impressed. One downside is that you can't laminate ColorCube prints because the heat of the laminator remelts the ink and can cause smudged or blurred texts or graphics, sort of like an out-of-focus camera image.<br /><br />Paper jams with this machine are pretty rare, and they are painfully reliable. I rarely hear of these breaking down, even under heavy use. If you can, get the extended warranty from Xerox. If it breaks, they send a tech out to fix it for no charge (like Dell's service). Duty cycles are high, with (as per Xerox's recommendation) of 85000 images per month. The ink also lasts a long time (provided you don't turn it off). High volume applications can have the large blocks last for several months before needing to be replaced, and the printer holds a lot of ink. It came with 2 sets of the small blocks, and you could fit up to 4 of those blocks in the slots. Xerox also sells the larger blocks for longer life as well.<br /><br />Now, for those who have read some less than amicable reviews of this, I will say that for what it was designed to do (print) it does fantastically, but for most of us, the 8570 will be overkill and possibly a little annoying or hard to live with. It is noisy and impractical for anything less than continuous or commercial use (like in an office environment). Turning it on takes forever, and during the warm up process it makes lots of weird noises...clunks, squeaks, hissing, grunts, you name it. My boss said it sounded like a Star Trek Tricorder a couple times! During the print process you get a mechanical racket of clanking and thumping until your print comes out. It's not obnoxious, but noticeable. It does have a "quiet mode" that did help with the noise, but not a drastic improvement.<br /><br />The printer does have fans that run to keep parts inside cool, but they aren't noisy at all, about like a PC fan, but quieter. The room also started to smell a little bit like chemicals, no doubt from the melted ink in the printer, but it went away. Also, when I turned it on, I got a warning saying the maintenance kit wasn't installed even though it was, so I took it out and put it back In and it was fine. Another annoying thing is that after the initial configuration it printed 8 pages of the printer configuration specifications...what a waste, and after every reset it would print a status page. Annoying. You can turn this feature off though to prevent it from recurring.<br /><br />The other issue is that the ink is expensive. To replace an entire set will run $100 or more, so you could essentially buy a new inkjet printer with the ink replacement costs of the ColorCube, but again, this is a work machine that costs $500, so in the long run it is still cost-effective because the blocks last a long time. You measure their duty cycle in thousands of pages instead of hundreds like with high capacity inkjet cartridges, which cost about $80 to replace a set of 6 cartridges (like with an HP C6000-7000 series printer) and $50 to replace 4. Others have complained that it wastes ink, and it does, but only if you turn it off. Xerox even recommends that you don't turn it off unless you absolutely have to. The reason is that the printer keeps some ink in a liquid state so it can use it to print a job instead of waiting to melt some (which takes 15 minutes). When the power to the heater is turned off, it is forced to dump out the melted ink to prevent it from solidifying and clogging (ruining) the print heads. This is why it has a power save mode. Some complain that it doesn't save power, but it's really not that bad. The full-load of this machine is over 200 watts, but the at-rest power consumption is about 45 watts. During the power save mode it isn't that noisy at all. I only heard a really quiet fan running on occasion and that's it. More than quiet enough for an office, but it's something else when it's printing, which is why this wouldn't be optimum for a home.<br /><br />On a side note, for those who want to cost costs by buying third-party ink...don't.<br /><br />Xerox inks have a proprietary formulation that makes them melt completely and evenly, and the ink particle size is optimized for the printer. Third-party inks are not made the same way with the same formulation, and although you can use them and make them work, it's not worth the risk of having the ink solidify in the print head or clog it up. Aftermarket inks also have trouble duplicating the colors and saturations the OEM inks do, which is problematic if you want nice prints. So, if you don't mind running the risk damaging the printer or wasting money on inferior prints, then go for third party inks. Some companies offer a free replacement guarantee where they replace your printer or components if it's damaged by the ink, but it's not worth the risk (or downtime!)....just my professional opinion.<br /><br />So...<br /><br />Pro's:<br /><br />Reliable<br />Very good print quality for graphics and text<br />Lots of essential and useful productivity features<br />Ink lasts a long time<br />High duty cycle<br />Fast first print<br />Easy to set up<br />Versatile, can use a variety of stock quality, type and size<br /><br />Con's:<br /><br />Printer is a little expensive<br />Ink is expensive<br />Big and heavy<br />It can be annoyingly noisy<br />Can't turn it off<br />Can't laminate prints due to remelting of the ink<br />Photo prints not on par with inkjet printers<br /><br />I really like the Phaser printers and my customers have nothing but good things to say about them. For an office or high volume production environment these are excellent printers! You can't go wrong with a laser, but the Phaser/ColorCube fills a very specialized niche and can do everything a laser can with added duty cycles and lower costs.;;4.0;;June 13, 2012;;8;;8;;1.0

Upgraded from a Epson R2400.  Reason for upgrading, couldn't keep the epson's printhead from clogging.  Wasted more ink trying to keep the printheads clean then I actually used printing pictures.  As far as print quality goes between the two is basically a toss up.  Prints from the canon are more glossy then the epson probably due to the fact the canon uses dye inks while the epson uses pigment.  The only thing I don't like about the canon is right out of the box the prints seem to have to much red in them.  Playing around in Adobe CS4 I was able to get the prints to my liking.  With the easyprint software included with the printer, no matter what setting it seemed all the pictures have a red tint to them.  This is one area the epson had an advantage, the easyprint software that came with the epson produced prints spot on.  This is the reason I gave the printer a four star instead of five.  The people that use adobe photoshop to print all their pictures won't have a problem, but people like me that like using the easyphoto program to print out a bunch of picutres might be somewhat disappointed.  A couple of more pluses of the printer are:  Turns out prints faster then the epson R2400.  Prints look sharp on a wide variety of paper, not just the canon paper.  This was one drawback of the epson R2400, seemed only to print good on epson paper.  Not the case with the canon.  Also, seems better on ink compared to the epson so far.  I have printed a lot of photos of all sizes and all the ink levels are still pretty close to full.  Overall I would definetly recommend this printer.;;4.0;;May 4, 2009;;185;;189;;0.978836

It just goes into sleep mode and remains very quiet while still being accessible wirelessly.<br />- You can control scanning, with or without the ADF, either from PC or from the scanner directly (your choice)<br />- Nice built quality. It's not like the $1500 multifunction at my former employer but WAY better than the $200 HPs and Canons.<br />- Bundled Nuance software is really good!

Certainly adds more value to this product, I'm tempted to rate this a 5/5 now ...<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Scanning is only one sided, the duplex unit is only for printing<br />- It is NOT AirPrint compatible, so the advertised "iOS/iPhone/iPad printing" is ONLY if you use Brother's custom app which ONLY allows printing from your photo album. You CANNOT print from any of the usual Apps (Mail, Safari, etc). It's like having a PC printer but being able to print ONLY from one specific Application and only one specific filetype.

I purchased this to print brochures & other color graphic advertising material.  I have not overtaxed the printer as I may only print 50-100 items every so often.  First off the printer seemed OK although it had a few ghost images or smudges that it would sometimes print on the next sheet.  then after about the first 100 print jobs all the toner ran out.  Now I know laser printers are shipped with starter toner which is incredibly cheap of them but I accept that as common practice, but this is really low & if you buy this unit you may as well order toner at the same time.  The first real problem was when I went to change the toner, be very careful with this operation.  It has a rotating carousel that the toner cartridges fit into & you change one close the door & hit the rotate toner button to queue up the next cartridge for changing.  The rotation stopped & the next color lit up so I opened the door & the printer started rotating again then I was unable to close the door & the whole thing was jammed.  During this process I broke off a little spring clip rendering the printer completely inoperable.  I then decided since I have all this toner which cost more than the printer to go buy another & try again.  2nd printer also ran out of starter toner extremely quick (about 100 pages, with smudges or other flaws on about 5% of all pages) I very carefully replaced all the toner cartridges & began printing again at first it seemed OK except for the occasional smudge or ghost image from a previous page.  then it started jamming & refusing to feed paper, every few copies I would have to remove the paper, fan it out & pray for success.  Next the printer spit out plastic that looked like saran wrap & then flaws began showing up on every page.  Ii opened it up & saw the roller that gets hot had melted & the surface of it had peeled off, so I went into the closet & removed this part from my already broken printer & swapped them out.  Later the same thing happened to the second roller unit, & now 100% of sheets have print flaws in them & the printer crinkles pages about 25% of the time causing me to have to dissasemble & remove constantly.  I am now shopping for a different brand of printer even though I have 99% of all toner cartridges remaining.  All this trouble has occured with less than 800 pages printed on the second printer & about 150 pages printed on the first, I would say I have thrown out about 200 of those pages due to really bad print quality & felt a bit embarassed about the quality of half of the rest of the pages.  The great deal cheap printer ended up costing me about $500-$600 dollars considering I had to buy 2 & a set of cartridges.  Thats about $0.70/sheet + paper & agravation.<br /><br />Save yourself the trouble & find a different printer.;;1.0;;December 29, 2010;;24;;29;;0.827586

The scans look great and the prints, while not the best, are very usable.  Pencil a page, scan it in, edit/blow it up/whatever, print out the pencils in non-photo blue on you bristol board, and ink away.  The great thing about this is that you have a saved copy of you pencils ready to be reprinted if you mess up the inks.

The manual single page feeder is great, because it doesn't loop the paper like the automatic paper feeder does.  This is ideal for you thicker, more expensive bristol board.

Photos are a different story, however.<br /><br />A color laser is never going to give you the sort of lab-quality prints you expect from a high quality injket photo printer matched with the right paper.  However, it can come close enough when simply "very nice looking" is all you need, and you want the results faster and cheaper.  For example, a real estate brochure or something similar.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not all color laser printers are up to "good enough" when it comes to photos.  I owned a Xerox 6110n, for example, which did a terrible job with the subtle color ranges in flesh tones.  As a result, faces looked flat and cartoonish, completely unacceptable.  I'm pleased to say the HP CP2025dn is much, much better.  I doubt you'll get better color reproduction with any other color laser printer.<br /><br />It has two paper trays, which means you can stick envelopes in the multi-purpose tray and ordinary paper in the built-in tray, and you won't need to change back and forth as I did with printers with just a single tray.  There have been some rumors to the effect that early copies of this printer had problems feeding from tray #2 when there was anything in the multi-purpose tray, but I had no such difficulty.<br /><br />Setup was rather easier than my previous network printer.  I didn't have to set up a fixed IP address and re-direct a fake USB port to that address; the installation program found the printer without difficulty.<br /><br />It's fairly compact, unlike many color lasers.  Amazon gives the box dimensions, but the printer itself is actually 15.5" wide x 18" deep x 12.5" tall.  You'll need a little in back for the cables and up top for the paper output, but it fits easily in my somewhat small under-desk printer stand.<br /><br />The toner cartridges are in a fairly simple tray system, and you can access all four of them (cyan, yellow, magenta, and black) at once.  When the time comes, replacing any of them will be trivial.<br /><br />Automatic double-sided printing is pretty nice.  You have to select it in "printer properties" before OKing a print job, but the option is easy to find once open the properties dialog.  I printed my tax returns for my records this way, and cut the amount of space they take in my file folder in half.<br /><br />I did a fair amount of research before deciding on this as a replacement for the Xerox 6110n, and ruled out some cheaper color lasers on issues of reliability and print quality.  Since my HP 4L is still running without trouble after 17 years, I have high expectations for the reliability of this printer.<br /><br /> - Gus;;5.0;;March 11, 2010;;8;;9;;0.888889

This printer is remarkable in it's simplicity.  Plug it in, and it works.  There's only one button (which doubles as a status light) that can be used to bring the printer out of stand-by or to print a test page.  There are two indicator lights that will stay off, blink, or stay lit depending on the health of the drum, and the level of toner remaining.  The plastic parts of the paper tray and toner cartridge cover seem a little flimsy, but they work well and are easy to slide in and out.  Like others have mentioned, you'll need to buy a separate USB cable unless you have one laying around already.<br /><br />Print quality, even on the most economical setting is more than satisfactory to me.  The pages come out with crisp, clean text, and the first page is always dust-free thanks to the fully enclosed paper tray.  Loading paper is a breeze, as is changing the toner cartridge and drum assembly.  The paper tray ha those little sliders to adjust for different sized paper and they seem to work well, however, I've only ever used the 8.5" x 11" and the envelope adjustments.<br /><br />I did run into the problem of the "starter" toner cartridge prematurely running low like other reviewers have.  Brother says the starter cartridge is supposed to print 250 pages, but I only got about 150 out of mine.  I did however try the trick where you place a piece of tape over the clear toner window to prevent the printer from recognizing the toner level.  This worked well, and my printer has been printing for weeks (granted, not all that often) with no fading or missing ink.<br /><br />Conclusion: For what I paid, I couldn't be happier.  However, if I paid the current $155 + $12 shipping, I may be inclined to move the star rating down to 4.;;5.0;;May 25, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0

Mechanically it held up just fine and I would have given it 5 stars except for the actual printing.  With this type of printer, when you change the ink cartridge you do not replace the print head.  As a result you can replace all of the ink and still have poor printing due to clogged print heads.  When you use the clean cycle to fix the problem, the printer uses large quantities of ink.  Therefore you have to watch each page for streaking and run the clean cycle when that happens. Then you MUST run a print check because it may take two or three cleaning cycles to get the printer back to normal.  I had to baby sit this machine throughout my production run.  It is now being sent off to a donation center.  I don't want it around.  Ultimately it cost me more in ink for cleaning, lost prints due to streaking then my old HP ink jet with a single cartridge would have.;;3.0;;August 11, 2010;;4;;5;;0.8

Windows 7 and Snow Leopard too!;;Let me start by saying that this is my first review of any product anywhere. I felt that I should write this because I always read user reviews before buying anything, and I find them very helpful. I must say that this printer is outstanding. I first contacted Brother support via e-mail to find out if this printer is compatible with Windows 7, both 32 bit and 64 bit, and also with Apple's Snow Leopard 10.6.2. They responded within 24 hours and assured me that it was, with down-loadable drivers from the Brother Solutions Center download page. So I took the plunge and made the purchase.<br />  My printer was delivered by FedEx, a day late (as usual). I like UPS so much better, but am not faulting Amazon or Brother for this. I set up the printer as per the quick start guide and turned it on. So far so good. Here comes the best part. I called Brother's technical support line to ask for assistance in downloading the driver's and software package and installing it on my systems. An initial wait time of about fifteen minutes kinda sucked, but let me tell you, these techs at Brother are top notch. I had a Windows 7 tech walk me through the install on the 64 bit system, then the 32 bit system, without a hitch at all. They then transferred my call to an Apple expert who did the same for me. I was up and running within the hour! Wirelessly and all! Amazing!<br />  Then I got to play with it for a while. I wasted some paper trying out the scan, copy, and print features, but it was worth it. Fax works great also. The printer is compact but heavy! I set it all up by myself, but a second set of hands would help. The printer is relatively quiet for a laser. Black is BLACK! Color is beautiful and vibrant, and best of all it works perfectly on all my systems, PC and Mac!<br />  I have to say that the Brother support techs were so very good. They all spoke clear English and were easy to understand. They were all very knowledgeable about the machine and the various OS I had. Thumbs up all the way.<br />  I had considered a Samsung CLX-3175FW wireless color laser, but the limited Mac support pushed me away. I called their customer service line to ask the compatibility issue and was told "I'm pretty sure it works with the Mac." Pretty sure?? No thanks! This printer replaced a Dell 968 wireless All In One. This printer would not play nice with the Mac or with 64 bit Windows 7. Dell's tech support is the worst. Long waits and unrecognizable dialects. This MFC-9320CW was THE answer! Hands down!;;5.0;;December 4, 2009;;67;;67;;1.0

It arrived 6/2/11.  Loved that.  Got started right away.  First night wireless setup to wireless router went relatively smooth.  Not knowing the wireless router WPA Key password was just about the only hick-up.  Spent the first weekend loading the print and scan drivers to MAC OS X 10.6 and PC WIN 2000.  Problems began.  The MAC loading went relatively smooth.  The PC loading became frustrating.  I think more so because I did not know all the network lingo so setup errors were made which created more frustrating errors.  Spent the second weekend working on the PC setup errors.  Finally things started to operate as advertised.  I began to realize a few network settings on the Brother were best if they were changed from the default setting, and the network settings on the PC were not matching up with what the Brother was set to.  Now everything operates as advertised.  So far no paper jams experienced.  I use 11x17 scan all the time.  It saves me time on how many scans I need to do if I am scanning multiple receipts, pics, or docs.  Fax works better than expected.  Love the fax preview feature.  It saves on paper.  Absolutely love the distinctive ring feature which makes for a hands-off approach to receiving faxes.  The telephone line stays plugged in, and I never have to worry if the call is a fax or a person.  The distinctive ring feature does all the work.  Copy quality is 97% exact to the original copy with standard settings.  Print speed is slow to start, however cranks out the remaining sheets fairly quickly.  In fact, the pages literally shoot out of the printer so be sure the output "stop guide" is engaged.  Love the PaperPort software.  Makes document and photo manipulation/correction a cinch.  Used the Brother to help me scan/compile my documents for a loan application.  Was able to compile and send all requested documents in easy to view, read, and secure PDF format the same day the documents were requested.  The Brother is loaded with more features than advertised.  Unlike other machine features which are additional, these extras actually come in handy and are useful time/money saving features.  Love the mechanical design.  Love the front loading placement of the ink cartridges.  Love the easiness and cleanliness of inserting and replacing the ink cartridges.  No ink replacements have been necessary yet.  It's size is as advertised, however it fits on the home-office table exactly where the previous fax machine was located.  So not feeling the pinch for space.  Overall: the only regret--not having bought the MFC-J6710DW as it has dual paper tray capability.  Not because use of the machine is so often, but because scratch paper is used to save on cost of printing on regular paper.  Had I bought the MFC-J6710DW, scratch paper would be loaded in one tray, while regular paper would be loaded in the second tray.  Hence, eliminating the need to swap in/out scratch & regular paper.;;4.0;;June 12, 2011;;54;;55;;0.981818

Setup was a breeze on the Beautiful Wife's (BW ) computer -- it took all of 5 minutes, including USB connection. Print quality is superb -- the black characters are crisp and clear and color, so far, is excellent. I haven't yet done any high-end color printing on it and I'll return to review that if there are any problems. The automatic 2-sided printing feature is a very handy thing to have but remember you have to set that up in the toolbox.  I also set up the wireless connection with my computer and that too was flawless. Just remember to enter the correct network security code one time and you're good to go. I really like the lower cost of Kodak ink, much cheaper than HP's which is just about the costliest fluid on the planet.<br />One negative: it's somewhat noisy on startup -- clanking and clicking for several seconds before starting to print. Other than that, I feel it's a quality printer that'll last the BW a good long time.<br /><br />UPDATE January 29, 2011:  After the BW & I have used this printer for nearly a month, we're both quite pleased. Print quality is very good, and the document scanning is superb! It's actually a better printer than my failing HP C5280 which is destined for the scrap yard soon. Another reviewer wrote about extreme difficulty with scanning wirelessly so I tried it from my upstairs PC using Photoshop. The printer showed up in the "acquire" menu and scanning began within 15 seconds of my request. And -- huge surprise -- BOTH sides of the scanned item appeared in Photoshop as separate images. I have no idea how that was done, as I didn't do any flipping, but c'est la vie.<br />In all, a very nice medium-duty, all around printer.;;4.0;;December 28, 2010;;5;;5;;1.0

I've had mine for over a year, and while a little frustrating at times, it does produce acceptable prints.  However, the cost of operation is a wallet breaker.  Fortunately, I purchased a CIS (continuous ink system) listed here on Amazon, and now I print without fearing that I'll be running up a huge ink bill.  I'd guess that my ink costs are now about 10 to 15% of what they used to be.  If you covet the big printers but can't justify the cost, and you've been afraid of going broke feeding the less expensive alternatives, this combo may be your answer.  You can find a CIS on here for less than the cost of a set of cartridges, but you need to be mechanically "handy" to install them.  If that isn't you, remember patience goes a long way towards acheiving success, and that mechanically incined friends can usually be bribed to help with an offer of food.;;4.0;;December 2, 2010;;5;;5;;1.0

The wireless setup is painfully simple (assuming you have a compatible router...) and I was able to fully set it up in under 10 minutes.  Printing from my Dell laptop, my fiance's Mac Book Pro, and our iPhones has been incredibly simple and I love the fact that we can place this unit somewhere out of the way and not clutter our desks with it.  To that end, the small footprint of the unit makes it easy to place just about anywhere in your house/apartment/dorm room/etc.  Scanning and copying functionality are both quick and clear- this thing would be a bargain at $100.00<br /><br />To balance the review slightly- this is not the fastest printer on the market, obviously, but for the price and functionality you cannot ask for a more reliable, easier to use printer.;;5.0;;May 14, 2011;;17;;17;;1.0

Brother DR-420 drum is $ 69-74, 12,000 pages. When replacing the gougy-priced drum, it's sometimes cheaper to buy an entire HL-2230 or HL-2240 printer on sale for $70 or less (includes DR-420 drum and a 700 page starter cartridge).<br /><br />Toner refill powder: $8-12 (assume 3000 copies -- average 0.30 cents per copy). Starter cartridge requires Flag Gear Kit, about $3-6 (one time).<br /><br />Printer comes with drum and 700 page starter toner.

The black toner alone is $51.  Decent # of pages out of a toner cartridge. I have had this printer just over a year and its pretty much dead.  Never got the networking to work.  There is a toner waste cartridge in it that has needed to be replaced 2 times in the past year at $30 a pop. It does not give a warning the waste bin is getting full and the printer wont work utill its replaced, you can only order replacement online. I never could afford to get the color replaced at $150. I have a Windows 7 computer - everytime the printer has been unplugged from it (from moving my desk, etc) I have had to reinstall all the drivers to get it to work. The smart panel on the driver never works and freezes up constantly.  After about 6 mo of having the printer it started this "thing" where everytime I go to print I have to open and close the front panel for it to print...every single time.  Now the final straw for this printer was a message to replace the imaging unit. Dont even know what the imaging unit is, but it sounds expensive. It decided to give me that message just after I replaced the toner which is not useless. The troubleshooting guide only shows you how to remove a paper jam.  This was my first and last Samsung anything.  My inlaws have a samsung fridge thats less than 2yrs old and has had to be serviced twice and the icemaker still doesnt work correctly.;;1.0;;December 6, 2011;;16;;19;;0.842105

I had previously owned another Samsung compact color laser printer (I forget which model) which I lost in a divorce and I was very pleased with it too.<br /><br />The color printing quality is really nice. I've printed several photo's and have them framed and hung up on the walls in my house, that's how nicely this prints color. After a year I still haven't had to replace the ink.<br /><br />Another thing I love about this printer is its compact size. It's (I'm estimating) around 16"x16" so it doesn't take up a ton of room in a small space.<br /><br />One thing I didn't like was that the instructions in the little book were very confusing (at least to me) when it came to getting it to run wireless. I finally figured it out, but, I wish the instruction booklet was a bit more clear for people who are not tech-savvy.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great printer for the price and will do just about anything you want if you are an average home computer user.

(Note: On lesson learned was that if you would like the convenance of scanning images or pages at the printer and automatically sending the scanned files to your computer, you will need to install the Printing software that come on a disk with the printer.  Otherwise, you can place the image/page on the printer and then go to your Mac and used  Apple provided "Image Capture" software to control the scanning and capture of the image to your Mac.)

Crisp, colorful - exactly what I'd hoped. And, it's reasonably quiet. Double-sided printing works perfectly (though it does slow output). Contrary to what the previous reviewer said, I am offered the option to print double-sided on every document, in every application. (And you can buy the toner right here on Amazon.)<br />However, the scanner is a nightmare. It takes 15 clicks for every scanned document to set up a "scan profile", choose your options, point the machine to the destination folder, get assigned a "shortcut" (ha!) for that scan job, then you go to the scanner, key in the shortcut on the machine itself, wait for the scan, then go back to the computer, click "launch" on the profile you created, and once again, point the machine to your destination folder.<br />It would be one thing if you had to do all this once to set it up, but I can tell you after 4 long calls with tech support, that you must do this for every scan.  Hello? I typically scan 10-20 items/day. Can you imagine doing that whole sequence 20 times.<br />I'm running this on a Mac, but when I saw the problem, I installed it again in Windows 7 Ultimate, running via Parallels. Same outcome. No difference. And it's not even clear if the company expects any better than this.(No one has said, "holy cow, it's not supposed to work this way".)<br />Finally, Lexmark is the only company I've dealt with in 20+ years as an active computer user, to insist you allow their tech support people to remotely take over your computer (to try fixing it themselves). If you don't agree online to a license for them to do it, they won't help you.<br />Security anyone?<br />Great printer (thus 3 stars, rather than one). Terrible Scanner.<br />p.s.

Where it matters, there isn't much of a difference between the MG6220 and the MG5220. In my book, that's a good thing. The MG5220 is already an amazing home printer so I'm glad Cannon didn't mess too much with a proven formula. The print options, wireless capability, print quality and basic layout are pretty much the same. I'm running OSX 10.5.8 and have had no real issues setting it up and using this peripheral. It took about 45 minutes from the un-boxing, through the calibration, to after the drivers installed before it was up and running. Responsiveness seems to be improved, and functionality is as good or better than the previous model. The new centralized layout and incorporated buttons are nice, but don't really give much more of an advantage over the old configuration. It is an aesthetic improvement though, if that matters to you.<br /><br />The number of inks, removable media slots, paper handling, and the location of the paper drawers and scan bed are more or less in line with the previous model, so there are no surprises for MG5220 users. I had the opportunity test an Epson Artisan 730 alongside the MG6220. Both printers are very similar when it comes to functionality and target market, but there are a few things that set them apart. The Canon has a photo black an extra grey ink for richer black and white prints. But place two color prints side by side and they look much the same. If you want to print a lot of B&W images, then the Canon should be your choice. Set-up and use was a bit easier (for me) with the Canon, and the Epson is a heavier and larger printer, though not by much.  Both also function comparably as scanners and copiers. I've yet to test the Canon's HD movie clip or CD/DVD printing aspect, but it is nice to have that capability.<br /><br />If you want a compact printer/scanner/copier that is easy to use and has great features and image quality, then I would not hesitate to recommend the MG6220. If you are a satisfied MG5220 owner and have worn out your old printer, then this upgrade should be a no-brainer.<br /><br />~ Kort;;5.0;;October 9, 2011;;134;;152;;0.881579

When the color ink cartridge is "empty," no functions will work until the cartridge is replaced - "Color ink cartridge needs replacing.  Replace color ink cartridge. (Code 3508)."  It is not possible to print just black and white - there's no way to clear the error unless you replace the color ink cartridge.  I called customer support (India) and they told me that the printer uses some colored ink when printing black and white - I've used other brand printers without the color cartridges installed and they would print black and white/grey scale.  It's not even possible to scan a document because of the ink cartridge error message - "Your scanner is currently busy."  Don't get suckered into buying a Kodak printer because the ink is "cheaper."  All the colors are in one cartridge so if one color gets low, the rest of the cartridge is garbage.  The current color cartridge lasted less than 2 months - probably dried up because I don't print in color very often.

Finally, I couldn't exit the menu and all it does now is flash its buttons everywhere. The waste ink pad is where the ink that is used for non-printing tasks, such as ink head cleaning and borderless printing, is placed -- into an absorbent rag or sponge that holds the ink.  Regardless of how often you do borderless printing or cleaning your print heads, the printer is programmed to die once you've printed 20,000 pages.<br /><br />That's bad enough for an office "workforce" printer, but what's more is that I really don't think I printed 20,000 pages.  I mean, this is just a household printer.  Sure, members of the family print from this for maps, articles and schoolwork, but we're not printing 200-page business books or anything.  I can guess that the little counter built in the printer is inaccurate.<br /><br />The scanner will not work either when this happens.  Fax too.  Good luck removing your cartridges too.<br /><br />Customer service acknowledges that the printer self-destructs at 20,000 pages.  Just hope that you get to this death message before your 12 months of warranty are up.<br /><br />So if this is for the office DO NOT BUY IT.  If this is for a large family DO NOT BUY.  If it is for you and one or two people, it will be ok for a few years, until you reach that self-destruct limit.  If you think you'll never print 20,000 pages, be my guest and buy this.<br /><br />Furthermore, the stuff you probably already know:<br />PROS:<br />Fast printing, good color and photo printing, good text quality, large paper capacity, excellent scanner, doesn't jam much<br /><br />CONS:<br />Print head jams quite often (making streaks in your prints), uses a lot of ink, ink is expensive, macintosh cannot use both paper trays, send-email function cannot print double sided or with both paper trays and is limited to 10mb files.<br /><br />If it didn't have a self-destruct mechanism, I would give it 2-3 stars.<br /><br />The fact is that all these positive Amazon reviews are subject to a bias -- they perhaps have not had the printer as long as I've had it or have not printed 20,000 pages and do not know that the printer will terminate itself in the next few months/years.  Trust me, if any of these 5 star reviewers (who are the reason I bought this in the first place) encounter the same "problem" I've encountered, they wouldn't be giving this 5 stars.  However, by the time their printer dies no one will care about this old model of printer anymore.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE GOING TO PRINT A LOT, DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER<br /><br />If you don't believe me, Google it.  The semi-good news is that there is a reset utility, but you must provide your printer serial number which will void any warranty.  The bad news is that it's a pain and not worth it, because it only extends your printer life by a ~hundred pages before you have to do it again.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Epson has given me a new 845 workforce, citing that my life duty cycle ended before the 20,000 pages for some reason (as I suspect the internal counter was inaccurate).  All I had to do was wait for the replacement printer and then ship the broken printer in the same box with the included FedEx label.  But still, 20,000 page LIFE duty cycle??  That just means this new printer will die in a year or so.  Boo!;;1.0;;June 16, 2012;;129;;145;;0.889655

I loved and used that printer for years until the carriage strap snapped.  Because of my many years of satisfaction with the predecessor, I opted to stay with HP Photosmart.  I loved that while everyone else was constantly buying and replacing cartridges, I only had to replace the colors that were used up - what a concept!  The newer model also printed on heavier stock paper that used to jam the old one.  The printer was fairly easy to set up, the quality is good and it does what I need, BUT the cost of the cartridges and page yield make it almost too expensive to use, and I do not print that many photos.  I have tried both the standard cartridges and the XLs and do not notice a significant increase in the yield.

Other reviews delve into the more esoteric topics such pigment vs dye ink, but for people trying to decide if a printer like this is worth it?  Yes definitely! This is the first time I've been able to generate prints that actually do justice to what my dSLR produces. This is the first time that the prints look as good or better on paper as they do on my PVA LCDs.<br /><br />Gorgeous color reproduction, fast printing, no visible flaws even in 13x19 prints.  Just make sure you use quality paper (and images w/ enough detail), and that you have space to set up this huge machine.<br /><br />Fully extended, the printer covers nearly half of an IKEA desktop, about 33" at its maximum size (plus extra clearance) with the back feed opened up, or 27" normally.  Fortunately, most paper can be fed from the top feed at the smaller 27" configuration (no added clearance needed), and the trays all fold into the unit for storage-- useful since the trays would probably break if one of my household felines sat on them.<br /><br />Prints will only be as good as the paper you use.  I've tried and been very pleased with 3rd-party Kodak Glossy Premium Photo Paper (use the paper setting Kodak specifies on the package) and also Canon Photo Paper Plus Semi-Gloss, 13 x 19 Inches.  Vendors claim the best print longevity is when you use their papers and inks (for the latter paper, that's 25 years under glass, 100 years in storage).  Regardless, definitely use quality paper to get results worthy of this printer's abilities.<br /><br />Software installs and runs without issue on Windows XP.  The straight-forward bundled Easy-PhotoPrint EX is very similar to the Easy-PhotoPrint that ships with smaller Canon printers.<br /><br />My only real hesitation is the price and longevity of the supplies (eg, ink).  There's a large number of smallish ink tanks (8), but they can be individually replaced.  My primary complaint here is that the software only specifies that the ink level is "adequate".  So after doing a 13x19 print, and 4 8.5x11's, I don't know how many more I have until I have to buy more ink.  It seems a percentage-remaining wouldn't be that hard to do.<br /><br />Highly recommended.;;5.0;;December 29, 2009;;28;;29;;0.965517

The printer is excellent - great quality and features in a tough package. I love receiving my daily Motley Fool Newsletter from ePrint automatically. The scanner multipage feed and two-sided print is great. Installation of the hardware went according to the directions (with some guesses). The on-screen display and keyboard give me all the information needed with the WiFi connected indicator letting me know that it's ready.<br /><br />The reason for the 3 of 5 star rating is the problems with connectivity. I use the printer via WiFi for my desktop and laptop. Frequently and intermittently, I get an error message on the laptop that print did not work. Yet while that message is staring at me in two windows, the printout is coming out just fine. Also, sometimes the scan process works great and other times it does not work at all. In both cases, the desktop does not recognize that the printer or scanner is available. This cost me over 5 hours working with the HP Help Center, to no avail. Their multitude of diagnostic software identified issues, but resolved none of them. Many 'uninstall/reinstalls' did nothing. Sometimes everything works perfectly; other times not at all. Also, the problem appears to be only with my desktop. The printer functions perfectly with my laptop. HP Help Center tried saying that the problem is with my desktop. They were embarrassed when I told them that it is an HP Desktop while the working laptop is a Dell. Also, these problems do not go away after switching to Ethernet from WiFi. The main difference between the laptop and desktop is that the former is on the network via WiFi while the desktop is wired to the router. It would cost me money and performance to attach the desktop via WiFi (added card), but I am curious as to whether that is the issue.<br /><br />I really don't want to return the printer. It has all of the features and strength that I want; however, it is frustrating to not have function when you need it.<br /><br />HP needs to improve their software development! Clearly it is lacking in software quality control! Total connectivity via a home network is a complex process that HP has not yet conquered.<br /><br />UPDATE JANUARY 23, 2012:<br /><br />After over 5 hours with the HP Help Center, not arriving at a solution to the printing errors and scanning problems, I was ready to return the printer to HP. However, I persevered. The printing was perfect as long as I did not let the error messages bother me. The scanner was not functional. Then a few days ago, I came up with an idea. IPv6 has  been in the news lately due to the lack of internet addresses under IPv4. I wondered if my laptop and desktop were using the same IP versions. Sue enough, the laptop that did not have problems was using IPv4 and the desktop had IPv4 and IPv6 activated. So, I disabled IPv6. Ever since, the printing errors have disappeared and the scanning functions perfectly! YEAH!<br /><br />I am not ready to declare 'VICTORY' yet, but after a few days, everything is still good. So, I will raise the product rating from 3 to 4. Too bad that the HP Help Center and their diagnostic software could not have saved me so many hours of frustration.<br /><br />UPDATE JANUARY 27, 2012:<br /><br />VICTORY! VICTORY!<br /><br />Since implementing the solution of IPv4 above, I have not seen a single error message for print or scan. The device is working just great. At some point, after a long period of stability, I may test whether IPv6 alone works as well as IPv4 on a home IPv4 network. For now, I am enjoying the printer. I hope that you do not have to suffer my experience.;;4.0;;January 15, 2012;;43;;43;;1.0

Now I can send print jobs to my printer from anywhere in the world! :)<br />The new firmware version is 20110826.<br /><br />FIRST: A comment on AirPrint with iOS<br /><br />This printer is capable of doing AirPrint from iOS 4.3 once the printer's firmware is updated.<br /><br />I have tested with iOS 4.3 and HP CP1025NW Firmware version 20110512 which is available on HP's website. I bet it works with iOS 4.2 as well but have not tried. I do not know if AirPrint works with older firmware but I doubt it because the release notes said "enables airprint".<br /><br />The link to HP's website doesn't always work and the firmware download page sometimes shows incorrect information. :( Also the release notes do not always show up correctly. BUT if you get a firmware file with "20110512" somewhere in the file name you got the right one.<br /><br />The firmware cannot be updated using OSX, so you need to find yourself a windows computer, install the CP1025NW driver software package, then use the firmware update tool. The firmware update tool works over WiFi, which was a major plus for me.<br /><br />This printer is also supposed to gain HP ePrint functionality with a future firmware upgrade, but that firmware was originally promised late 2010 so don't hold your breath. Multiple people have already complained about this delay on the HP forums, and some have suggested that the update may never arrive. Well the AirPrint update arrived even though it was never promised--so perhaps ePrint will arrive soon.<br /><br />Firmware version 20110512 does NOT enable HP ePrint BUT does enable Apple AirPrint.<br /><br />Some other observations on the printer:<br /><br />1. The first page prints almost instantly, but there is a noticeable lag between the 1st and 2nd page. Quick-1-page-print is a touted feature but they don't really advertise that it comes at the cost of a delayed 2nd page!<br /><br />2. By default, the printer "calibrates" the color every 48 hours, giving YOU delays in printing. I don't know why this procedure has to be repeated so often but it can be changed in the settings.<br /><br />3. Unpacking was a bit weird, because they have two orange tabs (shipping protectors?) inside the printer that you must remove. The instructions were VERY clear but it was still a bit unnerving to reach in and yank out the orange tabs with brute force.;;5.0;;June 15, 2011;;15;;16;;0.9375

One person mentioned that they had to set different file names for each scan. I did not find that to be the case. For scanning, go to Programs -> HP -> HP Laserjet 1210 Series -> Scan to  the program asks for the name once, scan your documents, after each one, it will ask if you have another one to scan. It appends a number to each with the file name you entered. Other than a test, I haven't done any faxing.<br />If you just do casual printing, there is no need to buy the flimsy color inkjet all in one printers.

So, I began researching for my next wide-format printer.  Although this one is a sleeper and not highly publicized, I am really impressed with this printer.  It is simple and easy to set up and operate and, it produces flawless beautiful photos with no metamerism like I experienced with the old Epson 2200.  This one doesn't have any fancy bells and whistles, but, it just works and, it works well.  The only thing I don't care for is the printing software that comes with it because, it takes forever to do its thing; "s-l-o-w" doesn't begin to describe the Easy Print software. It eventually works and, works well, but someone needs to fix that software to speed it up.  I love that when you print a document using Word, it prints the last page first so that the document stacks itself in order and is ready to go when the print job is finished. Also, the text is just as clear as any laser printer.  Another huge plus I like is, this printer, so far, does not seem to be an ink hog.  And, the multi-packs of ink for this printer are very reasonably priced.  I've printed several letter size photos, some 4X6 snapshots, and some gorgeous 13X19 photos -- the ink levels are still near the top!  As is always the case, the cyan and magenta levels come down first but, surprisingly, they are only down a bit, the yellow and blacks are still at the top. Another thing I like is the printer shuts itself off after its been idle for awhile, that's an energy saving plus that I really appreciate.  For all around everyday printing, along with art gallery quality photo printing, this was the perfect printer for me. I am favorably impressed and very satisfied with this purchase.;;5.0;;July 7, 2011;;57;;58;;0.982759

Just followed the (very clear) instructions, and when the printer set-up was ready, I just printed from the computers, selected Epson Workforce 545, which then prompted me to download the installation program from Apple (I didn't need any USB cable, and didn't use the CD installation either). Two minutes later, the print-out came out. Setting up the Fax line was also a breeze. You will only need the USB cable to Scan. Unfortunately, scanning using OCR with this printer will only work on Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5.

My previous two were both HP.  With the purchase of this Canon machine I was replacing an HP C6180 which was 3 years old.  The HP machines I've had were both slow and very noisy and the scanning software was buggy.  So I was generally dissatisfied with the HP equipment, but the issue that brought about the replacement was a clogged print head.  After several support calls with HP, I finally got to a technician who knew enough to conclude the print head was clogged and needed replacement.  When I asked for a referral to a repair facility, or the number for an HP repair depot, I was told "These machines are not designed to be repaired, they are designed to be replaced and recycled."  I asked to speak to a manager, and when he called back a day later I was told the same thing.  So I called the office of the CEO of HP in California, and was referred to another organization who said the same thing.  Then I called a local independent printer repair shop and was told "the print heads in the HP all-in-ones are not replaceable, and that I should consider buying a new machine. For want of a $0.10 print head, the entire device had to be scrapped.  Now Eco-friendly is that ?!?!?!?<br /><br />Since I was generally dissatisfied with the HP all-in-one's I had owned I decided to temper my brand bias and research the field and make an informed decision based on other user reviews.  This lead me to Epson and Canon.  The newer HP equivalent replacement model I tried at an Office Depot and it was as slow and noisy as my previous two HP machines.  While there, I looked at the Epson models, and while I liked their photo printing capability, I was more interested in low-duty-cycle printing and not having to scrap the machine when the ink dried out when I was traveling.  The Epson machine does not have a replaceable print head, and I had read a review here on Amazon that the Canon machine did have a replaceable print head.  So sight unseen, I ordered the Canon.<br /><br />The reviews are correct when they give high praise to the Canon Pixma line.  I have been delighted with the performance and it's significantly less noisy than all the others.  What really has impressed me is the scanning with the automatic document feeder - it's flawless.  The HP could never scan more than 3 pages with the ADF without the software crashing or the wireless connection faltering and creating errors.  With the Canon, it has worked like a dream and in less than an hour I've scanned in twenty years of income tax returns - something that would have taken a day to accomplish with the HP.<br /><br />Setup was easy and the wireless connection worked from the first try.  I've used the machine now to fax, scan, copy and print and I'm very satisfied.  During installation I discovered that the print head is indeed separate - you have to install it as part of the ink cartridge installation, and it's offered as a spare part that the user can easily replace.  Printing is about twice the speed as the HP machine I tried in the store that's in the same price bracket.<br /><br />I have not tried using this printer for photo finishing.  I have a high end Epson I use for that which handles 11x17 inch media.  My guess is the Epson is better for photos because it has more ink colors and they are generally known as the photo printing leader.  But the ink cartridges are more expensive to replace since there are more colors involved.<br /><br />I would also comment that the software for the Canon machine comes with the device and needs installation.  I'm using a Mac and support for the Epson and HP machines is part of Snow Leopard operating system.  But the software installation was easy and the Apple OS discovered that there was an update for it and downloaded it and installed it automatically without a hitch.  The only thing I would like to see added or improved would be an ability to fax directly from the computer (HP supports this, Epson and Canon don't).  But this is a minor issue compared with having a machine that in all daily use categories exceeded my expectations by a large margin.  It's still is astounding to me that such a useful and functional piece of equipment as this is under $200.  After this experience, my brand preference for inkjet office printers/scanners is now Canon.;;5.0;;May 10, 2010;;69;;69;;1.0

I wanted a wide format printer, but was not at all impressed with the HP wide format printer that I got a year or so back.  I had narrowed my choice down to the Canon Pixma Pro9000 or the Epson Stylus Photo R1800.  I really wanted the ability to both print directly on CDs/DVDs and produce professional quality photographs.  The Epson R1800 did both.  The Canon Pro9000, though, did not have the CD/DVD printing capability.  However, I was concerned about the reports of Epson's ink guzzling and print head clogging.  I actually bought an Epson inkjet printer some years back and returned it because of the huge ink consumption.<br /><br />I ultimately decided on the Canon printer, and could not be happier.  The prints are incredible.  I'd say that they are as good if not better than professional prints.  The printer requires eight different ink cartridges, two of which are photo cartridges.  I've used up the photo cartridges much faster than the others, but would certainly not describe the printer as ink guzzling.<br /><br />After I got the printer, I discovered, much to my delight, that the Canon Pro9000 actually has the capability to print on CDs/DVDs.  However, that feature is turned off on the US printers, supposedly because of some agreement between Canon and Epson.  I was able to locate and purchase the "E" tray that comes with the Canon Pro9000 printers sold in Europe.  In addition, I found both instructions on how to convert the US Canon printer to a European Canon printer so that it can print on CDs/DVDs, and software that could be downloaded to accomplish all of this.  I can now produce professional looking CDs/DVDs and photographs.<br /><br />Bottom line, I could not be happier!;;5.0;;June 8, 2007;;32;;32;;1.0

After spending a small fortune over the past 6 years with two top-of-the-line Epson Photostylus inkjet printers, I'd had enough when my R1800 started chewing through 50% of the 6 ink cartridges it has just trying to get the nozzles cleaned....all at $14/cartridge.  So I did a little research and found the CP2025dn brand-new from HP.  What a joy!<br /><br />I just hung it off the home router with its network interface and leave it on 24 hours a day.  It goes into sleep mode (from which it only draws a couple of watts of power) yet it immediately wakes up begins printing within about 20 seconds.  AND it doesn't clink and clang and make all kinds of fuss: it just prints!  This is in what I would call an medium intensity home office or very intense personal use.  Four people are using it, 3 from windows, 1 mac and everyone loves it.  Using the HP glossy laserjet photopaper it even produces decent pics - not near what an R1800 would do BUT at a fraction of the cost, about 50x as fast, they're totally waterproof, and the quality is easily good enough for a school project, to mail pics to relatives, photobooks etc.  But that's not the main thing it will be used for with prints from CVS and others only costing 10 or 15 cents for a 4x6.<br /><br />Being that the inkjets seem like nothing but cash-cows for the printer manufacturers and the outrageously small number of pages that one gets out of a set of cartridges and the fact that the vast majority of printing is not for photos anyway - but day-to-day text/graphic use, laserjets seem the only way to go.  From that perspective, this feels like the best money I've ever spent on a printer and I HIGHLY recommend it - you won't be sorry.;;5.0;;January 10, 2009;;98;;101;;0.970297

Bought an HP wireless for one office and this for another because I needed a fax.  The HP was for light use, this one, slightly more.  The HP was extremely light.  Why the weight difference?  Second, this machine took quite a while to get operational.  The step-by-step instructions were crystal clear and easy to follow.  But still, there were MANY steps and it all took the better part of an hour -- test page, aligning, downloading the software, putting in the MANY ink cartridges, etc.  And it wasn't strictly me.  There were times when the machine did its thing while I waited.  The most disappointing aspect is the cheap paper drawer.  Pull out too far and it comes all the way out.  It's a light and flimsy plastic, doesn't take much paper (my Brothers took a ream, easy), doesn't have a real track.  Shockingly cheap.  (The HP wasn't much better, drawer-wise, but it was less than half the price and half the weight.)<br /><br />Those are the negatives.  So far, it's working well and, once the setup was done, was a snap to use.  Still shake my head when I reload paper (often, given the little it stores), but I can't complain about the quality of copies.  Haven't yet tried a photo.;;3.0;;June 20, 2011;;11;;13;;0.846154

I like the look, the convenience, the technology.  The setup was easy and I was connected wirelessly and having people send things directly to my printer from various places in the country within minutes.  The printer is small and looks nice and unobtrusive in the room.  But... although text documents look fine when they printed, color photos were washed out.  I had printed a couple of test photos on plain paper and they looked pretty good.  But when it came time to put in photo paper and print pictures of people with faces, the Envy 114 fell short.  The colors are washed out, yellow-tinged, and lacking in sharpness and detail.  There is a world of difference between the photos I see displayed on my monitor and what is coming out of this printer.  If most of my photos were of objects and not people, the photo quality might not be as much of an issue for me, but the poor resolution and color rendition on flesh tones means it has to go back.  One other negative - there is only one paper tray, so you can't leave both plain and photo papers loaded.;;2.0;;May 23, 2012;;13;;14;;0.928571

It was also available at stores for $49.99 at the same time on a special offer, but they were all gone.<br /><br />As a college student, I really needed a printer to do all the print jobs that were required.

I printed roughly 25 pages total with it, and about 5 envelopes over the course of 3 months. So now, when I needed again, it it decides to stop feeding all together. I messed with it a bunch trying to make it work - cleaned it, helped the pages along, etc. I wanted to print addresses on envelopes which it refused to do and that was its last straw. I popped in an envelope, which fed, jammed and shredded inside the printer. I pulled it out, and tried again, this time with just an empty envelope. It stuck and printed over top of the print and made a mess. I tired another which jammed and shredded inside the printer again. After that I took it outside and smashed it into a million pieces. I never shop a Wal-Mart because they sell garbage intentionally. They get manufacturers to make stuff that is lower quality just so they can sell it at a lower price.

Don't believe it. The "low toner" indicator comes on at around 5,000 pages, and the printed pages look fairly washed out by then. By 7,000 pages, the printed pages look too washed out to even read anymore, even with lots of toner shaking.<br /><br />This is with copying and printing text documents, many of which do not take up the full 8.5x11 area (e.g. photocopies of driver's licenses).<br /><br />There are a few other minor problems. The network drivers consume a lot of resources and are a bit squirrely. The document feeder frequently pulls through multiple pages at a time and is difficult to unjam. Mostly, though, the main problem is toner capacity. Based on the claimed toner capacity, I calculated that this printer would have very low per-page costs compared to other printers. In practice it's not nearly as economical as I thought it would be.;;1.0;;January 6, 2010;;15;;17;;0.882353

The problem is for the past several years a supported Mac driver was no longer offered, so I had to use drivers for other printers that caused issues.  Thus, my decision to finally spring for a new printer.<br /><br />There was a lot to choose from.  However, this Brother MCF-J425W stood out as an exceptional value.  I also considered a professional Brother model that printed 11x17 sized images, but the footprint of the device and height was too tall for my desk area.  This unit, while still larger than some units, fit in my tight space.<br /><br />Motivation for purchase and Pros:<br /><br />1) The brother ink cartridges do not have the ink head nor a computer chip. This makes it possible for third parties to reproduce the cartridges at insanely low prices as seen on Amazon.  With other brands, you have to have remanufactured cartridges if you want to save money (essentially refilled).  These refilled cartridges quality varies dramatically and the results are usually not worth the hassle/savings.  Therefore, your price per print on Brother (which is easy to get good third party ink) can come out insanely low compared to say HP where you probably want to stick with OEM ink.<br /><br />2) Wireless features.  Yes, most printers in this category are wireless now.  It was easy to setup and I quickly downloaded and updated the firmware on the printer to utilize Apple's Air Print from my iPhone and iPad.  Works fine.  Wish you could change settings on the phone and iPad though.  I have no idea what setting it uses when you print from a phone or tablet?  Maybe "normal?"  The other major wireless feature is Brother's own free application from the app store that lets you print and more impressively scan documents right from the phone. Therefore, if you have the printer setup away from computers and whatnot, do all the scanning work right on your phone or iPad via the brother App!  Pretty cool, though I personally have limited use for that.<br /><br />3) Price.  With the instant savings that come and go, this product was cheap to say the least.<br /><br />Observations & Disappointments upon arrival and use:<br /><br /> 1) Print Speed - They quote numbers better than my 2003 HP printer, but it feels slower.  It will take 10-15 seconds just to start printing and if you want Normal with color, it's not too fast printing either.  I've found grayscale copies on "Normal" setting are acceptable speed, though not fast.  Grayscale copies on "High," is annoying slow, and on "Best," it's impossibly slow.<br /><br />2) Print Quality - This relates back to speed.  Don't even bother with "Fast/Draft," unless it's something you are going to throw away soon and were just proofing.  Fast/Draft documents are ugly on this machine, unlike my nine year old HP.  I don't even want to read a draft on it.  The letters are all pixelated and horrible looking on this fast setting.  I refuse to use the fast setting.  I think "Normal," is closer to what draft was on my HP.  I cannot tell a difference between "High," and "Best," for text, so on the most important report, paper, or business document I would use "High."  Less important day to day things, "Normal," will probably be ok.  Too bad that "high," will take so long.  Finally, there is suppose to be an "Ink save," feature that only outlines images when printing a fast/draft, but this setting seems unavailable on Mac.  This could be made clearer.<br /><br />3) Scanning.  Scanning works fine and if you're on OS X, the built in drivers or the ones you download from Apple.com work perfect.  I can scan right from the Mac without problem.<br /><br />4) Faxing is pretty straightforward though there are many advanced settings, so be careful.<br /><br />5) No duplexing.  More and more printers offer duplexing today.  I know this is an entry range wireless, but I would have really liked to have duplexing.  In the real world though, I guess I might not use duplexing that much even if I had it.<br /><br />6) Paper Tray - The paper tray must be nearly completely removed from the printer to add paper.  It holds just shy of 100 standard sheets of paper.  While it's not horrible to replace normal paper (100 sheets will last me a while), it's mind bogglingly frustrating to swap paper, envelopes, and photo paper.  It's just too involved, the paper tray is too clunky, to do a swap quickly.  I do print envelopes at least monthly, so I find this frustrating.<br /><br />7) Photo Printing - This is not something I had planned to do with the printer as for so many years I had not had much interest.  However, with the excitement of a new printer, I got out some old HP photo paper and got going!  Wow.  There is something about seeing your photographs on glossy photo paper. It's more satisfying than on the computer screen or uploaded to the HD television.  I printed several 4x6 and one 8 1/2 x 11 photo.  Wow. The 8 1/2 x 11 photo is impressive to me, just seeing a photo that size in hand. Now, the quality.  I can't say exactly. The quality is VERY GOOD.  I wouldn't call it perfect or striking, but very nice indeed.  I would love to compare the quality to other photo printers.  This might just peak a renewed interest in photo printing for me.  It's fun.  Now, photo printing is very slow too, but that doesn't bother me because we're talking about high resolution photographs and of course photos are slow.  The 4x6 in photo or best mode seemed fairly quick though.  The 8 1/2 x 11 in best mode took about ten minutes.  Again, this doesn't bother me.  Printing a two page black and white report that takes one minute bothers me.<br /><br />Overall, the feature set of the printer for the price makes it highly attractive.  The price of third party ink (used at your own risk) and wireless features are fantastic.<br /><br />The biggest drawback for me is the print speed.  It just feels slow especially the time between clicking print and the actual beginning to print.  The second drawback is the print quality.  You have to use a higher setting for acceptable quality compared to other printers, which slows the speed down even more.  The third major drawback is the paper tray.  It's a headache to use compared to my old HP that had most of the paper tray exposed, ready to adjust and swap stock.  The final drawback is lack of duplexing.  Recommended product, but realize its drawbacks and limitations before deciding.  The true rating should be around 3.5 stars.;;4.0;;May 17, 2012;;7;;7;;1.0

I purchased this printer because I read great reviews for it, but beware if a review is written after using a printer only for a couple days or weeks. You can't really know how the printer performs in such a short time period. This printer consistently had problems with pulling in too many sheets of paper at the same time so that I would get documents with a little on one sheet of paper and the rest on another sheet of paper, sometimes 3 sheets, sometimes more. I tried various different kinds and weights of paper and it didn't matter. Many times I had to load just one sheet of paper at a time to get decent prints: a complete waste of time.<br />Also, inexplicably, often when printing multiple copies of the same document, the printer would print 3 or 4 copies fine, then for the rest of the copies, it would only print the top 1/3 of the page, or the top 2 lines of the page. Additionally, I only ever printed maybe 3 or 4 full colour pages, yet the colour ink showed it was nearly empty.<br />Before I had the printer a year, and had been suffering through all of these issues, I was going to contact Epson about the warranty. Then I read all of these horror stories about customers having huge hassles trying to get their printers serviced under warranty from Epson. In the end I decided not to even bother because I didn't need any more trouble or to waste more money on this piece of junk.<br />This has been the worst printer, the biggest headache, and the biggest waste of money ever.

After 4 hours of tech support they decided to send me a REFURBISHED printer. Remeber I paid for a new one. The replacement is not working properly either and ther suggestion is to go thru tech support again. I think I'd prefer coating myself in chocolate and lay on an ant hill. I'm told it does not work properly because it is plugged into a back up battery. It must be plugged directly into a wall outlet. For my sanity is anyone else aware that your printer shouldn't be plugged into a power strip and needs to be plugged directly into a wall outlet? Anyhow "NEVER AGAIN" for any HP product.

R8FZQ3P76HWK1;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ABVYGB2TKBO8F;;Printer;;B004HO58UW;;Canon Pixma MX882 Wireless Office All-in-One Inkjet Printer (4894B002);;A step up from the MX860;;We've had a Canon MX860 for three years. It died and was too costly to fix. That multi-function printer served us very well for three years during which time we used it quite a lot due to home schooling, and running a ministry which required quite a bit of printing each week. We appreciated all the functions, especially the duplex printing which saved paper and made our handouts smaller and less bulky. We often used the feeder to make double sided copies. We just won't buy a printer that is missing the duplex feature. The printer worked like a charm for tens of thousands of copies with perhaps two or three paper jams over the entire three years. So when it died we were happy to seek out a similar printer from Canon.<br /><br />The MX870 would have been the closest match to the now obsolete MX860, but for just a few dollars more this MX882 had a few features we liked, such as higher resolution printing and scanning, and faster throughput. This MX882 looks almost identical to the MX860 except the old one was silver and this one is shiny black. It doesn't matter to us much because it is in a slide out drawer in a cabinet. But those who will have it out where it is exposed the black might be a fingerprint magnet.<br /><br />Strangely when connecting it to our home WiFi network it gave me two choices, Easy Setup or Other Setup. I tried Easy Setup which asked me to input the password; a bit tedious of a process. But the Easy Setup failed. So I tried the Other Setup which used the automatic feature of my wireless router and it worked quickly and easily. Turns out the Other Setup was easier than the Easy Setup.<br /><br />I found the operation of the MX860 to be slightly easier to use than the new MX882 but they are very similar so this is no big deal. To me there is just a little confusion over the addition of the new Dual Function Panel, and the absence of the 2-sided button.<br /><br />We don't print photos often which it turns out is one of the great strengths of this printer. I loaded the Canon print app on my iPod Touch. It immediately and automatically found the MX882. I picked a photo and sent it to the printer. Using the supplied Canon photo paper, the photo from my iPod Touch printed out quickly. I was stunned by how great the photo came out. The colors are great and it is sharp and with high contrast. The photo is as good as anything I've seen come from a lab (and photography is one of my hobbies).<br /><br />A negative aspect of this and the older printer we had is they both will use color ink when printing greyscale. This is a waste of ink and money. We dealt with this issue on the older printer, and user comments about the MX882 indicated the same problem exists here. We just lived with it though because these printers just have too many other great features that we want.<br /><br />Another comment about ink is when printing greyscale, or copying or printing anything that is truly just black and white like a Word document, the large black cartridge is used along with the Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow, but the little back cartridge isn't used. For a while we were buying the ink multipacks with the four small tanks but we had to stop and buy individual color ink cartridges. The small black was not often being used and they were piling up in our ink storage box.<br /><br />I can't add anything about the FAX feature. On the older printer we did use the fax sparsely and it worked fine with our traditional Verizon and AT&T phone lines. However when we switched to VOIP using the Ooma Telo system (super cheap and it works great) I never could get the FAX to work well. Further I think the printer was interfering with our voice calls, causing them to drop. So, as we have little reason to fax out, and most people can email instead of fax, we just ignored this function. We don't run the phone through the printer so it won't interfere with our VOIP. I don't consider this a Canon problem but rather a VOIP issue.<br /><br />It is clear that this printer is faster than the MX860, and I suppose the MX870, because I have printed quite a number of copies of single sided sheets and a bunch of duplex tow sided sheets which perhaps 20-25% faster.<br /><br />Overall we are very pleased with our purchase. It is the only printer in operation in our house with a total of four computer using it.<br />We go through a 5,000 sheet box of paper about every six months so it is in heavy demand. We use the automatic feeder often which works flawlessly. As I indicated we also print about 1/2 our material in duplex which makes a more professional look to our handouts for the ministry, and saves paper.<br /><br />Some added comments April 23,2012.<br />For a printer that (on Amazon) advertises that it can make two sided copies from two sided originals it isn't easy to use. The MX860 had a key marked 2-Sided. The MX882 has the two sided control buried in the Print Settings menu.<br /><br />Oh and the instruction booklet is one of the worst I've seen. But I'm of the impression that to use an all-in-one if you have to revert to the manual something is wrong with the design. I did look for 2-sided printing in the manual but got frustrated with the horrible format of the manual. I finally discovered the 2-sided printing options by poking around with the actual printer. The on-screen manual is a bit easier to use, especially because one can use the serach function.<br /><br />Further comment April 26, 2012<br />I picked up the role of family tree historian along the years. I have about 2,000 photos to scan in which I've put off for many years. I've finally found the time and am a few hundred scans into it. A great feature of this printer and software is I can place multiple photos on the platen, about 1/2" apart, and the printer will scan them in as individual photo image files. This saves quite a bit of time.;;5.0;;April 20, 2012;;6;;6;;1.0

Could not scan and could not print.  After hours of unsuccessful troubleshooting, I uninstalled it and installed it again.  That was the worse thing I could do.  The printer icon disappeared from my control panel and it could not be found.  Finally called customer service and after two hours on a Saturday afternoon, such a waste, he had it up and running.

Good quality printing.<br />Cons:  1.  Compatability issues when trying to scan documents to my computer.  Very very slow.

Once I exited out of the scanning software, the free memory would jump back up to 30gb.<br />2.  No camera card reader. (HP 8600 Plus does have card readers on the front of the machine)<br />3.  Not double sided scanning. (HP 8600 Plus is double sided scanning)<br />4.  No easy to use touch screen.  (HP 8600 Plus does have touch screen)<br />5.

First issue...  It couldn't be powered through a UPS---it would immediately trip the built-in surge sensor as soon as it powered up.  I plugged it directly into the wall outlet and then realized why it was tripping the UPS:  it draws A LOT of current very quickly upon power up and then again any time you print/copy.  Every time someone would send a print to it, all of the lights in the office would flicker and dim.  Not a nice smooth type of dimming but a very annoying harsh flicker.  It appears that in order to meet Energy Star requirements the Brother engineers decided to use an instant-on type of fuser.  Unfortunately the engineers weren't able to figure out how to prevent the office lights from flickering like someone was turning vacuum cleaner on and off.  The second issue was the amount of ozone this thing produces.  We have a pretty small 400 sqft office and if someone made several copies or prints at once then the whole office would have a strong ozone smell for about 5 minutes.  Even after just one print/copy you would smell it if you were less than 10 feet away.  The last time I remember using a copier that produced that much ozone was a 1980s vintage Xerox copier.  So it was a bust on the printer but Amazon was great with the return--no issues.  We ended up buying a Canon MF5880DN and we love it.;;2.0;;June 23, 2011;;2;;7;;0.285714

Back then they offered the very best print quality.  So, it was with high hopes that I finally replaced it with this new laser printer by Brother.  I must say I am quite disappointed by the print quality.  For run-of-the-mill text printing it is fine.  But for photo quality imagery is is second rate.  My 8 year old HP G85 inkjet does a much better job.<br />  First, the colors tend to wash out.  Second, if you use photo paper, the rollers will leave streaks, even if you reset for 'thick' paper.  Lastly, especially faces, the image quality just doesn't compare to inkjet.  If you are going to print imagery, especially photos of people, I recommend you get a different printer.<br />  Also, as others have noted, printing envelopes is a hit or miss affair.  Sometimes it prints them and other times it merely faults it as a jam, although there is none, and you have to reboot.  When it does print an envelope it comes out wrinkled - always.<br />  Like other laser printers, its noisy compared to an inkjet.  However, it eventually goes into a silent sleep mode.  The only real advantage I see in this over an inkjet is the pages won't run if wet.  An advantage in legal documents and envelopes.  However, if you don't do a lot of that type printing, I'd take another look at an inkjet.  Text printing and basic graphics like pie charts or cartoon type images are equal to inkjet BUT only if you go into the print software and specify darker black or color printing.  Otherwise, it prints lighter than inkjet.  Of course, if you do that you use more toner.  So, cost savings over an inkjet is probably then lost.  However, if easy readability is not that important to you, you may be content with the default setting.;;1.0;;July 30, 2011;;3;;5;;0.6

They are all going to the dump, where they should have gone the day they arrived. I have dealt with printers since the 9 dot matrix time, so I am familiar with printer frustrations. It seems that Minolta Konica have made a list of all those things printers should NOT be and successfully manufactured them with this philosophy in mind.<br /><br />They are big, heavy, noisy (when we first turned them on we thought they were doing to explode), unreliable, slow...very slow... can take 5 minutes of "very loud," clunking to print out the first sheet only to finish off with a paper jam where bits of paper have to pulled out with tweezers for another 15 minutes, (may take longer or you may never get it out and end up with a dead printer), prone to failure on a daily basis and basically unserviceable and unusable. It asks for new toner replacements daily even if they do not need replacing. Constant recalibration (more clunking for 5 minutes) is enough to make you leave the room. Often it clunks for another 5 seconds after "every page," printed. If you have a ten page document you may as well go to the caf&eacute; to have a coffee and calm down, and hope there is not another paper jam when you get back. We are getting behind in office work with all the down time from printer malfunctions.<br /><br />If you have nothing to do in the office all day and are bored and have to give the impression you are busy doing something and feel that battling with a hopelessly implemented printer is your idea of challenging fun then Konica Minolta Magicolor printers are for you. The rest of you will need to attend anger management courses just to cope with this printer.;;1.0;;May 23, 2011;;4;;6;;0.666667

I like the convenience of having our printer in the living room, since I do so much of my computer work on the couch right there, and it is nice to be able to print things from my iPhone as well.<br /><br />Over the past couple weeks my husband and I have had to use the printer for more than just printing a coupon here or a short document there, and we have been fighting with this printer CONSTANTLY.<br />Here are the issues:<br />-it jams CONSTANTLY<br />-it is rather difficult to unjam, because it does not come apart very easily<br />-It chews up the bottom of the pages of paper even when it isn't jamming<br />-it spits the papers out onto the floor, not onto the completed document arm as it is supposed to<br />-it runs rather slow<br />-it doesn't like to operate on any setting other than default.  Not even "fast draft, black and white"<br />-it will jam on every single document set to print double-sided<br />-it randomly stops in the middle of printing to allow ink to dry.  Printers have been around for decades and haven't needed to do that, so why now?<br />-it occasionally starts printing half-way down the page, so it cuts off the bottom 1/3 to 1/2 of the page of text.<br /><br />I've had printers in the past that will act up a bit when there starts to be too little paper in the paper tray.  I'm wondering if the small paper tray (80 sheets max) is why this printer is ALWAYS having issues.<br /><br />I seriously can't even print a 6 page double sided document (3 double sided pages) without it jamming.<br /><br />The concept and the look of this product are great, but quite honestly, the quality and reliability of this printer is horrible!!!<br /><br />If you're looking for a printer that will print just the occasional coupon before you head out the door, this will probably do the job.  But if you need a real printer that actually works every time of every day on every document it is supposed to work on, look elsewhere!;;1.0;;January 22, 2012;;13;;18;;0.722222

It did connect to our wireless network and works well for that.  We have 4 computers throughout our home that use this printer.  This printer replaced an inkjet printer.  The color is a little better than the inkjet we had but don't notice the quality to be that much better than the inkjet.  I guess what has been the biggest issue is that it costs over $200 to replace the 4 toner cartridges.  And those don't last all that long.  It's like buying a whole new printer every time you run out of toner.  I plan to try refilling them to see if that can cut the cost.<br /><br />For those looking to use this for high capacity printing with most being black print, I would recommend getting a high capacity black and white printer laser jet and adding a separate color inkjet unless you just have to have laser color.  In my work office I print about 50,000 pages in a year.  Almost all of these are black print.  A good HP laser does the trick and you can find replacement cartridges very inexpensively.  I also have an inkjet that I use for the occasional color.  So for those looking for a high capacity business solution, I don't think this is such a good choice since the replacement cartridge cost is too high.<br /><br />One other issue with this printer is that it plays havoc with our electric system in the room.  Every time the printer gears up to print, the lights all dim and flicker.  If I have my radio on it cuts off.  Not sure why that is.  My previous inkjet did nothing like that. Never had a problem.<br /><br />Bottomline, I would not have purchased this printer for my home office knowing what I know now.  And definitely would not purchase for a high capacity solution in a work environment.;;2.0;;March 27, 2010;;5;;8;;0.625

This printer is for someone who cranks out primarily black and white office type documents with an occasional color pie chart or color logo. I only had one choice of a 600 DPI setting when printing a jpg.flyer on regular paper stock. I have a problem with machines that "think for you" and automatically adjust settings due to paper weight. I want to be able to configure the print outcome however I want and this printer is absolutely not capable of that. I don't like the interface either.

It took about 15 minutes.  The longest part was updating the driver and firmware.  Physically setting up the printer took about 2 minutes.<br /><br />I have an old Epson that wouldn't behave.  Just getting the printer to work with Windows 7 with the latest drivers was hit or miss.  The Kodak 2170 was a breeze to connect to the computer.  I actually have it connected to 2 computers over wifi.  The printer actually connects to your router.<br /><br />I work at home so having a machine that can print, scan, fax, and copy is pretty important to me.  I mainly have the printer to scan documents.  It saves the documents in jpeg or pdf.  The old Epson only scanned to jpeg.  It probably does PDF too, but I never got it to work.  It just never wanted to connect to the computer in the first place.  The major plus of this all in one is that it has a document feeder.  If you're going to scan multiple pages, this is a huge plus.<br /><br />Overall, I like it because it was easy to set up and does what I need it to do.  The downside is that it's a big printer.  Right now, it's consuming about 1/3 of my desk space.  Since it's wifi, I'll probably relocate it to the other room.;;5.0;;August 18, 2011;;2;;5;;0.4

When I plugged the printer in, it asked me for the wireless key, etc, which I gave. At no point did it ask me to choose usb versus wireless. At the end of the set-up, I was left with the usb cord in my hand, wondering. So I called "technical support." Big mistake. She walked me through the installation I had already completed. Insisted I could, indeed, use the usb. But when we were done, I still had the cord, unattached, in my hand. She said it shouldn't matter. But it did to me.<br /><br />Now let's talk about speed: there isn't any. This machine "processes" forever. I waited almost a full two minutes yesterday for a one-page report from Quicken. The machine was polite, however. It did ask me to "wait," since it was "processing." Really?<br /><br />Reliability: again, there isn't any. Today the printer doesn't print. It pulls power, I can see it blinking over there on the shelf. But I'm told that the printer is "unavailable" -- perhaps it's just exhausted from all its processing yesterday.<br /><br />I was really happy with my Canon MP530, which worked flawlessly for about 5 years until one day, it didn't. I was hoping for hapiness with my new Canon. But it's not to be.<br /><br />And, oh, the return period for Amazon expired yesterday, so I'll just have to duke it out with Canon.

There are tiny pictures on the box of what is included, and a picture of a USB cable is not there, but it's reasonable to think something like this would come with everything you need to make it work, since every other printer on the planet does (at least the 10 or so we've owned have).<br /><br />I know it only costs $29 and the ink is cheap, but this is ridiculous.

What's wrong with this printer? Well, everything. It is absolutely the worst, most cheaply made and poorly designed printer I have ever owned, and I have been buying and using printers for over 20 years. About a month after I bought it, the scanning bar got stuck and wouldn't move.  Days later, it started to work again. Then it would get stuck. The paper mis-feeds and jams are constant. You are lucky if you can print three pages without a jam. Then there is a grinding and shuttering, errors, etc. This grew so annoying that I figured that giving the printer a whack might help. It did. I felt better. The printer wasn't any better off, though. I started whacking it around a little more. Same effect. After I owned it for about two months, it had reason to sue me for printer abuse, yet it kept on ticking, being the admirable little trooper that it was. It kept grinding and shuttering away, begging me not to hurt it, but after about three months of printer-human mayhem, I decided that it was not worthy of my pity. After it hit the ground, (I unplugged it first), the control panel popped out and it shed an ink cartridge or two, proudly revealing its internal organs. Services are pending.

We had bought a Brother printer before but wanted to upgrade to an Airport compatible printer. Our big mistake was buying the new printer before the old printer had run out of ink.  We used the old printer ink up while the new one sat in the box for a while, so it is not possible to return it at this point.<br /><br />With our first Brother, all we did was plug it in, connect it to the wifi and we were set. Not so with this one. First, it said we needed to download new drivers.  Once we downloaded them, it said they weren't the right ones, even though ther were only two options for Macs.  Finally, we got the drivers to work but we had to install software onto the computers. Ok, whatever.<br /><br />After all this garbage, we finally get the Airport working and we can print from our iPhones and iPads. Yea!  Except, the first time I try, bam, paper jam.  Fix it, happens again.  What the...?  After multiple paper jams, finally get the paper printing smoothly but.....nothing on the page. That's right, the printer is broken. We did not handle it roughly or drop it or anything, it is simply broken. The machine goes through the motions like it is printing but when the page comes out, it's blank. It's as if there is no ink in the cartridges, except we know there is as they are the ones that came with the printer and we have NEVER used them as the &$@# printer has never printed a single page!!!!!<br /><br />Fortunately, our old Brother printer still works so I will be going to the store to get new printer cartridges.  We have to chalk up this new printer as lessons learned, just a $99 mistake. I am so disappointed and upset, what a pain in the butt. As I said, I am glad others have had better luck but know that there are some lemons out there.  Buy this model with caution and save your receipt.;;1.0;;March 21, 2012;;4;;11;;0.363636

Unfortunately Xerox no longer manufacture it or a similar machine. Researching whats available I selected the Canon D 420. The copier arrived promptly from J&R and after unpacking and setting it up and turning it on I got an error message to re install the toner and the paper. After doing that  several times I called Canon tech support. I then spent about 45 minutes of trouble shooting on the phone to no avail. I was advised to either take the NEW machine to a Canon repair center (an hour trip from where I am) or return it to the vendor. I called the vendor and got a Return Authorization number and instructed that it be replaced with a same model machine. I then spent another hour re packing the copier and then lugging it to the UPS store for the return trip. This whole exercise took close to 4 hours of my time. The replacement machine arrived two weeks later and believe it or not the exact same scenario as described above took place. Another defective product, another 4 hours of my time wasted again.  All in all I wasted the equivalent of a full working day on this copier. I am returning the machine except this time I am asking for a refund. I have owned Canon products and still do, cameras, scanner, printer, with happier experiences. I can only attribute the problems with this machine to either Canon's poor design or poor quality control. I feel that Canon's support leaves a lot to be desired. If they were not willing to send a repair technician like LG did with a defective TV that I purchased then they should at least offer to have UPS pick up and return their defective products.;;1.0;;February 11, 2012;;14;;22;;0.636364

However, the printer has two major disadvantages when compared to its major competitor (Brother HL2270DW) and also a major software flaw.<br /><br />(1) The output for each toner cartridge is nearly 50% less than its main competitor, Brother Printer HL2270DW. The HP's approx output is 1600 vs. 2600 for Brother. But yet the HP toners are more expensive. I initially purchased the Brother printer but was then forced to return it because it was not AirPrint compatible.<br /><br />(2) The Brother model is about twice as fast as the HP. But both output speeds are pretty good.<br /><br />(3) A dumb firmware update which is required in order to have the AirPrint functionality. The firmware update requires about 30 mins of your time and if you can't install it yourself, you would need to contact HP and spend 2 hours over the phone. Also, the best part is that if you ever unplug the device from power outlet, all wireless functions stop operating including AirPrint because the printer resets and thus removes the firmware update. Then you have to uninstall and reinstall everything including firmware. Disappointing.;;1.0;;October 29, 2011;;5;;7;;0.714286

Since my Canon video and still cameras have been such reliable units, I'm hopeful that this printer will reflect the same high quality. That said, I am quite disappointed at the lack of compatibility with my Mac. I'd read that this unit won't scan from the Mac, but since I don't scan very often, and since I have just installed Windows capability within my Mac I figured I could use that route in a pinch. What I hadn't counted on is the website statement for the Lion driver "Limit: Cannot print from some applications, such as Preview/TextEdit.  Workaround: None." OK, up above it says, "The driver version with official OS X Lion support is scheduled to be released between October and November 2011." Well it is late October so maybe this will be resolved in a month or two (or not), but it definitely is sub-optimal to have a unit that won't print from "some applications".<br /><br />After installing the unit software within Windows (within VMWare, within the Mac) scanning seems to work ok, but the process seems typically Windows-complex. The printed manual says ""To scan documents by operating a computer See Scan in the e-Manual." Is there some reason the print manual couldn't also include computer scanning? Then there is a dialog box that asks "select scan type, computer or remote scanner" First of all, what does remote scanner mean? Second, when scanning from my computer, apparently "remote scanner" needs to be selected, not "computer". The settings dialog box is just weird; all it appears to do is allow for renaming the windows computer, adding comments to four buttons, and choosing to "close toolbox after finishing scanning when started from device." I still don't know what that means. My current process is to scan a jpg file onto the Windows desktop, drag the file out of the Windows window onto the Mac desktop and manipulate the file from there.<br /><br />Would I recommend this unit? For Mac users it's a push: the competition seems to have made low reliability MF units and hopefully this Canon will be better. Has Canon done a satisfactory job of supporting Macs? No. For Windows users I guess software like this is par for the course.<br /><br />ADDENDUM AFTER TWO DAYS: IT'S GOING BACK!<br /><br />I spent too much of today figuring how to get this unit to scan from within the Mac. After several false starts and much outside consultation I finally was able to scan from within the Mac using Ethernet and the MFtoolbox software. AND THEN, I noticed the document feeder consistently feeds the pages in at an angle! Great! Maybe Samsung, maybe Brother, but not Canon.;;1.0;;October 24, 2011;;9;;13;;0.692308

A little history - I had an HP.  The rollers for the fax were wearing out and they don't offer replacements.  So, I went to Sam's and bought their KODAK printer (an earlier model of the HERO 6.1).  I had it for 5 days and the electronic display suddenly stopped working.  You couldn't print to the printer at all.  The printer was not recognized.  Well, I returned it and bought this printer on Amazon.  Thought that the latest model might have the kinks ironed out.  No such luck.<br /><br />First off, the printer DOES not stay set up in Wireless mode.  You'd have to shut down the printer and the computer and restart to get it to connect again. My recommendation - if you do buy this printer, use a wired connection.<br /><br />Secondly, I use GoToMyPC for remote connection to my work.  I went through tech support there and with Kodak and could not get this printer to work with the remote printer.  I had no issues with my previous printer (and have since purchased an Epson and don't have a problem now.)<br /><br />Thirdly, this printer also had the electronic display stop working.  You couldn't connect to the printer or even get the power to the printer.<br /><br />In the future, I will never purchase another Kodak printer.;;1.0;;February 24, 2012;;3;;5;;0.6

They sent me someone else's broken returned model that had not been refurbished.<br /><br />So after being stuck with two (2) broken printers I decided to just give up and not get an Epson.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Epson didn't see it this way and kept on insisting that they'd send me a replacement.  After I said I do not want it, I got yelled at by the Epson rep so I asked for a manager.  No manager ever came on.<br /><br />Instead, the woman said that I would have to go out and find a box to repack both printers and take it to fedex to drop off.  If you have looked at this printer, it is not small and I have two (2) that are busted.  So after even more wasted time they agreed to schedule a pick up for me.  I still had to go and pay for large enough boxes and packing supplies at my own expense because they "couldn't send me a box" or "couldn't compensate me for the cost of the box."<br /><br />At the end of the day, I can only dream that this printer is amazing but I never had the opportunity to use it.<br /><br />In short, if you buy an Epson and something is not right, don't count on them for much or any reasonable amount of help.  Just return it and ask for a refund because there is no guarantee that the replacement they offer you will work either.<br /><br />By the way, their tech support is closed on Sundays so good luck if you work on the weekends.;;1.0;;February 13, 2012;;7;;10;;0.7

However, it is billed as Mac compatible - a flat lie.  It comes with no Mac software, and customer support urges you to install it on Windows.  Customer support readily admits it is not a good fit for Snow Leopard, but it won't tell you that on their website.  They urge you to buy third party scanning software to support it, but can't name a software vendor that it works with.  The driver is alpha-ready, if this.  I love computer tinkering, but this is crazy.<br /><br />With the built-in drivers from Apple, you can scan a single page at a time. Period.  Use Acrobat Pro and it will scan 2 pages periodically before locking up the printer.  Except as a printer, it is nonfunctional for all practical purposes with regard to any other feature.<br /><br />The print quality is good on the rare occasion it works.<br /><br />I have always thought highly of Lexmark when I used them with PCs.  However, misrepresenting compatibility leaves me with a several hundred dollar lump of electronic garbage that has wasted time and resources for my business.

To wit: I in fact never printed anything with it.  I attempted a scan, with limited success.  I was able to boot the machine up without too much difficulty, and was able to find it on the wireless network with little trouble.  Shortly afterwards, it gave me a message to download updates.  No problem.  After it rebooted, it gave me a another update message.  While initiating an attempt to download this update, the machine lost the wireless connection.  After that it attempted to update forever.  I was unable to find any way of fixing this doing troubleshooting on my own.  I called HP support and I will say their support was rather helpful, but in about 5-10 minutes they came to the conclusion that my purchase was now a rather large paperweight, not a printer/scanner/anything truly functional.  They sent me a replacement that arrived in a few days.  I purchased the machine roughly 8-9 months after initial release.  I found customer reviews on other websites that described similar problems with similar resolutions.  I rate the machine so low as it appears that no resolution is forthcoming from the company, and I needed the machine to last as long as possible - not for the 3 years I can get covered through an extended warranty!  Rather the replace the machine every so often after a failed update, I just chose to return it and get something completely different.<br /><br />EDIT 2/19/12<br /><br />TO clarify the above: The unit I purchased died about 45min out of the box.  Based on my review of other customer reviews, this appears to be the result of a defect intrinsic to all like units.  I purchased the unit several months after initial release, and several months after other customers had posted regarding this issue.  HP's customer service was excellent, insofar as they shipped a replacement after one of their reps had done trouble-shooting with me over the phone and declared it deceased.  However, this was not adequate for my purposes as the defect appears to be present in all units, the defect (if it occurs) destroys the unit, and the only redress available several months after product release is to replace the unit under warranty.  Once the warranty runs out (I had a 2 year extension) then you must purchase a completely new unit.  For me, that was a deal breaker.  I felt that a different solution should be available this far after release.  So HP either cannot or will not correct this defect.;;1.0;;January 5, 2012;;6;;12;;0.5

It took 3 calls to HP support to get credited for the $10, at least returning the printer to Amazon was easy. One HP support person even tried to argue with me that the "1020 Series" title used on the CD driver page didn't actually refer to the 1020 itself! Finally, the 3rd support person stated that their page had a typo and credited me back for the $10.<br /><br />I've since replaced the hp 1020 with a brother HL-2070N.

Also on the good side is the price I paid .. it only cost me $229 including shipping - and with a rebate I got that down to $189 - so it was cheap to buy.  On the Bad side:  the quality of the prints on both regular bond and glossy paper is terrible.  Forget using this printer for native printing of photos taken by a high quality camera - even at the highest dpi settings, the prints come out dark and somewhat undifferentiated. I'll use Photoshop to try and compensate for the poor print quality.  On the ugly side, this is one big heavy sucker!  And when its running and even prior to going into sleep mode; it draws so much power it causes my nearby UPS/power conditioner to cycle endlessly until the printer goes into sleep mode.  You would think the prints would be far better given the enoormous weight and footprint of this thing - but nope ... big and fat and crummy prints too.  Finally, on the cheap side ... while I have a few of these on the shelf and you really don't need it to set up wireless printing; if you follow the OEM instructions, Brother tells you to hook up a USB/IEEE cable they don't provide in the box!  So, for about $2.00 they save; that will drive the average buyer nuts - but not to worry it is a stardard printer USB cable and you can probably snag it from one of your other printers or from a friendly neighbor.  In conclusion; Would I buy this printer again? - the answer is "no," ... I'd pay more attention to the on-line reviews about its lack of print quality and not be such a cheapskate and get a better printer ... after all, if you are buying a color laser printer you ought to expect far better quality than this printer can deliver.;;2.0;;March 3, 2012;;19;;31;;0.612903

I tried Hammerhill and Kodak photo papers with grainy results and ink still wet.<br /><br />I called Epson after trying all the information off the Epson site to correct the problem. I get to speak to Dominic, Andreas, and Ken - no one located on this continent. The entire (1 hour +) brought no resolution and comments that they only guarantee results when you use Epson papers. I told them that if I had known that I could only use Epson photo paper I wouldn't have purchased the printer. They tell me that I can use whatever paper I like, but they test their inks on Epson paper and that their paper would give the best results. They can phrase this whatever way they'd like, but it means that pictures will only come out correctly with thier paper.<br /><br />The customer service from Epson rates a 1 star, and this has been a hard lesson to learn. Buy the cheapest printer with the functions you need - if you spend $90 or $900 the customer service is the same - awful. They have lost a customer.;;2.0;;May 25, 2011;;9;;15;;0.6

I printed 75 full color pages and ran of out ink. I understand I used a lot of ink but still thought this was far from 750 pages. Unhappy about the shortage I went to Office Depot and bought the 4 replacements cartridges, which cost more than the printer itself.  I then printed 150 more full color pages and ran out again. I called HP and went all the way to the top case worker. It took me 45 minutes on the phone for them to tell me that I used too much ink. I explained that I had printed 150 full color front and back pages which should total 300 pages.  The estimated copies I should have got out of the initial cartridges plus the replacement cartridges was suppose to be 3,750 which is a difference of 2,750 pages. I find this as a complete money maker on the part of HP and very misleading.  They said they could not help me and refused to reimburse or replace the brand new cartridges.

And the fax set-up is just weird, but maybe if I'd spent more time on that it wouldn't have kept answering my phone unexpectedly.<br /><br />But what disappointed me the most is how lousy the wireless Mac network experience is.  My set-up is nothing bizarre: I have an AirPort Extreme Base station, and for years have plugged my (aging) Brother multi-function printer into it and printed with abandon.  But after unsuccessfully trying to print over-the-air to this Canon, and then downloading the (gigantic) printer driver and the (almost as gigantic) scan driver, I discovered two things: Bonjour printing is "not supported" except using printer sharing, and scanning is "not supported" under any circumstances using WiFi.  By the way, the only way to discover this is to contact Customer Support: the manual gives instructions for "Bonjour" printing, but apparently they're only referring to computer-to-computer printer sharing.)<br /><br />I should have done a bit more research on this printer beforehand.  In my defense, I was led astray by the fact that this is a modern printer and sports a little Mac icon on the Canon website, including listing "OS X Compatible" under Specifications.

But then....hooked up the phone line to the fax input, the input jack isn't working right, I have to jiggle the phone cord to get a dial tone, and yes I tried different cords. I then contact Samsung Customer Supper via Twitter and pretty much I get the run around, and they can't find the serial number to the printer in their system so I have to take pictures of them and my receipt and I'm still waiting for them to see what theyre going to do and it's been 4 days now and they tell me they'll get back to me. But WAIT THERE'S MORE! Now the printing is now faded with any color and black. And I can't get it corrected with any setting or reset. My past two Samsung purchases have been horrible and that's what I always buy. My dryer is crap and so is this printer. Their customer service is a joke, they assume I should just send back this huge printer that's as heavy and big as a small car I'm guessing. This thing is worse than the HP laser I had previous and that's pretty sad. I can't be a loyal Samsung buyer anymore with the horrible customer service they have.;;1.0;;August 15, 2012;;3;;10;;0.3

The store named Best Buy claims to have a 30 return policy. I bought an HP printer from the so-called Best Buy store and I soon ran out of ink.  I also had a terrible time with the HP printer.  The HP printer had very little ink, it took forever too get the printer to start, it made a lot of noise when compared to other Brand named printers, it took a long time to print let alone shut down and it printed a test page that used up a great amount of INK without me directing it to.  The HP printer also has very little INK that comes with the HP printer and when I purchased extra regular INK cartridges I ran out very soon. I found this out with HP printers; very little INK.  If you buy a regular HP ink cartridge you are buying what I call a sample HP INK cartridge since it runs out of ink quickly.  If you think about it the HP cartridges that show 2.5 times more INK are the same size as the regular cartridges.  You then have to ask, "how much ink do they really put in the regular OVER priced HP INK cartridges"?  I considered myself cheated when I bought the regular sized cartridge.  My personal opinion is that the HP 2.5 times more INK cartridges run out after printing only about 50% more than the regular overpriced HP INK cartridges while you end up paying a lot more.<br />The only good thing about my experience with the Best Buy store is that I was able to try out the HP INK supply and the printers' performance!  I could suggest doing the same but I won't.  I will state that I wasn't shy returning the HP printer to the Best Buy store because I was not afraid of this chain store and I was not satisfied with the performance of the HP Printer.  Best Buy says you have 30 days to return the HP Printer you should have 30 days but this is a misnomer!  I tried the HP printer I bought from the Best Buy store and I didn't like its performance.  The Best Buy store states that you can return it within 30 days for a full refund if you don't like its performance.  I took the Best Buy store for their word and I returned the HP printer to the Best Buy store after 25 days of use.  The Best Buy store would not take the return without me signing a statement stating that I would not return anything I buy until after a 90-day period from the time I returned the HP Printer.  I should have told them to F off and accept my return without signing their statement.  The Best Buy store also wants a photo ID from everyone when they return something.  If the item is being charged back to your credit card then you should not have too give them any ID!  This amounts too invasion of privacy (Big Brother).  AMAZON IS THE BEST BUY!  AMAZON DOES NOT ASK FOR A PHOTO ID!<br />My opinion is that the Best Buy store is not the BEST BUY! I believe Amazon is the BEST BUY!<br />MY OPINION IS THAT Amazon does have the BEST BUY.  Amazon is not like the so-called Best Buy store.  It is my opinion that Amazon ALWAYS gives you the BEST BUY.  I will stay committed to Amazon and quit buying from the so-called Best Buy store.  Amazon has fantastic delivery, great service, in most states no tax, in most cases free shipping, extended warranties are available and Amazon will take care of any problems immediately, unlike the so-called Best Buy store!;;1.0;;August 12, 2012;;1;;10;;0.1

Tougher than cheap steak!;;I love Canon, but NOT this printer on a Mac! The scanning process is convoluted and tedious, hard to figure out. Yes, you can get it to work, but it takes a lot of fiddling. The main complaint is that you cannot just access the scan function from the computer, you need to go to the printer and press hard buttons to get it ready to scan, every time. And the feeder is only simplex, although the printer is billed as duplex. The reference to duplex is for printing only. To be fair, the print and copy functions are very nice (albeit expensive, as another poster noted.) The MF Toolbox software supplied is archaic, old fashioned software. I run Windows (Parallels) on my Mac, but the Windows version of MF Toolbox is similar, and after working for a while, it stopped and does not recognize the scanner. And finally, Ethernet is not supported for Mac scanning, so you need to hook it up USB. Ill-conceived interface and processes by Canon. I had to rate this low because the main reason I bought it was for scanning!;;1.0;;December 12, 2011;;5;;7;;0.714286

It will print one page, then jam.  So you have to take out the paper tray and re-arrange the paper, then put it back in and let one more page print.  This process goes on again and again--print, jam, print, jam, print, jam.  The printer cartridges are expensive too, because the machine requires four or five separate cartridges, which cost a total of $70.  I used to own an HP printer, but it was non-wireless.  Now that the wireless HPs are comparable in price to this one, I think I'll get rid of this machine and buy something more reliable.  The set-up was easy, as all of the reviews said it was, and once the machine finally prints your document (it is veeeeeery slow), the print-out looks good.

I wanted to buy this Epson 835 printer from them along with two other products totaling about $440.00. I emailed their Executive Customer Relations Department to politely let them know that one could buy this printer directly from Epson for $199.99 (Valid from 9/19/10 through 10/2/10) with FREE SHIPPING and nicely asked them that if they could just come close to the $199.99 price I would buy it from them (as of yesterday Amazon's price was $299.99 which is list price) along with the two other products. Amazon sent me a rather terse and arrogant reply basically telling me to "buzz off" and if I did not like their prices to buy it somewhere else (which I did today... from Epson direct for $199.99 with free shipping). Amazon usually has pretty good prices, but not for this product at this time. I also must say that the people that work in their Executive Customer Relations Department could learn some manners. I am not particularly thin-skinned but their reply to me was quite rude and that is why I am writing this review. BTW... the only difference between the 835 and the 810 is that the 835 is "g/n" wireless capable, where the 810 is only "g." So if you don't need or want "n" you can go with the 810.;;5.0;;September 22, 2010;;42;;71;;0.591549

I ordered one in December.<br /><br />It was amazingly easy to set up.  For the first fews weeks I was happy with it, despite its lack of a document feeder.  Then I had a software problem, which took several hours to correct and included a lengthy phone call with my friends at an off-shore customer support center.<br /><br />Still I was happy with my new printer for a few more weeks, until I had another software problem.  Ditto the paragraph above.<br /><br />Then two weeks ago, just as I was finishing invoices and statements for my small business, print quality went through the floor.  I went on line.  They said I needed a new printhead, which they shipped (they are not sold by local retailers).  It took 11 days to get here.  Why it takes 11 days to ship something from Ohio to Seattle, I don't know.<br /><br />The printhead came with a page directing me to the Kodak web site for installation instructions.  I am staring at a menu of several hundred options, none of which include the words "printhead" or "ESP 7250."  Looks like another call off shore is indicated.<br /><br />Or, maybe HP's isn't so expensive afterall.;;1.0;;August 10, 2011;;8;;30;;0.266667

The sales person informed me that for an extra $50 we could also get the HP B210 printer. That sounded like a good enough deal at the time so we went for it. My daughter lives 300 miles away so we dropped it off at her apartment before Christmas. Since then, my daughter has made a few dozen prints with this machine with great difficulty. Each time she prints, she must remove and re-install the printer software. In one case the document she was trying to print came out a week later??? HP online support was not helpful in solving her problem. When she finally informed me of the problems she was having, I checked out the Amazon customer reviews. It is now clear to me that this is a flawed and failed product line from HP. Due to the logistics of getting the printer back from 300 miles away, I decided not to worry about taking it back to Apple (I don't want another one anyway). I just told my daughter to go out and get an EPSON and she can send the HP to the nearest landfill - something it is much more suited for. I used to be a loyal HP customer. I'll never buy another. Too bad Apple will also have their reputation tarnished by association with this company. I will definitely not purchase any Apple products bundled with an HP printer again unless I can get them to substitute something else for the printer.;;1.0;;February 27, 2011;;3;;5;;0.6

But I want to warn prospective buyers who plan on using the printer in a Mac environment about one glaring problem with fax functionality: don't expect to be able to use this printer to fax anything without physically printing it out on paper first. (Note that this shortcoming does not seem to apply to users on the Windows side of the aisle)<br /><br />If, for example, you're planning on sending a 30 page fax you can't just "print to fax" the way you can with some other multi-function machines (like the HP 8500 I used to have) and have the document faxed directly -- you have to do it old school and print everything out on paper first and then fax the stack of paper. This is an outrageous and unnecessary waste of paper, ink and, most importantly, time if you send any volume of faxes. According to (the very vague and unhelpful) Canon tech I spoke to there "may be a way" to support this functionality but it requires "additional hardware" and a necessity to talk to Apple about it. In other words, they pass the buck and are very dismissive about it. They said there are no plans to implement the functionality in the future.<br /><br />Also, if you intend on receiving faxes directly to your computer -- again bypassing the unnecessary waste of paper and ink and saving you the time and trouble of having to scan a poor quality fax into your computer to file it digitally -- you are similarly out of luck. Other multi-function machines offer this capability (although it's sometimes well hidden -- printer makers want you to use up the expendables whenever possible) but at least it's an option. With this printer? Not so much. And this time the deficiency is on both the Mac and Windows side.;;1.0;;August 8, 2011;;20;;30;;0.666667

Do not insert your Epson product CD.  Go to the Epson support site for special instructions".  So they knew the CD didn't work yet shipped it anyway?  Not impressed so far.  Went to Epson's website, followed their instructions, downloaded the new driver, ran the Epson installation wizard, ran an Apple software update, and....no wireless communication.  Uninstalled the Epson drivers to get a fresh start and did it again. No luck.  Uninstalled again and tried using only the Apple update with the printer hooked up via USB (i.e. nothing from the Epson website).  Apple update again provided something that referenced Epson printer software, but the driver installation was incomplete as now it wouldn't even communicate via the USB port.  Spent a couple frustrating hours searching web forums for a solution as Epson online support documentation was vague and no help.  No luck.<br /><br />Finally stumbled upon a solution purely by luck.  Here's what I did:<br />1) Uninstalled everything to start fresh<br />2) Downloaded Epson's driver combo package, BUT DID NOT RUN EPSON INSTALL YET<br />3) Ran Apple Update, which found updates for Epson printers and installed them<br />4) Continued with the Epson Install process<br /><br />Bingo.

Red and Green ink. They simply are not used.<br /><br />Try printing a pure Green or Red section. 100C + 100Y, or 100M +100Y... and what? Zero Green or Red ink expended...<br /><br />Try converting to RGB space, and put down 255R or 255G... same result... Canon squirts copius amounts of C,M and especially Y down, and while the Red & Green inks sleep, they collect ink cartridge fees to finance the Pixma Pyramid scheme. For heaven's sake, even the Photo Cyan and Photo Magenta are guzzled at a rate 100 times the Red and Green ink meters nudge down...<br /><br />Canon's explanation is that the Green and Red inks "extend" the color gamut of photo images... slightly... only under certain conditions... and certain paper types... and certain paper sizes... sometimes. Right. They even claim that their Red and Green inks are NOT represented by any known combination of CMY inks, or an RGB value. Wow. Green is not Green. Red is not Red.<br /><br />Too bad for you (as far as they are concerned) if you decide NOT to be blind stupid happy campers and refuse to drink the Canon Koolaid... Red and Green Koolaid...<br /><br />In reality, you will expend 40+ cartridges of the 4 color process inks, for every Red or Green cartridge expended.<br /><br />Can it be overriden? No.<br /><br />Do alternate drivers or color profile settings exist that tweak it out? No.<br /><br />Do you consume enormous amounts of CM&Y ink carts making process reds and greens? You betcha.<br /><br />So why, for crying out loud, are Red & Green inks marketed?<br /><br />To minimize ink saturation on heavy R/G color sections?<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />To save enormous amounts of print head firing, by laying down 2 picoliters of R instead of 2 picoliters of M plus 2 picoliters of Y to make a RED dot on the paper?<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />You figure it out. Canon has their (our) cake and they eat it too... pay them extra for an 8 color printer, and STILL buy their ink by the bucketload.<br /><br />What a business plan. Do they hear the Voice of the Customer? No way.;;1.0;;July 5, 2010;;15;;22;;0.681818

However, in OS9 it didn't work at all with AppleTalk (via Chooser), but when connected via AppleTalk LPR (using the Desktop Printer Utility) it went nuts trying to print from Quark Xpress 4.11 (one of my main programs). It would endlessly print a few lines of postscript code on each page from its tray until it was exhausted (then showed an out of paper error to continue its endless printing). Only programs like MS Word would print correctly in the OS9 environment via LPR. In OSX it worked fine using Rendezvous. Then on the sixth day of ownership its network card decided to stop all communication with Rendezvous and even IP printing. I tried re-checking all parameters and settings and finally did resets. No print jobs would complete all the way through pausing at 92% data transferred with nothing printed. This was ridiculous for a company like Hewlett Packard which long has had an excellent reputation in my mind, especially in the Mac graphics world. The 1320N has ended my favorable opinion of HPs since their model lines above the 1320 weren't competitive with other brands. Also, I've been noticing several 1320's (3 total) both regular and N models on display at retail stores showing unrecoverable print errors with their blinking orange LED in the middle of its array. Short of turning it off and on, press any button or open the front toner loader panel and it will still not recover. BTW, they had paper in their paper trays.;;1.0;;May 23, 2005;;9;;22;;0.409091

She's not tech savvy at all so I ended up buying her a different brand (Brother) and keeping this one for myself. Good thing it was only $50 and not the asking price it's going for now. I set this printer up with my mac and my goodness what a pain in the a@@.  I have never been inspired to write a review for a product good or bad before. First off it took quite longer than it should to set up the network feature then within about 30 minutes of being set up, I kept getting an error message that says scanner cannot not be recognized. Before the scanner quit working altogether it really was very noisy - UNBELIEVABLE Canon!!! Just unbelievable and the printing was so sloooww. Good grief!  The only good thing I can say about this product is that printing is relatively quiet, but scanning (while it worked) is very loud and grating. I didn't bother to try copying since I was trying to figure how to get that horrible scanning noise to stop - and btw, that quiet mode setting on the printer, DOES NOT WORK!  The absolute worst thing however was the uninstall. Canon saw fit to put files all over my mac and it took about 50 minutes to find them all - because not every file that was installed was called "canon".  Stay away from this product. I'm going to try to find a way to get rid of this thing and I'll most likely get the Brother printer - that was a breeze to install and function and - it has a fax!

The printer itself is basically fine. I have a new netbook and I wanted something wireless and a bit faster and newer than my HP 5510. I have always had a good experience with HP printers, until this machine came into my life. The software did not install correctly the first time, but that's OK, I uninstalled, rebooted, reinstalled, rebooted, plugged and unplugged things until it installed OK and my computer recognized that I have a brand-new printer. But it wouldn't recognize that I have a scanner. When I press the button to scan, it tells me "no scan options" and I can't scan through the HP Solution Center, because there is no such option, though there is a happy little scanner area with a picture of a scanner. I went through the tech support rigmarole, and even after a registry change, my printer wouldn't scan. I didn't have another hour to kill on this so the next day I just scoured the internet with as specific set of queries as I could put together, and found a helpful tidbit. Turns out that you can go through good old Paint, in Start>>All Programs>>Accessories>>Paint>>File>>From Scanner or Camera, and your scanner will scan for you! So the scanner works! Everything works, it's just the shoddy software. Since I can't scan through the HP software, I can't seem to align my cartridges, and in general, scanning through Paint it very limiting and not really a solution when one can simply return the beast.

To start off the printer is advertized with E-Print and AirPrint capabilities.  These are not active out of the box.  After some short research I found that you must complete a firmware upgrade to use these functions.  This sounds simple enough but instructions are horrible.  About mid way through the firmware upgrade (over wireless) the printer looses wireless connection.  I would recommend trying the update over USB maybe you will have a better outcome. Because of the loss of connection your computer assumes the firmware upgrade never completed.  This is my experience maybe others had a different experience.  During the update the printer assumes a different IP address.  Not wanting to change the IP of the router and my laptop I figured I would just delete the printer from Printers and reset the printer to factory settings.  This seems like a good idea but the printer does not start its auto configuration when you plug it in for the second time.  After time consuming research I found that the printer needs to be deleted form add remove programs and then you can run the install and set up the printer again.  Then next problem appears when you turn the power off on the printer the wireless never reconnects.  After more extensive research I found that the only way to get the printer back is to power cycle the router after the printer is power cycled.  The printer wireless light is always solid blue but it will not communicate unless you power cycle the router.  This appears to be a glitch in the software update.  Just figured I would let you all know and maybe save you some time trouble shooting.;;1.0;;January 29, 2012;;5;;8;;0.625

I did not see anything on the box or label that sound "Does not print color" and I think it should say more than just "monochrome" which I had no idea meant it only prints in black.  However all things considered this is a good printer.  It is true that after printing it makes a bit of noise for about 15 minutes before it goes back to sleep.

Don't bother.;;Paper handling has been an issue for printers, copiers since the beginning of time and this printer is no exception.  25 pagers per minute, duplex printing!  Great, only problem is none of that means a thing if you are using gloss paper, and I'm not talking card stock here.  If you try printing on gloss paper a little prompt comes up that tells you to use the manual feed for gloss paper.  You've got to be freaking kidding.  That's why you buy a color printer. Any high volume job of a few hundred double sided brochures has now become a 10 hour long road to hell.  I tried to go ahead and load the gloss paper into the tray when it was just turned on and it works ok, for about 80 copies, then the static builds to the point where it pulls thru 2 and 3 pages at a time.  Matte paper is only somewhat better but don't expect to bump the copy count to 100 duplex printing, go get a pizza and come back to completed print job.  Forget it. Boasts of high ppm, duplex printing are worthless if they don't work except on plain white paper. Engineers need to forget about all the bells and whistles and figure out simple bomb proof paper handling.  I bought this printer because the standard printing job was going to cost 400.00.  I decided to buy the printer as would pay for itself with a 1/2 dozen brochure runs.  I will never be able to recoupe the hours lost however and I regret my decision;;1.0;;August 26, 2011;;9;;15;;0.6

I've tried adjusting and changing the settings, even when printing a PHOTO the highest quality print you can do with this printer it comes out very pixelated and blurry, not all the details are there no matter how many changes you make. I am a design professional and have adjusted my images and text in many different programs for a clearer image but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I would not recommend this printer to anyone.

My needs were very specific and and I found the printer that matches them perfectly.<br /><br />What features of this printer are important to me:<br /><br />* Easy and fast set up - I am not big time computer wiz but I can definitely follow easy and quick set up instructions. It took me about 20 minutes from the moment I have brought the box upstairs to the home office to the time I had first printed page in my hands. The instructions are very easy to folow and they are very straighth forward. No confusing commands, no usless and unnecessary steps.<br />I would say, my third grader indeed could read and follow them.<br /><br />* Wireless function. I am done with cables. I want my printer to be portable in a sens that I can just unplug it and plug it wherever I  please and not to worry if it is close enough to my computer so the cable is long enough. It is not only about my precious desk space but also about the option of having it connected it in totally different room altogether if I choose so all of us can send our printing job to it from all rooms in the house with one easy accessible for all place to pick it up. In our case this is the upstairs hallway. Of course whenever I feel more possesive I can just take the printer and plug it in the wall next to me and have it within my hand reach. No extra steps required.. no set ups just plug and print.. and move it somwhre ese.. plug and print some more. That easy! Of course if you need to use it via USB cable then it most certainly does oblige. I did try for a kick and it did work with USB just fine.<br /><br />* Three separate color ink cartriges and one black cartrige. - why is it imprtant to me? Because<br />I like to replace just one clor, the one that is actually out as opposed to printers equipped with just two cartrages: one - all in one color cartrage and one black. It is painful to have to throw out all color cartrige just because let's say.. you had to pring 200 pink ink flyers and you ren out of your magenta ink.. but now yor printer won't print because your color cartrige has to be replaced.<br />This won't happen whith this 6500 model. If you ren out of pink you buy new pink, if yellow is what you need.. you just buy yellow.. the same with black... Simply printer will tell you which cartrige you need to buy and that is that.  That is a money saving feature not to mention convenience and environment concerns.<br /><br />* Size of ink cartriges - size of the cartriges is wonderful. It is not your tinny itsy bitsy one week worth of ink load. You can print seemingly without end with this printer.<br /><br />* Cost of ink - I think it is silly to rely on other people's numbers regarding per page cost because what if I will be priinting all page pictures and you will be printing few lines per page?<br />How do we compare the average cost per page? Even one the same person does change printing needs from job to job so it is hard to specify. However from my experience the ink cartriges do last for a VERY long time so for me this translates into low cost of per page printing. For manufacturer's reference however if you want to get EXACT INK Cost as provided by HP please enjoy the page that I hafe found for you.. just divide price of cartrige per estimated pages and you got your average..<br /><br />INK CARTRIGES Cost and efficiency FOR 6500 A Plus Wireless:<br /><br />http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/supplies_model.do?model_name=HP%20Officejet%206500A%20Plus%20e%2DAll%2Din%2DOne%20Printer<br /><br />* Speed of printing - this was imortant however secondary to the cost of ink and ease of use.<br />This printer is like a typhoon! By my standards it is perfect. I don't like to wait unitll my page prints out forever so now I don't. It is perfect.<br /><br />For documents the manufacturer's specs list:  up to 32 ppm* in black, up to 31 ppm* in color.<br />That is pretty much what I suppose it is. I never actually timed it but for simpple black and white text page it is definitely that it takes half a second for one page for black and white.. just as they pretty much list.. 32 ppm.. means 32 pages per minute.. so minute has 60 second.. lets divide the two.. 60 by 32.. here where I got my half second per page from.. rounded up.<br /><br />as to printing photo here is what the manufacturer suggests:<br />4" x 6" photo-quality print in as little as 17 seconds.*<br />I would say this is pretty acurate again. I did not time it per se but I would say that is within acceptable norm.<br /><br />* All in one function - I can envision nowdays to have separate fax, separate printer and separate scanner and copier. It would just be impractical space-wise, since this machine does all for about 150.00 USD. I find it highly convenient and since all functions works just perfect, then why not.<br />- printer works great as described.<br />- scanner works great, software is easy to follow and documents looks great once scanned. It is high quality scanner.<br />- Copier is just as easy to use, and gives you both color and black and white copies in a blink.<br />- fax - easy, fast and simple<br />- oh did I say that it prints directly from the web? yes it does. Not that I need  to at this time in my life but my kids do and they use this feature and however I did not use it first hand I hear now and then "aaaaaawsome" as they pick the printed page from the printer after using web feature.<br /><br />* Desk space saver - as discussed above - very important for me. On one hand it is big printer but then again.. first size up that gives you those separate ink cartrages that you might want if you need to save ( lower HP printer models aka HP 4500.. won't have separate color cartriges). of cours you can go with lower model that will be just as good.. aside from being smaller in size it will not give you separate color inks! but will be just as good.. oh that and it will be printing bit slower per page.. some 22ppm for black if I recall seeing in the store.<br />So the wireless function allowing you to have it set up AnY:WHERE in the house is what I love. NO more being slave of the cable lenght.<br /><br />* Top loader for copying. - yes this is important for me. Did you ever have to copy some 20 pages at one time and did you get fed up with having to stand and load one page at the time on the flat bed scanner to have the document to be copied? I did. now I don't have to. I simply put the pile of paper work to be  copied on the top loader and go downstairs to relax and get a snack. I came back, the copying is all done.<br />Just like in a big copy shop... you put it in the loader and press copy button and that is all to it.<br /><br />Physical size of the printer: important to those of you who either do not care about wireless feature, nor do not want to use it for other reasons and need to use their USBcable connector -<br />it is important that you consider desk space for this printer. It is relatively big I would say...<br />it is raughly 16 by 10 by 18 inches size-wise.<br /><br />What else the printer has or can do:<br /><br />* comes with one year warranty. okay, that is good. I bought it with my credit card and it that double that! so I have two years. PS. most credit cards do double warranties so do check with yours.<br /><br />*black printer resolution is 800dpi.. which means dots per inch.. which is good. really good.<br />while color printing is set at 4800 X 1200 dpi (dots per inch) and this is what you need for photo printing to look good. lots of dots per inch :)<br /><br />* what it will print on: Plain paper, photo paper, envelopes, transparencies<br /><br />* what will fit in this printer: Letter, legal, statement, executive, 3" x 5", 4" x 6", 5" x 7", 5" x 8", 4" x 10", 4" x 11", 4" x 12", 8" x 10", envelopes (#10, monarch, DL)<br /><br />* how many of those will fit in the printer loader: Up to 250 sheets letter/legal, up to 50 sheets transparencies, up to 80 sheets photo paper, up to 80 sheets 4" x 6" photos, up to 30 envelopes, up to 80 cards<br /><br />* and how often will  you have to take the printed material out? once the output drawer will fill up and when is it? as follows: Up to 50 sheets legal/letter, up to 25 sheets transparencies, up to 25 cards, up to 15 envelopes<br /><br />* it has 64 MB memory.. important for processing and storing documents for printing etc..<br /><br />* for those who need to connect it via USB: it has 2.0 USB type of connection<br /><br />* it comes with all ink cartriges along with the printer in the box.<br /><br />* it comes with PC free printing - translation: you don't need computer to print things, you can print from other sources<br /><br />* it will support your double sided printing and it does it automatically. You don't have to do it manually feeding one page at the time and wait for both sides to print like it used to be.<br /><br />* networking capabilities: Ethernet,  - for those who need to know  :)<br /><br />* scanner resolution 4800 dpi.<br /><br />*scanner type -flat bed<br /><br />* how many pages can you put into the loader of the printer? - they specify 100 at the time can be loaded in the loader for copying and they will be taken one by one.. copied and output in the front.. and next one and next and so on..<br /><br />* Fax memory - 100 pages..<br /><br />* if you need to reduce or enlarge document it will allow you to reduce your original page to size it to 25% of the original or up to 400% enlarge in one step. Of course if you  need to reduce or resize parts even more.. just repeat the step and you will double enlarge reduce or whatever the final size..<br /><br />* comes with two media slots for your camera memory cards. Awsome! you can just stick it in and either print from them directly skiping computer or you can use the slots to transfer photos from your camera into the computer so it acts as a reader for  your medias. So it is trully All in one printer!<br /><br />What's comes in the box:<br />*The Printer<br />*Cartriges: HP 920 black ink cartridge, HP 920 cyan, magenta and yellow ink cartridges<br />*Cords: Power adapter, power cord<br />*Software: Software CD-ROM,<br />Connection for fax: phone cord<br />*Owner's manual<br /><br />For fax to work you need to connect the printer to the phone jack.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />This is great home office printer. Keep in mind that there are basically two lines of HP printers..<br />those that are PHOTO Quality always having PHOTO in their names.. and those who are geared towards<br />those who do not print that much photos at home and take their  photo printing needs elswere for highest quality photo printing yet they need to print mostly paper documents with occassinal photo jobs for their needs.<br /><br />From my experience and in my opinion you can't have both.. and you should take a good look at your printing and cost needs and decide what is good for you.<br /><br />It is easy, if you mainly print documents and a lot of them go with OfficeJet printers as they are much more cost effective and much much faster then photo ptinters for this kind of jobs. Now if you use them for photos they won't give you as great picture quality but they do come close.<br /><br />However if you do need to print pictures all the time and occassionally do print a document then go with Photo printer.. this will give you better and more consistent photo quality printing but those printers are way slower overall for printing and the ink usage tends to be much less economical.<br /><br />Before you buy any printer do check HP how much cost the ink replacement cartriges and how much copies you can print out of one on avearage and this will give you idea if thsi is what you want and need.<br /><br />In our case we mainly print tons of paper in our home and we can get really nice pictures for our home album from it, but for wall frames we send our pictures to some site like Kodagallery or alikes<br />and they ship t hem back home. There are tons of sites that will do it for you jus as good, this was just an example.<br /><br />Lastly if you opted for the Office Jet and trying to decide between HP 4500 HP 6500 and HP 8500<br />here is what I can say after my own research and comarisons:<br /><br />4500 is the smallest of the three.. takes minimal desk space and does superb job in terms of printing<br />speed and print quality, some people complained that it shoots pages on the floor after printing but they don't know how to simply find and extend the paper catcher within the catching drawer.. yes it is there.. just need to look for it. it is folded and in.. so you need to pull it out and open...<br /><br />what is not so great about it: it does not come with separate color ink cartriges just one for color and one for black.<br />what is great about it: price, size and quality, cost per page, regardless of just two inks the cost is minimal, also you can use XL black cartrige and you can't change it for HUNDREDTS of pages!.. I think it was something like 700 or so.. what a convenience! it is also wireless printer.<br /><br />btw.. some people complaint for jams of paper in it.. I did try it and it prints fine.. and beware.. any printer will jam paper if it is not fresh from the batch and wrinkle free. Never used tired and<br />even bitsy wrinkled paper to lad to your printer. That comes after my many years of work at print shop.. the easiest and sure shot way to avoid any jams of paper - use perfect flat and unhandled paper.<br /><br />HP 6500 -<br />what is so great about it: it is wireless but you can also plug it via usb, it has separate color ink cartriges for each color and one for black (and yeah.. black is not a color :)<br />cartriges last seemingly endless, cost per page, durability, speed, very very fast printer,<br />great for document printing. comes with fax, copier, scanner and web printing..<br />comes with media reader slots for your camera memory cards.<br /><br />what is not so great - nothing really, very good printer overall however it is big so if size is what you care about then it is about half size bigger then H P<br /><br />HP 8500 - This is a beast! think of it as bigger and faster HP 6500.. It is much bigger physically as a unit and it prints faster and does other jobs faster. However it might be great for someone who has a small home business it seem to be an overkill for a regular family needs.<br /><br />Whichever printer you will go with do always checck the return policy that you don't need untill things do go wrong and s ometimes they can..  and do try it and see how you like it and test it well before commiting. Once the return window closes you will have to love it for a very long time so do check return policies. Amazon is amazing as far as customer service and policies so I strongly recommend buying it here however I am sure there are other options for purchase. Just make sure they have return policy to suit your needs.<br /><br />Good luck and happy printing.;;5.0;;August 17, 2011;;4;;6;;0.666667

We do very little printing and certainly cannot afford the $0.62/pg that the copy shops are charging.<br /><br />Opening the box... Disappointed with how flimsy the unit feels. Yes, I know it's on the less expensive end of color laser printers, but I was hoping it would be sturdier than your standard "free" inkjet. It doesn't. The paper tray, manual feed and cartridge drawer feel so light they could break if you looked at them wrong.<br /><br />In use... Very noisy, but very fast. Print quality is dark, but I think that can be adjusted through the HP ToolboxFX program that comes with a full driver install (cannot customize install or you don't get this software). Still have to tinker with it to achieve the results I want. Duplex option is terrific and a real time saver. Strangely powers itself on randomly throughout the night even when not in use. Also runs through about 30sec of "clunking" or "knocking" after it completes a print job. Sounds broken.<br /><br />Toner... My #1 complaint - holy cow these things are expensive! Looking at about $500 for a complete set. And in what I think was very limited use, have already replaced each one (bought the machine in Nov). That has covered me for approx 1000 prints at about 30% coverage. That's about on par with the local copy shops for expense.<br /><br />My suggestion is to spend the extra $300 for the professional grade printer so you don't waste all your money on cartridges. Plus, my experience is that the professional stuff isn't nearly as flimsy. I like the print quality and the speed, but ultimately the cost has tainted my opinion of the machine.;;2.0;;February 23, 2011;;5;;7;;0.714286

The copier and scanner both have a feeder but the manual feed was an apparent afterthought built into the side of the printer. There is no option for multiple pages to be fed in the manual feed slot, which is needed. Very slow and tedious. Poor design. Pretty much of a waste overall unless you enjoy constantly switching paper types in the single tray.<br /><br />OK. Heres the full review. It prints & it copies.....like it should. Dont know about the faxing, I email attached PDF documents. Everyone buys a printer for their individual needs.  Im an end user, not a product reviewer and I had certain needs of the printer. Most every printer on the market allows at least 1 primary tray plus a manual feed/drop down tray. The last thing I thought I was going to see was a slot where you hold 1 piece of paper at the opening until the printer grabs it. If you happen to be printing 5 or 10 sheets manually, your sitting there forever feeding one page at a time, waiting for the printer to grab it unless you want to keep changing the primary tray.

Basic install is easy but when it comes to using the printer or after rebooting, you will get a bunch of nagging popups that will tell you that the setup cannot find hpproductassistant.msi.  I found this routine on the setup CD and entered the info into the box.  Nope.  The setup routine tells me that the one on the CD is an "invalid" copy.  "Invalid"? It came on the CD from HP.  How can it be invalid? After repeatedly hitting the Cancel button, the system stops sending that popup.  Then, it starts a popup called Market Research.  Why is HP researching what I am copying?  It is none of their business.  You will go through the same series of clicking on the Cancel button.  Eventually, the setup gives up.  But, and it is a big but, the Market Research window comes up every time you send something to the device to print.<br /><br />I know I am not the only user plagued by this problem.  Go to the internet and enter "hpproductassistant.msi".  You will read a long list of users who had the same problem.  Some of these messages go back a couple years.

The wireless setup went pretty well, though I'm an engineer, so your mileage may vary. It worked well in our mixed Apple and PC environment, though I was a bit disappointed with the scanning. If you initiate the scan at the printer, it sometimes has trouble connecting to the computer, which it apparently needs to do. It would be much nicer if there were an option for the printer to create a PDF and email it to you (the HP printer/copier in my office can do this, and I thought it was the norm).<br /><br />I would have been willing to live with the sub-optimal scanning functionality if it could print envelopes. Sadly neither the original nor the replacement sent to me by Brother could print envelopes. Both reported a paper jam, when I could tell there was none. Even if it could have printed envelopes, the design would have still been pretty poor since printing envelopes requires not just opening the back port, but also rotating down two small green levers that are almost impossible to see without turning the unit completely around so you can look at the back side directly. That you need to do this is buried pretty deeply in the manual, but it is there.<br /><br />In short, it can't print envelopes, and even if it could, the steps the manufacturer says are necessary to do so are quite onerous.<br /><br />Printing envelopes was a must for me (who wants to hand address a hundred or more holiday cards!), so I returned the unit to Amazon.;;3.0;;January 4, 2012;;5;;7;;0.714286

HP has gotten cheaper and worse on its printers over time, but they are a lot better than Lexmark.<br /><br />Firstly, you will wrestle for hours trying to put the slender color ink cartridges in - and when you get one half way in, but not clipped in, the printer "being smart" will move the whole gizmo away thinking it is time for a printer test!  And the ink goes FAST.  So you will have to do this manuever often.  The black ink that comes with the initial purchase will print 15 pages of full color (color includes black) then be out.  You can buy a 3X black refill, but come on, why ship with a useless cartridge unless you are intentionally ripping customers off?  I get, it, you can make the retail price low by making a poor product, and including no ink, but seriously, this is insulting.<br /><br />Also, my printer keeps doing self checks.  I have to power it completely off or it will start up magically every few hours when I am trying to sleep in the same room.  Why?  What useful function can it be doing?  And no, I do not have Fax or auto-answer enabled.<br /><br />It is nice to put a stack of documents in the fax entry and scan them to a single pdf.  Too bad, if they are not perfect (i.e. minor curls are not), not all sheets will feed.  It loves to leave the last sheet not fed.  Great, I have a pdf of 9 out of 10 sheets.  Useless.<br /><br />The scanning software that comes with this is substandard.  HP had a scan system that previewed the image so you could crop, rotate, choose color/bw etc.  The software installe don your PC has none of that.  Scan and it will save it to PPT or jpg.  Then you need to use a photo editor to crop it/rotate.<br /><br />The auto detect looking for photo cards needs to be debugged.  When you have a memory card from your camera, it works fine.  But plug an ipod into another USB port, or sometimes even a USB drive (if it has jpg files on it) - and Lexmark gets confused that those just might be from a camera.  So, if you are trying to sync your ipod shuffle, it will keep disconnecting.  I can't autofill anymore.  I have to manually drag songs over, maybe 10 will copy over, before Lexmark "gets smart" even though I selected preference for it NOT to try to read that drive letter.  So, I manually drag songs from my music library in itunes, then click 'skip' in case I grabbed some that did make it over before.  It takes forever, and did not happen when I had an HP all-in-one attached.  I will say, that my HP driver had a conflict with my system, so after a week or so, I could not scan, and would have to unintally, reinstall.  Pain, which is why I looked for another vendor.  The printer, fax, memory card reader always worked on the HP, just not the scanning after a while.<br /><br />And ALL the Lexmark models that look like this (I looked in all of them at the store), have no way to open up the middle.  Yes, you can open to see a window with the ink cartridges, but you can't move that frame out.  I asked the salesmen, how do you clear a paper jam.  He said, he's had one for months and never had a jam.  Sales guys are required to lie, apparently.<br /><br />Stay away from this printer manufacturer unless you like junk.  The higher cost (more feature) models have the same ink, software and inability get inside to clear a jam.  Just because they have various snazzy touch screens, wireless, etc. is still putting lipstick on a pig.<br /><br />Awful, awful, awful.;;1.0;;February 28, 2010;;6;;13;;0.461538

I bought this one based on the reviews and the fact that it came with an Android-based tablet.  It was advertised to have fax capabilities out of the box as well.<br /><br />What I ended up getting was a substandard tablet with a rather substandard printer.  First off, the tablet is slow as heck.  Touch gestures on the tablet are not very responsive and opening apps are slow.  While I didn't expect iPad-like performance, this detachable "device" is just fluff to show off printing capabilities without a computer.  The apps on the tablet are mostly for printing, but there are a few bright spots (e-books, browser) but it's no iPad, not by a long shot.<br /><br />What really upset me was the fax capabilities are limited to a free monthly subscription to eFax, a service that allows sending and receiving of faxes through the internet.  When I say free, it's 20 free outbound and inbound faxes PER MONTH.  After that there is a fee per page.  I suppose I should have done more research on this printer, but I would have expected a real fax machine instead of eFax.<br /><br />For my money, it's better to buy the model behind this one with an ADF and true fax capabilities than spend extra for a tablet that comes with a printer with less features.;;2.0;;October 21, 2010;;28;;39;;0.717949

I was completely shocked and dismayed (and spent an hour on the phone with HP to tell them so) that HP wouldn't include a CRITICAL piece of equipment with this product. I repeat, you CANNOT connect this printer to your computer or wireless router without buying a USB cable separately. You wouldn't know it from the advertising for this product, so I'm telling you. If you don't already have the right cable at your home/home office/business, you need to buy one if you actually want to use this printer.  I am supremely annoyed.  HP wants it both ways: they want to exclude critical equipment so that they can advertise the lowest price BUT they don't want to tell you that they've excluded a critical component from the box.  What they get now is an irate customer.<br /><br />UPDATE: Several commenters have pointed out that excluding cables is standard, but I bought an HP laserjet printer 3 years ago that came with all required cables, so if it is common practice to exclude cables I wouldn't have known it from that previous purchase.  That said, I finally found a cable to connect to my new HP LaserJet Pro M1212nf printer and want to review the actual printer now.<br /><br />I own only Macs. The "easy/instant" install feature that is advertised for this product does not apply to Macs.  So, it was a tedious, old school process to install on my home network.  However, it worked. All the features work. Print quality is good. Biggest negative: this machine is LOUD! I was surprised since I've only ever owned HP laserjets and have always found them to be pretty quiet. Even my husband was startled by the loudness when he heard the printer start printing for the first time.  And the paper bin doesn't hold a big load of paper. I found myself thinking I would return the printer, but then remembered that I didn't pay very much for it, and that I should be setting my expectations to match the price point.  So, I upped my review by one star.  If you're willing to put up with the noise and a low-volume paper bin, and the headache of installing on a mac, then this is a good printer for the price.  Me? I like quality and I wish I had splurged for something a little higher up the quality scale.;;2.0;;October 2, 2010;;10;;67;;0.149254

I bought it to replace my HP that did duplex (if the software worked or I remembered to convert everything to a PDF first), to make copies from large books (HP definitely performed better on that with the removable hinged lid), and for the wireless (which HP managed to get right) so I can print from our laptops, phone, etc.  We ordered it through AAFES (at a crazy-low pricepoint) which ships directly from Epson.  We were happy to wait the 6 weeks that it was on backorder. I was so done with HP's ink that couldn't get the least bit damp and their buggy software on what I'd once considered an otherwise perfect printer (C7260 I think). Like my initial infatuation with the HP, this Epson seemed wonderful at first.  But only 3 mos. or so in...we've lost ability to print wirelessly 2x.  1st time about a month ago, called customer support and was on there FOREVER (you have to let them go through their spiel even though you've already done all the obvious troubleshooting)...only to add a "new" printer in the control panel and reinstall the whole thing (which is surprisingly NOT easy for some reason).  The explanation?  Only that sometimes updates (unclear whether Windows or what) will cause this to happen.  Well how often are sometimes?  Monthly?  What is so maddening is that the computer says the printer is ready.  Great!  The little green WiFi light on the printer indicating a wireless connection is lit up which is supposed to mean all systems are go.  Great!  But no printing from the access point (desktop) or the laptops. I get an error message on a network confirmation printout that everything is fine and connected and working properly, except that there is an access point channel conflict that we may want to remedy.  ???  Somewhere on an Epson web page I read that that means I should move the printer closer to the computer.  Ummm...it's approx 3 inches from the access point!  We use the wireless for the other laptops we have, but the main desktop (access point) is right there next to the dumb printer.  So...I'm back to deleting all 9 or 10 programs Epson puts on my computer for this one machine and reinstalling (so far unsuccessfully via temporary USB connection).  I can print with just the USB, but what good is that if I need to print from a laptop in another room (or in the same room if I so choose.  Boooo.  So I guess I have to go through this with the laptops too?  Absurd.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant.  Issue #2:  Red.  There is not a true red on my printer.  My HP printed red.  Not the Epson...it's a pinkish magenta.  That's fairly interesting and irritating (regardless of quality or paper selected).<br /><br />I do agree with other reviewers that the paper trays are ridiculously poor quality.  I'm not sure how you'd do strange sized paper.  The adjustable guides are really easy to move so they don't really function as "guides" at all.<br /><br />So...the only positives are that it looks cool, it prints quickly (although admittedly loudly), has a little touch screen, and the ink doesn't shmear and run if it gets wet (unlike HP stuff).  I have had no problem with the duplex and other settings.<br /><br />And again, the wireless setup has failed.  I'm very unimpressed.  The forums don't help much either; no useful answers for others' similar problems.  I honestly don't know a quick solution.  Each time it does this I waste hours of productivity.  Everything else connects to my WiFi (and even this printer according to all indications)...but the computer and printer refuse to talk wirelessly.<br /><br />4 hours after the initial problem...no wireless printer.

When I received it, I noticed that Fedex had relabeled a unit that was originally sent to somebody else. I should have returned it then and there, but made the mistake of taking it with myself overseas. On arrival I discoverd that the USB cable was missing. That was a minor problem since the worst was that the printer did not work and sent an error message indicating that there was a problem with the fuser. Contacting HP they told me that it had to be replaced. RedCore would not replace it because it has been over 30 days from the purchase (fair if those are the rules), but nevertheless I hope that whoever is considering purchasing an item from this seller thinks it twice before doing so. Summarizing: 1) relabeling of a product after shiping to a different buyer, 2) missing USB cable (so either it was not originally in the box or in the coming and going somebody took it), 3) mulfunctioning fuser (which is an expensive component). Buy elsewhere.;;1.0;;August 1, 2011;;5;;9;;0.555556

The selection is, for lack of a better word Awesome.  Though Amazon may not have the absolute best price on the net, Amazon is generally pretty close and trusted.  Hands down Amazon consistently beat the big box stores, so I thought. I purchased this printer about 2 weeks ago for $199.00<br /><br />*** Epson WorkForce 845 All-in-One Printer ***<br />After our old HP Printer died and some extensive research (cheaper ink, CNET Best "All-in-One Printer, paper capacity, etc...) I purchased this printer about 2 weeks ago for $199.00. The Epson 845 looks to be a good all-in-one, with dedicated fax, fast printing and 2 drawers with 500 sheet capacity, WiFi, easy setup, and a small form factor. Not a photo quality printer, but with most camera shops able to take care of this for you at a lesser cost it was not an issue for us..<br />I have not had it long so I cannot accurately say what the longevity of this printer is, but I am confident we will have relatively few issues with this all-in-on. Over all I am please with the "Epson WorkForce 845 All-in-One Printer".<br /><br />***Price***<br />At a price of $199.00 I believed the "Epson WorkForce 845 All-in-One Printer" was neither over nor underpriced. Though my HP printer was much cheaper the ink cost 2X more and at a third of the volume of what this Epson offers, so I knew I would be saving in the long run.<br />That being said, after going in to my local "Big Box" Staples for some supplies I needed ASAP (otherwise I would have ordered from Amazon) I saw the same "Epson WorkForce 845 All-in-One Printer" for a little over $100.00. Even after 5% sales tax that is a considerable savings in my eyes.<br />Taking this into account I give the " Epson WorkForce 845" 2 stars if purchased through Amazon do to its cost to quality factor.  If purchasing from Stapes 5+ Stars, a very good deal.<br /><br />***Postscript***<br />So...  A long review,  more about my opinion and disappointment that a big box store beat my beloved Amazon on price by a considerable margin. I have until now been confident that Amazon was going to have the best price to customer service and shipping cost (Free, most of the time for me) ratio out there, especially over the local big box stores.<br />A lesson felt is a lesson learned, and I felt this one in my wallet pretty hard.<br />My advice - If you have the time shop around at your local Big Box Stores, they may have better prices and some awesome deals that would have otherwise been missed. I know I will.<br />I'll be sure to be more diligent in my research and not default to Amazon.<br />Also, the same Staples store had a Cisco 8 port gigabit switch I was looking at getting for about 25% less then Amazon pricing. That was there every day price from what I could tell, not a sale or promo.<br /><br />***To Amazon***<br />If you (an Amazon employee - representative) read this.  Please consider a price matching policy that applies to just more than Televisions. Would renew my confidence that Amazon could be my primary shopping destination..;;2.0;;October 23, 2011;;22;;82;;0.268293

Even though my  printing needs are limited, I passed over several less expensive lasers because I wanted a solid product with good performance, easy installation and no hassles.  I should have saved my money; the 1022 has the look and feel of something you might pick up for $19.98 at Walgreens.<br /><br />It goes without saying that there is no published instructional manual furnished with the item.  (Yes, I know; there never is these days, but I don't have to like this corner-cutting.) There is however a two-sided sheet - labeled "Start" in 4 languages - which is all the written text help you get. It consists of 9 numbered pictures.  The pictures are considerably less than self-explanatory. After spending much time trying to puzzle these out, and there being no teenager in the house, I finally asked my poor wife to rescue me (her HP 4ML dates from only 1995, so she's more up to speed on this new-fangled hardware).  There are more pictures and lights on the printer's exterior panel, but no identifying text. What each of these means is not intuitively obvious.<br /><br />So far, I'm getting crisp text output very quickly.  That's good. But if something goes wrong, I'm expected to wade through megabytes of "online help" (the PDF "manual" is 128 densely packed virtual pages), when all I'd probably need is a 20 or 30 page pamphlet that addresses the basics.  Oh well.<br /><br />HP helpfully provides a power cord so that I can plug the thing in and turn it on.  That's terribly nice of them. But no USB cord is included, so if you want to actually print something, too bad. Printing requires a separate trip to Radio Shack.  Penny wise, pound foolish -- poor show, HP.<br /><br />I paid over $600 (in 1991 dollars) for my trusty HP 4. That may seem like a lot today, but I got my money's worth - and much more. I'm not at all confident I will feel the same about this HP 1022 in the year 2023 - or even in 2008.;;2.0;;September 22, 2007;;1;;8;;0.125

The price was steep at $500. but with the promised $100. rebate, that brought it down to an affordable amount for my limited retirement budget.  I figured I could swing $400. for it.  And it seemed like a very good printer to boot.  After receiving the printer, I filled out all the neccessary paper work with proof of purchase and carefully mailed it to them.  To date, I never received a rebate and there is no number or web site to contact them at.  I feel I have been cheated out of the promised $100.  I will never buy an Ebson product again.  I rated the product only one star because the price was part of the deal and I probably would have purchased another cheaper brand except for the rebate.  If you plan on purchasing this printer, keep in mind you may be paying full price and may never get your promised rebate. As for the quality of the prints, A cheaper brand would probably do as well.  Pfuuut!.........Aug.7 update!  Still no rebate check sent to me.  I wrote a formal letter to their headquarters explaining my issue, two months ago and received NO response.  Customer service is zero.  I don't think this printer is worth $500.  I should have bought a $99. Lexmark printer from HSN.  I think I would have gotten a better deal.;;1.0;;May 22, 2012;;4;;30;;0.133333

I am still waiting for one of them to call me back after saying they needed to investigate the problem further... (and will call me back - hahaha).<br />The system will not even allow you to uninstall the maintenance feature to re-install it, it is plainly locked out of any control.  I even hired an online professional computer repair company to try to fix or uninstall the maintenance toolbox and it can't be done.<br />In order to clear the data from this printer you must wipe your entire hard drive clean of any traces of HP software - furthermore the newest HP software likes to take control of your computer by constantly updating and scanning you machine.<br />Hey I don't know about you but I think a printer should do just that - PRINT ..., not control my computer and scan and rescan for updates and controls - thanks HP but no thanks.<br />Take a lesson from me, I learned the hard and expensive way that this printer will disappoint you with multiple break-downs and HP is either unwilling to or unable to help with the service they claim to provide.<br />But what about the Guarantee...???

We were able to lower the volume, but it will not let us turn the ringer off completely.<br /><br />In order to fax, copy, or scan, you must select a specific button first, select your options, then press the start button. On the HP, you would select your options and then press the start button. There was no need to press an extra button at the beginning of the process.<br /><br />Our HP machine will continue to make copies even after there is no toner left, which can be a problem when you don't realize you are making worthless copies. The Brother machine will refuse to make copies once the toner gets low, but still has a bit left. This was nice at first, but we aren't able to get as much out of each toner cartridge. The other issue with this is that putting in a new toner cartridge resets the machine. If the toner is not absolutely brand new and untouched, or is defective, it will not reset the machine and you cannot make any copies. I am currently dealing with this issue. Two new toners have not reset the machine. We are currently unable to receive faxes and make copies on the Brother machine.<br /><br />The very last issue means I would not recommend buying a Brother machine.<br /><br />Added 08/24/2011:<br />Talking to the brother customer support, I was told that we cannot use anything except genuine brother toner in order for the reset to work properly. All these machines and on will have this reset switch. On the brother webpage they talk about their brother earth site and that they are working with us for a better environment, yet you cannot recyle the toner.;;2.0;;August 18, 2011;;19;;27;;0.703704

Eventually able to set up printer manually with tech support. Problems with wireless connectivity cost me three days on the phone with technical support.<br /><br />General experience with Brother technical support on this very poor. Very long wait times (typically 20-25 minutes), and staff not prepared to support this product. Every person was clearly reading from a scripted flow chart, and every new person I spoke with began at the beginning. This meant, for example, that I reset the printer and entered codes at least 8 separate times. At one point I was connected with someone that was supposed to help with "advanced" problems. That person was unhelpful.<br /><br />I was advised on my last call that if connection to router lost, I will be forced to manually reconfigure it again. Technical support was supposed to email me directions by email about how to do this, but sent me directions for a different issue all together.<br /><br />Now that it is set up, the product itself is just barely adequate. Another review mentioned that the scanner cannot, for example, place multiple pages into a single document, but instead generates a new document for every single scan. This is a basic functionality problem. Another reviewer correctly pointed out that this problem can be corrected with further software, for instance Adobe. But given that this is a scanner, it should not need additional software to, well, scan more than one page at a time.<br /><br />In short, I regret this purchase. The machine itself is barely workable, and I pray that I will not have to reconfigure it again. I am giving it 2 stars in recognition of the fact that it is a relatively cheap product (paid $147). If I was to do it again I would buy a separate scanner with full functionality and a separate laser printer. This "all-in-one" has turned out to be very inconvenient. I will be avoiding Brother products in the future.;;2.0;;July 30, 2011;;3;;11;;0.272727

No, I detest this printer.  I have been printing small books and booklets on it and it doesn't print 2-sided automatically, however, I could live with that!  The problems are that:<br /><br />1.  Every time it prints a job, whether 1 page or 20, it has to go through this 15-30 second or so clunking and chunking and if you put paper in while it is doing that it will suck it up into the feeder.  So if you print one side, you have to wait, wait, wait for it to finish, then load the paper in prep for printing the second side.<br /><br />2.  Once you put it in for printing the second side, an awful lot of the time, it will misfeed the paper so that you have to start all over again.  I can not tell you how aggravating this is.  Not only have I wasted a lot of paper and ink, but I have also wasted a whole lot of my time.<br /><br />3.  If you print on cardstock or other heavy paper, it will sometimes print the item out and then suck it back up into the printer causing a paper jam.  Consequently, you can't print multiples of cardstock.  You have to print 1 and go to the printer to grab it as it comes out, then go back to the computer and print 1, etc.  Ridiculous.<br /><br />4.  NOTE:  If you have a paper jam with this printer and try to clear it from the front of the printer, you could make the printer inoperable.  It tells you this in the documentation, however, in my opinion, there should be a sticker on the front of the printer telling you that!  When something that people often do can cause the printer to be inoperable, it should be front and center, not buried in documentation!<br /><br />I would NOT buy this printer again nor would I ever recommend it to anyone who wants to print 2-sided.<br /><br />I hate this printer.

I've tried FireFox and IE8 on a XP machine and FireFox and Safari on a mac.  The navigation buttons disappears after you switch pages and the images don't load until you hold your pointer over them.  It is just flaky as can be.  Then, to make things worse, when I do attempt to change a setting, I get an "error on page" warning in IE8.  So, I can't change settings.<br /><br />The manual is also full of errors.  It is like it was written for a different machine and pasted into this machines manual and not fully updated to be accurate with this machine.

If Xerox reads this, look how it tells you to set SMTP in the browser based interface and then look at the reality of where the SMTP settings are.<br /><br />I called Xerox and he confirmed the errors in the instructions and confirmed that it isn't compatible with hardly any "new" browsers.  He said it worked with a lot of outdated versions of popular browsers.  He had me download OPERA rather than reverting to an older version of IE.  Now it works fine, but I still have to figure it out without much help from the manual as it is not written with any degree of accuracy.<br /><br />T;;2.0;;July 20, 2009;;13;;18;;0.722222

The store named Best Buy claims to have a 30 return policy. I bought an HP printer from the so-called Best Buy store and I soon ran out of ink.  I also had a terrible time with the HP printer.  The HP printer had very little ink, it took forever too get the printer to start, it made a lot of noise when compared to other Brand named printers, it took a long time to print let alone shut down and it printed a test page that used up a great amount of INK without me directing it to.  The HP printer also has very little INK that comes with the HP printer and when I purchased extra regular INK cartridges I ran out very soon. I found this out with HP printers; very little INK.  If you buy a regular HP ink cartridge you are buying what I call a sample HP INK cartridge since it runs out of ink quickly.  If you think about it the HP cartridges that show 2.5 times more INK are the same size as the regular cartridges.  You then have to ask, "how much ink do they really put in the regular OVER priced HP INK cartridges"?  I considered myself cheated when I bought the regular sized cartridge.  My personal opinion is that the HP 2.5 times more INK cartridges run out after printing only about 50% more than the regular overpriced HP INK cartridges while you end up paying a lot more.<br />The only good thing about my experience with the Best Buy store is that I was able to try out the HP INK supply and the printers' performance!  I could suggest doing the same but I won't.  I will state that I wasn't shy returning the HP printer to the Best Buy store because I was not afraid of this chain store and I was not satisfied with the performance of the HP Printer.  Best Buy says you have 30 days to return the HP Printer you should have 30 days but this is a misnomer!  I tried the HP printer I bought from the Best Buy store and I didn't like its performance.  The Best Buy store states that you can return it within 30 days for a full refund if you don't like its performance.  I took the Best Buy store for their word and I returned the HP printer to the Best Buy store after 25 days of use.  The Best Buy store would not take the return without me signing a statement stating that I would not return anything I buy until after a 90-day period from the time I returned the HP Printer.  I should have told them to F off and accept my return without signing their statement.  The Best Buy store also wants a photo ID from everyone when they return something.  If the item is being charged back to your credit card then you should not have too give them any ID!  This amounts too invasion of privacy (Big Brother).  AMAZON IS THE BEST BUY!  AMAZON DOES NOT ASK FOR A PHOTO ID!<br />My opinion is that the Best Buy store is not the BEST BUY! I believe Amazon is the BEST BUY!<br />MY OPINION IS THAT Amazon does have the BEST BUY.  Amazon is not like the so-called Best Buy store.  It is my opinion that Amazon ALWAYS gives you the BEST BUY.  I will stay committed to Amazon and quit buying from the so-called Best Buy store.  Amazon has fantastic delivery, great service, in most states no tax, in most cases free shipping, extended warranties are available and Amazon will take care of any problems immediately, unlike the so-called Best Buy store!;;1.0;;August 12, 2012;;0;;7;;0.0

First off, despite the fact that I used the button on the printer to print in black and white and not color, it STILL used the tricolor cartridge, and it ran out before I even printed six pages!  Finding out that the tricolor cartridge was empty, I used the HP Deskjet 1050 J410 series icon on my desktop created by the install disc that came with this product, selected Printer Actions, Set Preferences, Layout tab, Advanced button, and, in the Print in Grayscale line, I chose Black Ink Only.  When I tried to print something out, it STILL gave me a pop-up, saying "Ink Cartridge Failure. HP TriColor. Cartridges listed above are damaged or have failed. Remove them and replace with new cartridges."  And, the cartridges cost HOW many dollars each?  Getting less than six pages copied for that much money is NOT worth it.

DO NOT BUY!;;When this thing works, it works very well; thus I gave it 5 stars for attributes. But those attributes don't include reliability, ink use and ease of use - and for those it doesn't deserve even one star. We got this piece of crap at Christmas 2010 - 10 months later we're still cursing it as it goes through its little games. We've spent at least twice as much on ink as we did on the printer itself, and we really don't print much - less than 1,000 pages a year at most, and a cartridge should be good for 300 or so pages, according to Canon. Yet we're on our 5th or 6th set of cartridges. Oh, and BTW, this p.o.c. uses SIX cartridges, but try to find a pack of more than 5 - they always leave out the gray, and sometimes the big black, too, so you have to hunt around for those two. Why? Oh, I don't know - incompetence maybe?<br /><br />Anyway, it's constantly giving us error messages for no reason at all. Right now it's "Printer error. Turn machine off and turn it back on. If problem persists, see the manual." The error message says C000. There is no such error message in the manual. There is a 6000 error message though. Is this what Canon meant to say? Which is wrong - the manual or the LCD?<br /><br />The p.o.c. is constantly telling us "no connection." It takes forever to turn itself on when you click print, but it shuts itself off very quickly. You send a message for it to print, and the LCD says "processing," as the p.o.c. sends its little motors whirring and the cartridges and whatever moving back and forth and clicking and pausing and clicking and whirring and pausing and moving back and forth and...ad nauseam. Often it doesn't turn itself on at all when you click print, so you have to go turn it on manually. Sometimes it says there is no paper when the tray is full. It can't detect one sheet of paper - like when you want to use photo paper and you don't want it to pull regular paper through at the same time.<br /><br />I've had lots of printer experience, and printers in general are incredibly poorly engineered considering the advancements in computers - they're still like horse-and-buggy by comparison. And for this one, the emphasis is on buggy. Oh, and the ink is expensive - each time we get six cartridges (if we can find them) it costs us about $90. Well, $90 every two months or so is way, way out of line. Not only will I never buy another Canon printer, I will never buy another Canon anything. I'm seriously considering fixing this p.o.c. with my sledgehammer and sending it back to them.;;1.0;;September 28, 2011;;5;;7;;0.714286

Maybe I'm cheap but I want my printer to keep printing until I can't read it. I don't care if it's faded. I tried every suggestion but nothing has worked. It just stops printing when the cartridge is low. Basically, its a way for them to make money. If you can't milk the cartridge for every bit you paid for, then you have to buy cartridges more often.<br /><br />Also, the high yield cartridge is impossible to find anywhere but on the internet which makes it difficult when you are purchasing on a restricted business account.

I tried to print a letter on special stationary and the Epson Workforce 545 could not process the pages. In retrospect, I wish I read the negative reviews more carefully.<br /><br />The front control panel has a swivel system that is not all that intuitive. I learned the hard way that the swivel should not be adjusted beyond about 45 degrees.<br /><br />There are connectors that become damaged when the front panel swivel is pulled beyond the 45 degree angle point. The printer has some cheap controls that are supposed to prevent this type of "incorrect" behavior, but they did not function at my house. Someone in my family, (probably a kid) broke the control panel within this printer's first week at my house. I would not recommend this printer to anyone who is not willing to treat it with kit gloves.<br /><br />Also, I was surprised by how quickly I ran through the small amount of black printer ink in the printer catridge. The printer cartridge is much smaller than most other printers which means the money you save on the purchase price will be consumed by frequent trips to the office supply store to buy more ink.;;1.0;;July 4, 2012;;5;;9;;0.555556

Great quality, but I am ALWAYS changing cartridges. In the past I have had quite a bit of experience with other Epson printers and they all seem to use ALOT of ink. An epson representative once told me that with a single cartridge of black ink you should be able to get about 200 note cards worth of printing (black text). Not too good. I was printing onto 3x5 note cards. The thing I have noticed with Epson printers is that when the color is empty it will not allow you to print with only the black cartridge. You must spend the money on color cartridges even if you are only printing black text. Even more annoying than this is that you cannot refill Epson cartridges. Somehow the printer knows and registers the cartridge as empty and will not print. The software even goes as far as to not have any settings to allow you to use less ink (by lowering the print quality). Every single thing you print is at full quality. If you have the money to spend this is a good printer. We have an on standing order with our purchasing department for ink, that's how bad this thirsty beast is.;;2.0;;July 9, 2008;;14;;19;;0.736842

Each time I asked to be conected with someone in the US that was english speaking and I was told that they were english speaking.  I think that they will not connect you to the US because it might reflect poorly on them.

Suffice it to say that I have logged many non-productive hours trying to get this set up so that it works properly.  I may be close.  The only thing that only works sporadicaly is the fax now.

With all of the (very limited) print quality settings dialed in at best, little difference is noticeably with any level of tinkering or adjusting. Not much to it.<br /><br />Not kidding, the result is not far off from my recollection of an old Apple Imagewriter II. And YES, I am talking about the CMYK dot matrix. Of the many things I print (most of little importance) I print customer proposals (with home floor plans). Lines are fuzzy. Text is fuzzy. The color is very dull with prominent banding and conspicuous half tones. Printing a simple web page, email or other document--it does not matter--the quality of B&W text is bad to the point of being distracting. Keep in mind this is with all of the settings cranked. If a simple document looks bad, it will slaughter a logo or a photo. Do not be fooled by the expedient specifications (at least with respect to scanning and printing quality).<br /><br />If print quality is even of slight interest (which it should if you if your are shopping for a color unit as most B&W scan in color), go with your intuition and buy a Canon or HP, perhaps consider a Minolta or Xerox, BUT DO NOT BOTHER WITH THE BROTHER.<br /><br />I never write reviews, but this was that big of a letdown. In the morning I am boxing it up and sending it back--with a tear or two.;;1.0;;September 28, 2012;;1;;5;;0.2

It is the worst printer I have ever seen and the biggest purchasing mistake I have ever made.<br /><br />I was very excited because it has all of the features I want --wireless, two-sided printing, scanner,copier, and fax and NOT ONE OF THE FEATURES WORK.<br /><br />Most of the time, it won't print all. If it does, it takes up to two minutes for one document. The onscreen printer status message gets stuck on my PC monitor, and the only way to get rid of it is to go into task manager and manually deleted. Even though I have registered, I cannot stop the registration from appearing time I try to print. It, too, gets hung up. Yep, you guessed it -- the ony way to get rid of it is to manually delete it through Windows task manager.<br /><br />The wireless feature will not work, so I cannot use printer sharing for my home network.<br /><br />It contains an executable file called, "Lexmark Connect" that is spyware, and, not only can I not cannot get rid of it, it also gets stuck and here I go back to task manager.<br /><br />The two-sided printing function works only with cheap, thin paper. It will not work with any kind of heavier bond or card stock paper.<br /><br />I seriously recommend that anyone wishing to spend this much money and who wants a printer that works, keep on looking.

So far in only a few weeks of heavy use, the printer has performed flawlessly. The set up was very easy (do NOT throw away any cables from your old machines as some don't come with then new ones). All my previous printer settings (very laboriously set up) used for the C88 were saved and transfered over with software installation, saving me a lot of work. Note: follow the set up instructions out of the box to the letter and you will have no problems. I then downloaded and installed the latest driver update and have had no  difficulties. It has a very small foot print (nice for my cluttered work space) and has a quiet mode to make the noise a bit less when printing and the wife in the next room is sleeping.<br /><br />All in all for around eighty bucks or less if you shop on line, this new Epson Workforce 30 fits my needs perfectly. I would recommend it to for the occasional user like myself. Also note: when shopping for ink jets, always keep in mind the replacement costs for ink. If you print a lot this will be a MAJOR factor. I shopped around the internet and this model has a replacement ink cartridge that is not TOO expensive. Then it is only around a month old from mfg. market, so cheap ink is not available yet, but will be in a month or two. My C88 worked fine for many months using ink that cost less than a third of OEM ink from Epson. Now they will scream at voiding the warranty, BUT when OEM ink costs as much as a NEW printer, use the cheap ink- what do ya have to loose?;;5.0;;October 22, 2008;;5;;7;;0.714286

I can't say enough about this printer. The print quality is outstanding...far better than any commercial print I've ever purchased. And that's not just color. B&W is fantastic...deep, rich blacks all the way through the gamut. The fact that I can now produce large (up to 13 x 19, though I generally stay with A3, or 12 x 16, paper) versions of my photographs with such startling results has me in a printing, matting, and framing frenzy!<br /><br />Admittedly, the ink is expensive. Each set of 8 cartridges runs about $110, but I consider it very worthwhile. Additionally, the Epson software (I'm using it with a Macintosh) makes it spectacularly easy to order new cartridges from Epson. If you order more than three colors, Epson ships them overnight or two day for free! The only problem I've had with the R2880 is trying to print on Epson's Velvet Fine Art Paper. The few prints I tried on it bled. I haven't tried to troubleshoot this with Epson, as I've fallen in love with their Ultra Premium Photo Paper Luster and do nearly all of my printing on that paper.<br /><br />I can't recommend this printer too highly. I've you're a serious photographer, you need this printer. I haven't used one, but I'd imagine the R3880, which is even larger format, prints similarly but for about $400 more. 13 x 19 is plenty large enough for me right now.;;5.0;;November 4, 2009;;3;;5;;0.6

The setup is not intuitive as one would think.  I noted several reviews where the issue was failure to follow the instructions and not the fault of the instructions.<br />Now to my review.  The first 837 I bought stopped working during its initial set-up stage.  The power button appears to have failed.  I returned it and received a second unit.<br />For the second unit the setup procedure (for wireless) went perfectly.  Before I needed to use the installation CD (while following the written instructions), the unit's screen instructions quickly lead me through step-by-step to a perfect wireless setup. There was no need to use the CD and no need for a temporary USB cable (by the way, if you plan to connect via USB, the USB cable is not the standard USB to USB...it needs a specific connector to the 837)<br />I am using it on a wireless network and wanted my Toshiba Thrive android tablet to access it.  I found out too late that the Epson iprint app for android units does not let you send documents at this time....while the same program for Macs does...go figure.<br />I tried Google Cloud Print which does work but took a while to research.<br />The Thrive comes with its own wireless print app that only partially works but that's another review.<br />Another complaint is that the unit defaults to cd/dvd mode and I have emailed Epson as to why and can that be corrected.  If anyone has a solution, contact me.<br />Yet another complaint/observation is that the ink supplied is Epson's standard cartridge (99) rather then their high capacity cartridge (98).  So when you buy replacements buy the large capacity units.<br />Finally the size of the cartridges is small.  I have two other Epsons with cartridges that are twice the size (volume?).;;3.0;;October 29, 2011;;4;;7;;0.571429

It tells me I've got a paper jam long after I've cleared it. I've had to shut it down twice because it kept flashing and belling. It's kind of an annoying machine. Maybe after a few months I'll have it better figured out, but I wanted it to be easy and intuitive, and it definitely is not.

Not nice, and it makes me think twice about buying on Amazon.<br /><br />PS: I got a lot of grief from other reviewers for giving a poor initial review based on the price bait and switch and not the product. While it didn't reflect the product, it did reflect the buying experience both with Amazon and HP, and I believe it's valid.

It saddens me that as a loyal HP consumer I have been treated with disdain and total disregard for my needs as a consumer.  Fortunately, Espon is now marketing a new printer that would suit my business needs.  I can only hope that they have a higher regard for their product and customer than HP.  HP refused to take back a product that is nonfunctional or credit me for its value in exchange for a higher priced product even though the product I purchasd is still under warranty.

We wanted a laser printer as an ink toner cartridge that lasts 500 pages won't go far with 30-40 page documents.  That said we spent quite a bit of time looking around and we found the Brother HL-2280 Printer was a small and inexpensive device which takes a Brother TN-450 toner cartridge that provides a decent cost per page.  My girlfriend went to Staples to play with and purchase the said printer and the cashier, the clerk informed her that the starter toner in the printer would only print 20 (twenty) pages before running out, and therefore she should purchase a new toner to go with it; he offered to sell her a TN-420.  Really?  Lying Thieves, thankfully she wasn't suckered in by this gimmick.  For reference, the printer comes with a TN-420 toner cartridge which according to staples.com prints 1,200 pages.  I can only assume that the pimply geek with huge gauge holes in his ears was flat out lying in order to get her to purchase a toner cartridge and improve his sales attach rate.  Also, the two year warranty is only 29.99.  Thanks, we'll pass. I hope it dies before two years is up so it can fill a dumpster somewhere.<br /><br />Step 1) Plug in, configure wifi (Fail #1)<br />With the printer at home I plug it in, and turn it on.  Open the menu, go to wifi and use the wifi protected setup menu, which i've admittedly never used.  I choose the option where it gives me a code that i type in to the router, and then the devices pair.  60 seconds later my belkin router says device connected successfully, and the printer spits out a page saying failed.  I tried a couple variations of this and eventually gave up.  Ultimately I connected to the printer via an ethernet cable, connected to the web interface with the default username of admin and the default password of password and managed to configure the wireless from there.<br /><br />Step 2) Connect to computer (Fail #2)<br />I used the add a printer wizard in Windows 7 and to my delight it was quickly detected.  Except the printer driver wasn't found.  I went to the brother website and download the printer driver, installed it via computer management and I'm off to the races!<br /><br />Step 3) Print a document (The only successful step)<br />It prints. Oh, and it can print on both sides / duplex perfectly.<br /><br />Step 4) Scan a document (Fail #3)<br />I press the scan button expecting the scan to email function similar to other brother AIO's I've used.  It says check connection.  This device can only perform the scanning functions through the brother software.  No problem I say! I download the 130MB software, install it (reboot required... ugh it's 2011), and scan a document.  All of the defaults scan to JPG, including scan to email or file.  I change it to default to PDF and go to scan my document.  As it turns out, this brother All In One HL-2280DW IS NOT CAPABLE of scanning multiple pages in to a single document.  Say you want to scan and email a 2 page document, you will need to scan it in to two separate files and email them separately.  The scanner we had some 12 or 15 years ago was capable of this simple functionality.  Press scan, it scans the document, asks you if there are any more pages, and either scans the next page or finishes with the file.<br /><br />Step 5) Return for full refund.<br />Reason stated on return claim: defective.<br /><br />My Backstory:<br />I have installed and used multiple brother all in one laser devices (which don't have the majority of these issues) and figured I'd give them a shot since at the budget end their cost per page is far lower than the competing HP model (1.7c/page vs 5c/page).  I have no previous hatred of brother until this new device was purchased (and about to become returned).<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />It turns out it is possible to scan multiple pages.  The preferences menu doesn't show the option, but if you right click on the email or file button for example, and go to settings you get almost the exact same menu you find under preferences, but it has a checkbox for manual scan.  It does work.  The downside is you must return to your computer to press the next page button, and the software on the computer effectively does a new scan job and stitches the two together.  This is clearly a piece of equipment meant for scanning one page things, and the software isn't well designed (why does the checkbox only show up on right click -> settings, instead of the main preferences tab you get?;;2.0;;July 11, 2011;;19;;29;;0.655172

(12 workers) I had some trouble setting up the printer through our "pront server" as the install disk did not allow such an installation.  I called Brother tech support and spoke to someone without an "accent" who I could understand. The support tech was fairly knowledgable but seemed to be flipping through he install guide to help me with the process. Bottom line was I figured out how to hook it up to our print server and now the entire office uses the machine. I was replacing an HP 850 ink jet and the laser is a wonderful swap.  We use about 1 ream of paper per week in all functions including copying, printing faxing and scanning.  All the features work well and the speed of printing blows the HP ink jet away.  The speed of the fax function is what we like the best as the MFC accepts 20 or so pages, scans them quickly into the memory, and proceeds to send them out.  Much better than our past machine.  I would recommend this to anyone in a small office environment. The only reason I did not give it a full 5 star rating was the lack of instructions for connecting to a print server.;;4.0;;August 14, 2011;;3;;5;;0.6

I bet Brother honchos were smirking as they executed what had to have been a silly design concept to begin with.<br /><br />This printer is an over-sized, cumbersome, annoying toy. Cheap-looking, poorly constructed, and is the only loud printer I've ever had. Each time it prints it sounds as if it's breaking.  The sound is unsettling and unpleasant, sorta like fingernails across a chalkboard.<br /><br />The envelope-printing feature appears to have been added as an afterthought.  It's like somebody said, "Hey, we forgot to include a way to feed envelopes," then stuck that ridiculous flap on the BACK of the machine. Brother should be embarrassed turning out such junk.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars, instead of 1, only because it does print, albeit loudly; it does scan, albeit one original page at a time; it does copy, albeit one original at a time. (Wish I'd noticed before my purchase that this thing doesn't have a document feeder.)<br /><br />This isn't the most expensive laser printer out there, but it's not the cheapest either. I expected it to work like a $200 printer, not a $59 one. I'm outta here.  I've had two Brother printers; there won't be a third.;;2.0;;April 19, 2012;;4;;15;;0.266667

Well, it is NOT easy at all.<br />Any help from those who have successfully done the wireless hook up is really appreciated.<br /><br />I followed the wireless setup instruction and successfully connected the printer to my home<br />wireless router.  The next step is where I had problem:  I installed the CD software, which<br />comes with the printer, to my MacBook Pro (running Leopard, i.e., OS X10.5.8), with no<br />apparent problem.  But when I tried to locate (or detect) the printer using the newly installed<br />canon network tool.  The software said that no printer was found.  After a long struggle<br />with no success,  I tried to re-install the software.  Then it was just hung indefinitely.<br />(Another reviewer has also reported this before.)<br /><br />My Macbook Pro is a standard APPLE machine with no fancy softwares installed.  I followed<br />Canon's instruction step by step, and still could not make the printer work.  Furthermore,<br />I could not find a Canon customer or technical phone number on the installation instruction<br />booklet either.  So my experience so far is rather poor with this printer.<br /><br />Update on 08/18/2011:<br /><br />I finally installed it on a newly bought PC with Window 7.  The installation worked<br />as instructed.  So far, we have been using it for a couple of months.<br />Its ink consumption is quite a disappointment.  The reason is that the ink cartridge<br />holds much less ink than, for example, the ink cartridges used for our previous<br />Canon printer i960.  But these ink cartridges are selling at more or less the same<br />price. In this sense, you pay more $ for running this MG5220 printer.<br /><br />Updated on 08/24/2011:<br /><br />The ink consumption on Canon MG5220 is really ridiculously fast --- the larger black ink cartridge runs out after maybe 30 pages printing. Each new set of the 5 ink cartridges costs $54 at Costco.com plus tax.  As a result, I just bought a new black and white Brother laser printer (HL-2270DW) to use, and reserve the Canon printer to photo printing only.

I got that, knowing I would be hauling the printer around in my car (if it worked), and it would need protection.  The case is a very snug fit,  but it does the job of protecting the unit.<br /><br />A word to the wise: Never install printer cartridges until you know the printer will work.

However, it is better to be tethered to the piece of carp than to keep getting scans that lock up and won't finish and half printed pieces of paper.  For some reason it no longer can figure out the difference better the photo paper in the rear and the plain paper in the cassette, had to change the settings to convince it was all plain paper from the rear cassette.  After this experience I will NEVER BUY ANOTHER CANON PRODUCT...not cameras, not copiers, and certainly not printers.  If you are wondering why I feel compelled to write a third review it is because I am shopping for a replacement on Amazon.com.<br /><br />--- Third update on the worst printer I have ever owned.<br /><br />I have now had this printer a month and a half, and I felt compelled to actually lower my review from two stars to one.  It is a piece of junk.  It already ran out of ink, the replacement ink is between 45 and 60 dollars, and you cannot refill it yourself, nor are their even suitable aftermarket brands, nor will Costco refill it.  The print quality is subpar, even if you use the rear photo tray, and adjust it, it is just not that great.  When it runs out of ink the printer basically shuts itself down, for some reason it won't let you scan as you did before or print even in black and white if you have run out of any one color.  I have been trying to scan for several days, since the ink ran out even restoring it to the original settings, but its like it gave up.  It is absolutely terrible.  As I said before it is bulky and was bad to setup, overall DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.<br /><br />--- Original Review from February 15, 2011 - 2 Stars (mainly because it was so difficult to setup, bulky, and the print quality was not great)<br /><br />I purchased the printer using Amazon.  The printer arrived quickly, and I was instantly stunned by the size of the box.  The unit is much larger than anticipated, and cannot even begin to find adequate area.  Despite the claimed size, it does not account for all the extra trays that need to be opened or the clearance for scanning.  The position of the screen is also annoying.  Setup was a nightmare.  I am using two Macs (OSX 10.6), the software took forever to load, and the instructions were not easy to follow from setup of the machine to the software setup.  Of course it loads the canonware, which is annoying because now I have to figure out how to get it off the computer.  On the second computer I merely went to the site and got the drivers and loaded them.  The WPS setup for wireless using push button was the only part that was easy.<br /><br />The print quality is ok.  They give you a few pieces of gloss photo paper.  Overall, I wish I would have seen several of the printers I later saw at the store, I am definitely envious, I would have much preferred to have a 4 in 1 with a autoload tray for scanning like the Lexmark 901 for 50 dollars more, plus had the option of the fax, I had assumed that the unit would not be as large without those options, turns out I was wrong.  I already have a HP 1102w laser printer, so I am using up valuable office real estate for this printer, but the wife wanted a color printer.<br /><br />One day the printer will no doubt break, and I will see what else is out there...hopefully Canon will develop a better setup guide.;;1.0;;February 16, 2011;;5;;9;;0.555556

They were very respectful.  Only problem is, this machine is a piece of crap.  It's supposed to be a multi-function device, but the only "function" that works on this thing is the printer--so why pay more for the other, dysfunctional, functions?<br /><br />FAX<br /><br />The first problem is this machine HAS NEVER SUCCESSFULLY SENT A FAX.  I have tried at least 30 times, and some of the faxes are practically blank.  Now, like most people these days, I have digital phone service and one of the settings is for "basic" mode so it can be used with "inferior" digital phone service.  Yet even in basic mode, it has never once successfully sent a fax.  The support people blamed it all on the digital phone line.  I was treated to a 5-minute lecture about digital voice and bandwidth, which started with the statement "we do not support [digital phone service]".  While they blamed the problems on the phone service, they could not explain why I get 5 different error messages for the same "problem."  They also could not explain why I have never before had this problem in 7 years of digital phone service.<br /><br />The worst part is that this machine keeps resending the failed faxes over and over, without me asking it to do so, and it then prints several stupid 1-line reports repeating that the faxes failed.  Well duh!  There was already an error message on screen and a beeping noise telling me that each fax failed--again.  Customer support tells me that these settings (atomatic repeated attempts to fax without change of settings, and wasting paper and ink on numerous/redundant 1-line error messages) are permanent and cannot be changed.<br /><br />SCANNING<br /><br />Not only does the fax not work, but some SCAN FUNCTIONS HAVE STOPPED WORKING.  I use this machine for online banking, among other things.  My bank's website controls the scanner remotely when I deposit a check online, but the scan/deposit function has recently stopped working and I get various error messages instead.<br /><br />OTHER<br /><br />There are also a lot of quirks about this machine that I just don't like, but which are not primary functions.  For example: I have my home-office phone running through the fax machine.  Every time I use the phone, the machine and its display click on for the duration of my call; they then shut off as soon as I hang up.  It's creepy and it feels like the machine is monitoring my calls, so I leave it turned off most of the time.  The machine also routes the phone calls somehow.  After half an hour on the phone with my first support call, the representative instructed me to turn the machine off.  When I did so, the call was dropped.  The phone works just fine if the machine is already off, but DO NOT SHUT IT OFF DURING A CALL.  If you do, your call will be dropped.<br /><br />And finally, this thing is just poorly designed in my opinion.<br /><br />*The user interface is not at all intuitive.<br /><br />*The machine periodically turns on by itself and seems to warm up (and use ink?) for no apparent reason and without being sent any data.<br /><br />*It also prints A LOT of reports.  It prints a report every time a fax fails.  It prints a report every time the network settings are changed.  Some of these reports are 1 line and say something like "network setup OK."  I find myself asking, why did it waste paper and ink for this?  My hours on the phone with customer support revealed that all of these are permanent settings and cannot be changed.<br /><br />*Good luck using basic driver functions.  I hate how hardware manufacturers want you to use their memory intensive junkware bundles for something as simple as printing and scanning.  Give me drivers and software that allow me to send a print job and scan when I want to, without 8 perpetual processes that slow and monitor my every click.  I'm not even sure you can scan on this thing without a mega-suite of software.<br /><br />Brother makes some great products.  We've had the same Brother sewing machine for like 10 years, and I have a Brother laser printer that I am very pleased with (except the aforementioned and ubiquitous software issues).  But the MFC-J425W is not a good Brother product.  Save yourself a headache and get something else.;;1.0;;May 11, 2012;;14;;19;;0.736842

IMO it's a piece of junk. I don't know where they get their quick times for printing, etc., but I found it slow and clunky. It takes forever to boot up, I had to turn it on manually (my older HP will "wake up" when I send a document to the printer if it's turned off), and even when it goes to print it seems like it sits and has a cup of tea while it thinks about it first. That much was annoying and frustrating (not being what I expected from the numbers in the specs), but the final straw was that the print quality was VERY poor! I print off a lot of spreadsheets and grids that my current HP handles with ease, even on "fast normal", the 7510 was skipping lines and generally faded, even on "best quality." I'm extremely disappointed with the 7510.

I spent hours researching wireless network printers and finally decided on this one. So much for research.  While the setup wasn't too bad, the printer failed to work with my primary machine (a windows7 machine). Every time I would print something, it would disconnect my PC from the wireless network.  I would have to manually disconnect and reconnect my wireless connection. I am no stranger to wireless networks or configuring routers, but 3-1/2 hours later I still had the same problem. Everything worked fine with the Macs on my network, it was just my primary machine. Not wanting to be defeated, I called Brother technical support. They immediately told me that since it worked fine with my Mac, it must be my computer and that I needed to call Microsoft, HP, or Linksys to find a solution.  I asked whether they knew of anyone else having the problem and they said no.  Odd, since after some more research, I found dozens of people with the same issue. Since Brother support refused to help (I gave them ample opportunity), I ended up returning the printer and purchasing an HP wireless printer with most of the same features (only thing missing was auto duplex printing). Needless to say, the HP printer connected flawlessly and works exactly as it should - right out of the box.  I hope someone from Brother management reads this and passes the word to their support reps that passing the buck is not acceptable. Service is King and the attitude of Brother Tech Support made a non-customer out of me. If you want a wireless printer that plays nice with both Windows7 and Mac OSx, steer clear of this printer.;;1.0;;December 23, 2011;;4;;6;;0.666667

I switched to Macintosh a year ago, and got the LaserJet 1300 several months ago. I've decided to give the printer away, and will probably replace it with the Brother 5070.<br /><br />My first gripe with the 1300 is its minimal documentation. There is also no help and the tech support information online is weak.<br /><br />My second gripe is unreliability. The printer doesn't have a display to name errors. It has three indicator lights. The printer frequently stops working, and all three lights come on. The manual says that when this happens, I should turn the printer off, leave it off for a bit, and then start up and try again. This usually does little to help. The manual also says that if this continues, I should call for tech support.<br /><br />So I called for tech support. My first call was apparently to the wrong group. The technician insisted on collecting all of my contact information at the start of the call, promising that he would give me support after we went through the full, long, contact survey. And then he did. He told me I called the wrong department and gave me the phone number for the right department. The second technician walked me through loading a new driver onto the Mac and doing a hard reset of the printer. <br /><br />The manual doesn't tell me how to do a full reset of the printer (restoring it to factory state) and I didn't realize this was going on (the tech would tell me what to do next, but not what we were doing at the more global level, maybe she didn't know) until we were fairly far along. So I still don't know how to do this, and don't know how to find out short of calling HP for support again.<br /><br />The printer worked OK for a few months, locking up occasionally but not so often that the machine was unusable. But now it's back up to its old tricks. 3 lights, printing stops, and power off only lets me get a few more pages done before I get 3 lights again. I spent several hours one night troubleshooting this, and three hours (clocked) a few nights ago troubleshooting this, and finally gave up.<br /><br />The HP web site provides no useful information, or at least none that I could find.<br /><br />The website did provide access to drivers to download. I can either download the OS X driver from September 2003 (I think I'm using that one) or I can order (and pay money for). That disk is dated April 2004. I can't tell whether the driver on the April 2004 disk is more recent than the September 2003 driver or not. I also can't tell what the driver version number is for my printer. (The About information for the printer doesn't have it and did I mention there is no help under the help menu?)<br /><br />My impression is that this is a driver problem, not a hardware problem.<br /><br />Maybe I can clean it up, for a while, with a full reset of the printer and a reload of the latest driver.<br /><br />But at some point, the time I lose is more valuable than the cost of a replacement printer. I passed the threshold a few nights ago. We've had some driver problems (I have a lab at school) with some HP multifunction printers and the Macintosh. Not as bad as the 1300, but for the first time in 20 years, I'm going to buy a laser printer that is not a Hewlett-Packard.;;1.0;;June 13, 2004;;7;;10;;0.7

I then was able to merge multiple pages into one doc using drag'n'drop in Preview, however immediately after scanning, the machine then refused to print the freshly scanned and saved document even though it was attached direct via USB. Disappointed as I was with the discovery that I wasn't going to be able to print wirelessly with my existing setup I didn't have the patience to find out whether I needed to unplug or reboot to get things going again. I'm especially disappointed given my old Canon Pixma500 which I've had for what feels like a decade would print via airport express just fine and scan through the USB cord like a trooper.

It was noisy and trashy in every way.  If you have a 1012, hang onto it for dear life!  Everyone I know comes to me for computer advice.  I'm a triple-platform guy who's done Linux, Mac, PC, and multiple versions of each.  Well, I always said, before this 1006 came out, that is was HP or nothing when it came to affordable, excellent laser printers.  No more!  I went to all the major big box stores, turns out they're forcing the 1006 on us by not having any other model in that price range in stock.  I had, up till this point, been a total starry-eyed believer in HP.  Now I'm just flabbergasted, flummoxed, confused.  Can this be real?  I'm sure younger people who might buy this might not know.  Perhaps they are so used to inferior products that they won't even get it.  But for those of us who bought the 1012, this is an unmitigated slap in the face.  It's surreal!  Please, please write HP and tell them to recall this utter pile of flimsy junk and make us a real laser jet with really long-lasting toner cartridges and solid, sturdy parts instead of the sad, paper-thin bits of fragile trash they are currently using for components in this disgraceful machine.

What motivated me to write this review is to bring into question the claim that the printer is Mac compliant.  All my photographs are in iPhoto and the software that comes with this printer (Easy-PhotoPrint EX) does not recognize the iPhoto library as being the main photo repository.  After 2 days of believing I was an idiot I wrote to Canon support to ask them for help.  They were very prompt in their reply, and told me very courteously that I wasn't an idiot .. the software can't/won't map to the iPhoto library.  I'm currently dragging photos to my desktop and having to print them from there .. quite a low tech solution methinks.  Wouldn't you have thought that some, if not the majority, of Mac users would have been using iPhoto to store their photos?  So why not have your software map to it, especially as Canon state it's Mac compliant (but not iPhoto compliant it seems).<br /><br />The other point to mention when you fire up this software is that it can take up to 3 minutes to initially "find" your desktop.  Plenty of time to make a pot of tea and take the dog for a short walk.<br /><br />Would I still have bought this printer had I known this?  I'm really not sure, the printed product is superb but  I'm still a little miffed.;;3.0;;August 9, 2009;;38;;75;;0.506667

The printing only works with Epson cartridges and they are a real headache to install.  Most of the time after you have just installed the cartridges, it states that the cartridge is not an Epson compatible cartridge - well duh - I just took it out of the Epson box.  The box contains no instalation instructions.  The printer itself has some very small line drawings on instalation, but they might as well be in hyroglyphics for being easy to understand.  I curse the day I purchased this printer.  I feel like smashing it into pieces and sending it back to Epson with a note of thanks for the junk.

First, you have to wait for it to go through all sorts of gyrations before it prints when it's been sitting for a while. Then after it prints it does the same thing again right after it prints. It moves the print head back and forth, it does some paper feeds and other such things. It's huge amount of wear and tear that doesn't have to happen. I've owned a lot of HP printers and none of them did this wasteful behavior. I don't expect this printer to last nearly as long a previous HP printers even though it's an "office" printer that should be designed for higher wear and tear.<br /><br />On previous HP printers it was easy to print normal paper and envelopes without having to change things. To print an envelope on this printer you have go through and setup for an envelope when you want to print one. Another waste of time.<br /><br />Today it ran out of black ink. We have only had this printer a few weeks and have not done that much printing. Our old HP 5100 consumer level printer lasted much longer than this per cartridge. Come on! This is suppose to be a office printer that has big cartridges that last a long time. I guess it's just smoke and mirrors from HP.<br /><br />My feeling is that HP has gone downhill a lot from what they used to be. We have owned a lot of HP printers and this printer falls way short of the old HP printer quality.;;2.0;;February 2, 2010;;4;;7;;0.571429

Epson customer service walked me through the steps of checking the printer -- they finally decided it must be defective so they had me return it for a replacement. Try boxing your old printer, driving to a FedEx center, carrying this huge heavy box out of your car... yeah, it's not fun. Plus I was without any printer for about a week. When the replacement arrives, I keep getting intermittent "Paper Jam" errors -- there was no paper jammed. Again, Epson customer service talked me through it on the phone, and decided that THE NEW PRINTER WAS ALSO DEFECTIVE. So I am going through the process of sending the 2nd printer back too. I may just sell it on Craigslist and get another brand. I cannot keep being without a printer for a week and dealing with time consuming hassles. I use this printer daily for my business, so it's not just fun and games. I need this printer in order to work.

After several E Mails during which we could not come to agreement - I decided to keep the printer, not send it back and just "eat" the lack of the toner. I then wrote a somewhat harsh review of the actions of the shipper and stated I would not purchase anything else from them.<br />Just minutes ago I received a phone call from a representative of the shipper. He explained he was the one responsible for answering the complaint I had, but he was off on Monday and had just returned and saw my Saturday E Mail. I explained I had contacted Amazon and they comped me a toner cartridge and I was satisfied and everything was now fine. He insisted on providing additional rebate due to the problems I had and is providing a $30 ticket.<br />I now feel the situation was taken care of in a most satisfactory manner and beyond what was required.

It was difficult to set up AND more importantly it takes forever to warm up and get ready to print. It goes through some dumb start up process every time you print and it takes forever. If the printer has not been used for 10 minutes, it goes through its start up process. It took me almost 25 minutes to print one stupid piece of paper this morning. What I truly hate about this printer more than anything is that, I believe, Canon has programmed the thing to make it very annoying to use ink from anyone other than Canon. Literally every time I go to print, the printer beeps and gives me an error that it cannot recognize the ink cartridges. To fix this, I simply open the case and close the case. After doing this at least 3 times every time I print, it finally prints. WTF! They have honestly gone to extreme lengths to make it so annoying that you just buy their ink. Well, guess what? I am not going to spend 3x on ink to make this printer work. There is one more really bad thing about this printer. There are two black ink bays. A large one and a small one. If either of them run out, the printer will not print. The service guy at Canon tried to make me believe that one of the black inks are used for photos and the other for printing or that they are two different black ink types. Really? He is full of crap because I never print photos and the printer used both inks. I hate this printer. I hate this printer. My entire family hates this printer. I am going to sell this printer immediately because I hate it so much and it drives me mad on a daily basis.

I spent $650 on this printer, to get rid of the headached that I had with using a separate laser pronter from an officejet that didn't scan well (couldn't adjust resolution/very slow/problematic).  Well, some issues got better and some didn't.  I scan a lot for my work.  I must say, this printer prints beautifully and very fast.  Absolutely no problems there at all.  But, if you want to scan to email, it's in jpg form.  Yuck.  If you scan into the software, everything goes smoothly until you go to save the file.  I don't care what resolution you are at, it can take several minutes.  It even continuously puts my Imac G5 to sleep and causes it to start overheating.  Isn't that strange? Nothing else has ever done this to my mac.  I've called in and talked to several people - they don't care, they say that that is just how their scanners work.  I was transferred so many times, and walked away with no solutions.  Also, being a mac user, there is a glitch (they admitted to this), in which my letter size documents will scan in as legal unless I hit auto-crop which enlarges everything on the page and crops all the way down to the actual words on the page.  It looks horrible.  But the worst thing is how it shuts my computer down and wastes so much time.  I feel I completely wasted my money.  I'll probably buy a Xerox Documate 510 on the side (we use this at work and it rarely has problems) on the side.  Don't waste your money.

One important thing to know, having just learned this from HP customer support, is that THIS PRINTER IS NOT TO BE PLUGGED INTO A SURGE PROTECTOR, OR ANY OTHER CORD OR DEVICE. It must (according to HP) be plugged DIRECTLY into the wall outlet -- not even extension cords can be used -- supposedly because it has a built in surge protector. HP says the printer will lose power input if it is not connected directly into the wall, which will lead to failure of power supply. In my case, this apparently resulted in the printer being unable to scan or make copies -- something burned out -- although it could still print from the computer.<br /><br />You would think that HP would emphasize this point in its instructions, but of course they don't. They also don't give an extra long power cord to compensate for the fact that we're not supposed to use extension cords.  Idiotic ? Yes. It's still a nice printer when it works, and of course it looks great, which is why everyone is buying it anyway. But it's a major design flaw in my opinion.;;3.0;;October 20, 2011;;5;;8;;0.625

I figured it might take a while for sofware patches to be released to allow third-party vendors to catch up with the c309a. I recently purchased a new HP Pavilion Elite computer. One would figure that the bundled software( Cyberlink LabelPrint) would work, right? Wrong. The label printed off center big time. Even on a brand-spanking-new HP computer, they don't allow their software partners to have the HP printer templates. (Cyberlink LabelPrint DOES have the Epson templates, however). I have taken this issue up the entire chain of command of HP'ssupport networks for the printer and the computer. (The computer support people refuse to talk to me, they push me off on the printer support people). CyberLink gave me a boilerplate answer too. After about a week, and sending HP support several angry emails, I got a call from a "Case Manager" at HP. He said in so many words that HP cannot give template patches to third party software vendors. As long as the labeling portion of the driver software works, HP is absolved of any responsibility for this. I went back to the store where I bought the printer last year, and they still sell new c309a printers. The packaging box shows examples of what the printer can do. One of those examples is a cd with a label on it - and the label was made with third party software - NOT the driver program label. As they are bragging that the printer prints DIRECTLY onto the cd, I would assume the disk shown on the box would NOT be an adhesive label. Here's the real issue for me - my car will only play cd's that are printed on directly. An adhesive label will increase the overall thickness of the cd so much that the cd will get stuck in the car's cd player. The quality results on a cd labeled with HP's driver set is very bad for a music cd, to the point of unusability. When every disk has the same label, with almost unreadable text (skinny white words over orange background), I'm likely to drive off the road. I chose this printer over all others because the PROMISED ability to print nice full-color music cd labels directly onto the cd was the feature I wanted. My new computer has a LightScribe drive in it, but they print in monochrome only, and also are limited in the level of creativity you can use in making a label. It also renders my 100-pack of ink-jet-printabel disks obsolete. I guess that I have to break out the Sharpie marker - it works better than the HP printer for putting graphics directly on a disk.<br />Report Inappropriate Content<br />Message 12 of 32 (5,516 Views)<br /><br />Reply<br />Marc_F<br />Visitor<br /><br />Posts: 1<br />Registered: 02-08-2010<br />0<br />Re: Photosmart C309a CD/DVD Printing Software<br />Options<br />02-08-2010 10:08 PM<br /><br />Hey Crazy_Brave, just wanted to post my 2-cents.

From the reviews, this seemed like it would be just what I needed! And I was thrilled to see it was wireless, which was on my 'wants' but not must have list.<br /><br />It was a breeze to set up, the wireless connectivity was seamless. An attractive machine and not too big. I was really happy when I got it. Unfortunately from day 1, there was an alignment issue for me. Printing on both glossy square & waterproof polyester(circle and square)labels, they never lined up properly. I had to set my image higher and to the left in order to get some semblance of centering, if I was lucky. But over two months, it got progressively worse. Now they had to be up and to the left on the top, but towards the bottom they went in the opposite direction which was when I got to the point of almost freaking out. =) I had a feeling it was feeding(manually) thru tray 1 at the slightest of angles and no matter what I did(like auto feed through tray 2, or trying different paper settings), it did not fix it. It printed the same way on regular paper. When I called HP for help, they certainly tried but in the end just blamed the label software(which I was using two completely separate ones) and the labels(56lb weight). They told me to call the label people, who also did a lot of troubleshooting patiently with me. In the end, I do think it really is the printer, because all the software I use prints fine on my ink jet. I don't know if I perhaps got a dud with an alignment issue.<br /><br />As far as print quality, though I wanted to believe it was great, I did have that small thought in the back of my head going "if I'd only spent a little more, I could've gotten better". And that's not the kind of feeling you want to have after chuckin' over a couple hundred dollars. Also, as I was cutting my labels, the ink was literally flaking off where I'd cut. I didn't know if this was related to my labels or the printer. But I just got a new laser printer after returning this one, and it's no longer happening. It'd probably be just fine for printing regular paper, but when you need something to print very precisely, it just didn't fit the bill.;;2.0;;April 6, 2011;;3;;5;;0.6

All of the descriptions of the HP sounded great.  Shipping arrived on time and the package was in good condition. Opening the package revealed the printer, the power and USB cables, software CD, and 10 pages of diagrammatic instructions.  The first few pages were simple enough: remove tape from printer and toner cartridges, turn on the power to the printer, place CD in computer's drive and choose the installation type (USB, Ethernet, or wireless).<br /><br />I bought a wireless printer, so naturally, I wanted the wireless setup. This is where things went horribly wrong.  The written instructions for wireless setup state, "Setting up wireless is as easy as inserting the CD, selecting Wireless Setup, and following the on-screen instructions."  I inserted the CD as was only given the option of 'install'.  I chose install and the message, "this may take a few minutes" and a progress bar popped up. The progress bar reached 100% and then...nothing.  Nothing else happened.  The computer was not frozen.  Just no additional options presented themselves to continue with the install.  I stopped the install, restarted my computer and the same thing happened.  I waited for 45 minutes (watching some of Lebron James' return to Cleveland) and still nothing.  I tried a few other tricks including turning off firewall and virus protection, downloading the setup from HP's support site, but still when the installer progress bar got to 100%...nothing.<br /><br />It was time for help.  I set up a chat session with HP tech service.  After two hours (!) of working with the technician, what we basically did was: run the setup program (fyi...it is the same version on the CD as the download from the HP website) let it get to 100% and then plug in the USB cable.  Once connected, my Windows 7(64bit) desktop recognized the printer and could print.  We then tried to set up the wireless aspect of the printer.  From the menu on the printer, it was simple to turn on the wireless search signal, but the next step was to push the WPS (Wi-Fi protected setup) button on the router.  I have Verizon FiOs as my ISP. I have their newest router with the latest firmware update.  My router does have a WPS button.  Unfortunately, after contacting Verizon as to why their WPS button was not working, I was informed that the button is non-functional.  The Verizon technician was not sure if the button would ever be made functional.<br /><br />According to the HP tech rep, no WPS button leaves me with no wireless option for the HP CP1525nw.  I did install the printer driver on my MacBook and again no wireless install option from the install CD. I also installed the printer driver on my Windows Vista laptop from the install CD.  With Vista, I was given the option of the type of install I would like to perform.  Since I had two other computers up and running, I chose the networked setup rather than wireless (I had wasted enough time already).  I can print from my Vista laptop.<br /><br />If you are considering making this purchase, and you desire a truly wireless printer, make sure you have a WPS button on your router that is functional.<br /><br />The install software from HP worked with Mac OS X (Snow Leopard 10.6), seemed to work well with Windows Vista but barely worked with Windows 7.<br /><br />An additional note, I did want to use the ePrint function from HP to print from an iPhone.  I did a firmware upgrade for the printer to allow HP Web Services to assign an ePrint address for the printer.  But after another chat with HP tech support, I found out that this printer and about 6 other Hp printers are not quite ready for ePrint (the public notification is at [...]).  By giving HP my email address, I will be notified when the HP LaserJet Pro CP1525nw will be ready for ePrint.<br /><br />On a positive note, the printout of the Demo page for the HP 1525 did look very nice.<br /><br />Good luck.;;1.0;;December 3, 2010;;28;;59;;0.474576

I decided to buy the 9500 Mark II instead of the Pro9000 after reading the Canon brochure a Canon rep gave me. The brochure states that the Pro9500 inks "give you archival-quality image permanence". It does not state this under the Pro9000 description so I chose the Pro9500 over the Pro9000. For a month after receiving the printer, I spent hours attempting to get this printer to print what I saw on the screens of my Canon 50D camera and of my computer. I performed tests, bought a variety of Canon papers to use, and I finally talked to Canon techs. The bottom line is this: here is nothing wrong with the printer. I was told by the Canon rep that the PIXMA Pro9500 Mark II is used to print images on canvases and matte papers and that the washed out images it printed were normal for pigment dyes. Nowhere in the brochure does it state that this printer is used specifically for artists and yet, this is what I was told by a Canon technician. Since I did not purchase my printer directly from Canon, I cannot exchange or return this printer through them even though their brochure was what persuaded me to by the Pro9500. The retailer will not honor the return because the return window expired as I spent a month trying to figure out how to make this printer do something it cannot: print out a vibrant image on Canon Platinum Pro paper. I do not recommend this printer to photographers and I am disappointed that Canon did not properly advertise the limitations and specific uses of this printer in their literature.

This is where the device falls WAY short. I LOVE the fact that it does 2-sided scanning, no other scanner in its price range does this, and it does it flawlessly, almost. I am surprised you can't see what's in my attic when doing a scan. When doing 2-sided scans, there is so much bleed-through, the scan is unusable. Meaning, you can see what is on the other side of the page you're scanning. My other AIO, which shall remain nameless, did not have this issue.<br />My other problem with this AIO is that even when I scanned less than the capacity of the ADF, the scanner or the software would crash, leaving me pissed off. I NEVER once got it to scan my 66 page, double-sided documents into a PDF. I tried this scan using the AIO printer menu controls and the AIO printer would crash shortly after scanning the last page. Tried it using the software interface and the software would crash.<br />Needless to say, I had to return it, even tho I wanted/tried to like it.;;2.0;;December 22, 2011;;4;;8;;0.5

I thought it would be an upgrade, and was excited to try out the features such as printing from an iPad as it advertises.<br /><br />To begin, this printer was not easy to setup.  Unlike the HP, you have to install the print head, plus, the inkjet cartridges.  The directions for the print head was just an illustration, and not easy to distinguish where it goes.  Instead of at the front of the printer, you have to lift up the entire unit, place it on a stand like a grand piano lid, and insert all these parts in the center of the unit.  It was so difficult to see even in a lit room, I had to get a flashlight.  The printer cartridges are also over engineered.  You have to remove a tape, then, the unit is encased in shrink-wrap, then, a big orange clip needs to be twisted off.  Silly.  I have to do this everytime I replace the 5 cartridges?  Because each cartridge "lights up" I'm thinking - I bet ink is expensive and you can't buy after-market for this printer...<br /><br />Next, the paper cartridge is very cheap.  Unlike my HP, this is a very flimsy piece of plastic.  It felt like an after-market device used for printing a CD or something.<br />After I got the paper inserted, I went to setup the Wi-Fi.  This, too, was not intuitive.  Instead of being presented with an alphabet like the HP, you have to figure out how to use the numeric keypad, and select back and forth between upper, lower, and numbers to enter the password.  The directions say to look in the troubleshooting guide, rather than simply showing how to do it.<br /><br />Although my Mac has the latest Leopard OS, it did not have this printers driver, only the MX860.  Therefore, I had to use the CD to install a bunch of software that I'll never use just to get the print driver.  It eventually worked.<br /><br />The problem is when I went to get the other computers to work on our home network.  After installing exactly like I did on my Mac, every time I went to print, the printer displaying a message "processing" forever.  It would never print.  I spent 2 hours reinstalling, turning things on and off, and it never would print.<br /><br />I ended up putting my HP back on the table next to it, reinstalled it, and it worked fine as before.  I figured out how to get the black to print (press # + 6 when turning on) because apparently this printer has a chip that doesn't print black even after replacing the cartridge if it goes dry.<br /><br />After confirming that this printer was not "iPad" compatible like the new HP (rather, you can only print using the Wi-fi with certain applications like any other Wi-fi printer), I packed this thing back up and returned.  It was all black and the buttons and interface felt very cheap when compared to the HP.  It was not a good experience and I'll stick with HP for my printer going forward.;;2.0;;March 2, 2011;;0;;5;;0.0

We're printing wirelessly from a Windows 7 desktop machine. I've experienced times of between 5 and 15 minutes per page.  In addition, many of the "apps" don't work.  Where it seems to run into trouble is when the print job contains more than a minor amount of graphics.  For example, my daughter wanted to print out coloring pages (simple black lines that form a figure that she can then color).  If the page contains one figure, and is black and white, it will print, but if the page contains 2 or more figures, the page won't print.  When the graphic had colors as well as black lines, it took over 20 minutes to finaly produce an error message.  We own 6 printers, 3 from Dell, 2 from Canon and 1 (this one) from HP.  The print quality of the HP, when it prints, is by far the worst of the 6.  We purchased this one because it is one of the few that are compatible with Apple's air print.

All of stickers were placed with an awful glue that you can't peel off. The installation software starts with a foreign language (Chinese?) that I have to guess to install. But this is just the start of a nightmare. After 2 hrs trying to set it up, it won't feed the enclosed HP photo papers - "the printer is out of paper", then when I tried with the very first piece of plain 8x11 it got jammed right in.  A screeching halt followed by a variety of tumbling noise from inside the unit.  Not only that, the machine actually shredded the paper on the way out and left inside bits of shreds. When I tried to clear them the crazy machine started moving in a sudden and literally jammed my finger.  When I tried hard to pull out my finger the glass top of the scanner cracked open.... This thing is way oversized with a tiny screen on the corner that you just can't read well. I can't believe a company capable of building aircraft engines would sell such a piece of work.

With this printer is packaged a large amount of software which is required to get the most out of the printer, especially with respect to the scanner and fax systems (which we use a lot of both). However, while the basic print driver runs ok in our environment, none of the printer / scanner software will run. Specifically, none of the software will run with any "Server" edition of any Microsoft O/S ( For Example Server 2003 ). This is not documented on the Brother web page nor on Amazon ( I checked both ). While our road warriors run XP or Vista on their laptops, all office people use terminal services to run off a central Server. No one in the office was therefore able to scan or fax.<br /><br />Despite a number of emails / phones to Brother, I received no intelligent response.<br />( I did receive one response from the registration email that said it could not answer "my concern and to please call brother").<br /><br />Finally, I felt obligated to purchase the printer from my company, and order the<br />nearly equivalent Cannon which by the way runs just as fine on the Server as it does on any laptop.<br /><br />Also, one other minor issue: the output is really too deeply recessed. Have to get the cat claws out to fetch the output. There is no lift to make this easy like on the older Brothers that are turned sideways to save space. But, duplex printing is so "cool" that I can almost overlook this minor design flaw.<br /><br />So now I have a home printer with the capability to run a print shop and am out<br />[...], and have had my office pride brusied.;;1.0;;February 15, 2010;;21;;29;;0.724138

I am a PhD student and needed to have quality access for transmitting homework to professors as needed.  Also, I am unemployed and needed to have fast and efficient turnaround on resumes and supporting documents.  I have multiple degrees and several pages of transcripts that I need to re-scan, because my previous quality was too dark.  I have not used all the features todate.  However, I do not have to stand around wondering if all the pages are faxed.  The initial noise upon turn-on is a purr compared to the other fax machine.  HP is my preferred brand for my home office and previous years I had subsitutions, because of the higher cost.  Amazon presented me with savings that I could not resist.  I am now sold on the quality and prices that Amazon delivers on my purchases.  I would highly recommend this H.P. LaserJet Pro All in One for the fax, printer, copier, and scanner.  The FAX sending is immediate; sending and saving to memory while dialing the number.  Added benefit, the pages do not jam or multiple send pages as one, because the fax also shows on display how many pages were sent.

It's not easy, but at least, and at last, I managed to get the printer to work via the USB cable.  However, for several hours, I could not get the wireless system to work at all.  It's supposed to print out its own email address for one thing, but no matter what I did, it printed out everything it's supposed to, EXCEPT for the email address.  Without that address, I couldn't send any items via the wireless system for it to print.  So then I went to the online help addresses suggested, and even though I'd just bought this printer, they won't help me because they keep telling me my warrantee has expired.  Except that was for an old HP model, etc., etc..  So whatever I tried, I've been unable to send them any questions as to how to get the email address, etc. I also tried to call HP on the one phone number for the US that I can find.1-800-474-6836.  I get put on hold forever, and finally give up.<br />I'm fairly sure this is a good item when It's properly set up, but I expect you need to get it from a dealer who will set it up for you if needed.  In any case, by the end of this day, I reloaded all the data and selected all the options in the bargain.  Then I was referred to a site that would allow me to select my own email address for the printer.  Which I did and after some more lucky jiggles I made it work.<br />At least for now.;;3.0;;May 30, 2012;;3;;5;;0.6

Two days from placement of order. As always, Amazon ordering was flawless. Item arrived without incident. Printer is a TANK heavy and awkward you will not be able to unpack this by yourself unless you have been weight lifting - lol...!!! Seriously, it's heavy 63+ pounds, huge box, lots of packing junk, lots... It is a BIG unit so unless you have a designated office or utility room where this is going don't buy it. If this is going someplace in your home in the open it won't work, trust me (white elephant). Print quality is very good, initial unpacking and hardware set up was fairly straight forward, pull something here, take something off there, usual unpacking scheme no surprises.<br /><br />Now to the BAD PART - the software set up is a --------N I G H T M A R E--------no drivers for Mac products other than a square dance on the Canon web site, find them, download them, open them, apply them, blah, blah, blah - OMG ... The user manual is absolutely the worst POS I have ever seen, completely useless. This machine literally does TO MUCH, to many functions seriously, way to many ridiculous functions that not even the most sophisticated office would ever need or use. The problem is - they are all lumped into the basic functions that one needs and wants, and where the manual fails miserably is that instead of addressing the basic functions well to help one set up, they spend all the print on these FOOLISH functions the average Joe will never use or want. Two days into setting up and I still can't get this POS to print my faxes after they are received (yup-pretty simple you would think wouldn't you) received faxes will only print from the multifunction drawer and after reading the manual I still can't figure out how to change this. I have re-set the machine twice. I am about to give up and send it back but I don't want to do this. We have wasted hours, and hours - trying to fix this problem. It was later Friday afternoon when delivered and now Saturday so CS is out of the question. I am committed to figuring this out and hope that a call to CS on Monday can fix this because the print quality is very, very good.<br /><br />I will update this review as needed. One more thing it is not just me my wife is also involved and between the two of us we can't figure this out both of us are WELL educated in our 50's and have extensive computer oriented experience both on Windows based machines and Apple products. I can only imagine what a dreadful experience it would be for a marginally trained individual.<br /><br />04/07/2012 - O.K. I have changed my review from 1 star to 4 stars and it would have gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the convoluted manual, and degree of difficulty setting up, menu system is beyond difficult. In order to get this to finally print when the faxes are received it was a matter of setting the paper setting back to the default (yup believe it or not that changed everything) when we changed the weight of the paper because we put in heavier paper the machine won't print when receiving when we changed it back (per - CS Rep) it worked fine. CS was excellent and I can't say enough about the company we purchased from and how fast their shipping was all in all a very  OVER competent product (does way more than I need but that's a good thing);;4.0;;February 25, 2012;;8;;18;;0.444444

Tech Support was exceptionally courteous and attentive, but the problems persisted until Kodak released a number of updates to the software and firmware. Now it works as expected, especially in the area of producing excellent color photo prints. Releasing products before they are fully tested is quite common in the computer industry, but I can now highly recommend the 2170 for personal and small business printing.<br /><br />6 months later:  My opinion has drastically changed and I strongly suggest avoiding the purchase of the Kodak "All In One's." Every few days it looses it's wireless connection forcing me to configure it over and over. I eventually was forced to use it via USB only. As to the claim that it uses ink economically, forget that. No matter how you set it (print color as grayscale) or a black and white item it runs out of both cartridges quickly. Investigation reveals it uses color ink even if you never print in color.

I cannot believe Kodak still sells these things. They break within months, if not DOA out of the box. And Kodak sends you a refurb (which is even worse). You can't fix a bad design - it'll fail eventually. It's everything - the paper handling and the sensors are the main problem.<br /><br />I've found the Canon MP series to be quick and reliable, with 3rd party ink here on Amazon to be on par with the price of these Kodak inks, and the prints are bette<br />r.

It sounds like something is breaking into a million pieces. So you might argue "so who cares, you only refill the paper tray every once in a while." The problem with that theory is that the sound is a clue to something-- the paper feed mechanism in these machines is prehistoric, crude, and cannot stand-up to time and whenever you have that kind of violent mechanical action in a product, you know it's poorly designed and it won't last long. So after about 5 months, my printer stopped feeding paper. After walking through the process, calling technical support, I noticed as I expected a spring had fallen-out from the contraption and there was no way to find out where it belonged, it's a mess.  Now out of the box this was not a perfect printer. Two-sided printing is known not to work well on these printers and it never worked well on mine-- it jammed frequently. One-sided printing was "OK" until this problem and now the printer is trash unless I want to hassle with a warranty process on a $100 item. Many of us may remember years ago the quality of laser printers- for example, those made by NEC would last a decade. Nowadays you have a choice of junk or junk at a low price. You can't say "hey, I'm willing to PAY for quality, just provide it." Instead, it's a low-ball market of low-ball products that flim-flam their way into your home and then fail. This is another one of those products. At $100 or so you can take your chances, but you know that in the end, you may waste your time and money. Search for quality, I am back on that search again.;;1.0;;October 22, 2009;;15;;30;;0.5

It answered my requirement for a seamless wireless printer for my home network that would support printing from either windows or mac computers as well as ipads.  Per the many reviews, installation was easy and installing on the mac, the warning not to use the included CD but to download the latest software from the HP website was a blessing.  After installing on my IMac, I successfully installed the software on a HP Windows machine and three Mac laptops and all printed successfully.<br /><br />My disappointment is with the scanning function....I will admit I may have misinterpreted the information on the top of the box "Automatic two-sided print, scan, copy, fax" to mean it would scan both sides of a document automatically.  The online HP tech suggested the statement meant it would automatically print two-sided documents but the scan, copy, fax was just one-sided.  Since it didn't say that, I asked what he could base that statement on...he simply asked if I had any more questions.  A complete waste of time dealing with an online tech who basically was providing me "CANNED" answers and really had no clue.<br /><br />So, I'm on the fence as to whether to box the thing up and ship it back and look for something else..  I was using a Canon, WHICH DOES DO DOUBLE SIDED SCANNING HP,  but it had seen better years and was starting to drop off our wireless network without explanation.  I had hoped this would be the fix, especially given the price and the size of this printer.

Set up was easy, photo print quality was wonderful.<br /><br />But: Ink consumption is high (I average a color page per day). I've replaced the cartridges twice since using the starter kit. Canon cartridges run about $50 for a full set. Second time around, I went to the local cartridge refill shop - which ran to $20 for a full set, filled to brim.<br /><br />So why am I recommending a 'Do Not Buy' this product?<br /><br />After installing the OEM cartridges, I ended up in an endless loop of 'Ink Low: Shop for Ink' or 'Cancel' printing. Clearly Canon have installed anti-competitive code to prevent customers buying OEM cartridges. Going online revealed this is a common issue with Canon printers - which is disappointing.<br /><br />Now, I would be less pissed off if this was the only Canon product I own, but it isn't. I've spent (based on daily usage and receipts) $8748.25 on Canon products over last 5 years. Beyond 5 years it's certainly more, but I don't have the receipts...<br /><br />Thankfully my printer is &lt; 12 months old and I still have the receipt. So Monday morning I'll be returning it to the store as faulty (which it is) and getting a refund. And I will no longer buy any Canon products<br /><br />In summary: Sayonara Canon Inc.;;1.0;;October 16, 2011;;0;;5;;0.0

What follows is my experience covering most of the day before finally taking a break.<br /><br />I followed the printed "Start Here" quick set-up sheet. The first steps are simply for the initial set-up and at no point is connected to a computer.<br /><br />Plugging the unit in started the process and shortly the printer software indicated set-up complete and a test page was printed with no problem.<br /><br />The printer now indicated to plug in the USB cable to the computer and then the AiO Home Center opened.<br /><br />I opened a NotePad file.  Selected, "Print". The print window did NOT list the new Kodak printer.<br /><br />Looking at the printers display which indicated "do not plug in USB cable until...", even though the software had already told me to do just that. I pressed OK on the printer, which cleared the alert but I still could not print or scan.<br /><br />Going to the Windows START menu, I selected "Printers and Faxes" the new Kodak printer was not listed. I then selected to install a new printer. I chose to install and make it the DEFAULT printer. From the Install Printer window, I chose to print a test page. The Kodak window opened and gave me the error "Software communication error Code: 105:100009)"<br /><br />I decided to restart the entire process.<br />- I disconnected the printer USB cable<br />- From Windows Control Panel I chose Add or Remove programs and deleted the Kodak software.<br />- I restarted the computer<br /><br />While the computer rebooted, I looked at the printed manual (vice the quick start), and discovered that there are two ports that fit the USB plug, (1) Ethernet, and (2) USB. I had plugged into wrong port. Why? There is a sticker on the back, aligned with the USB port, with a graphic showing a red circle/line overlaid on a graphic of a cord/plug AND there is a red tab extending over (covering) the port. This indicated to me, DO NOT USE, but actually is the correct port.<br /><br />Plugging in the USB to the "correct" port, the computer software immediately detected the printer and started loading the drivers (took about 10 minutes). When done, an alert "Printer not detected" showed up. Pressing ok, the next window indicated, "Your printer software was successfully installed."<br /><br />I chose "Finish" and the AiO Home Center opened again.<br /><br />I next checked the "Printer and Faxes" from the Control Panel... the printer was still NOT listed.<br /><br />I chose install a new printer from the Windows "Add Printer Wizard".<br /><br />When Windows indicated the software was installed, I chose to print a test page. The Kodak window opened but asked me "what FAX number do you want to send..." I canceled the print. Checking the Control Panel Printers and Faxes I discovered that the set-up had installed two printers, Kodak OH 6.1 AiO FAX and Kodak OH 6.1 AiO... and it selected the FAX as the default printer (which I quickly changed).<br /><br />I next chose to print a Notepad document with a few paragraphs of text. The made all kind of noise and actually rocked on the desktop. I heard the printer head move. On the printer the error displayed was "Printhead carriage jam". Opening the printer I found that the paper was crumpled up and jamming the printhead (I had loaded only 2 sheets in the tray).<br /><br />Clearing the jam, I pressed OK on the printer to reattempt the print job. The printer made plenty of noise but the sheet came out blank (remember it had printed a test page prior to being hooked up to the computer).<br /><br />Attempted to print the Notepad doc again. The printhead jammed and crumpled the single sheet of paper (again).<br /><br />Loading another single sheet the next attempt the page printed. The printer was VERY slow in processing and printing this single sheet of only text.<br /><br />I chose to scan a document. This went smooth and very fast.<br /><br />I printed a 5x7 photograph with excellent results.<br /><br />I next chose to "Copy" and placed a business card on the scanner glass. Two button presses activated the process. The results were a nice box of white with the text clearly displayed BUT the rest of the 8.5 x 11" paper was printed in a mid-tone gray. This was a VERY large waste of ink.<br /><br />Every time you print, a window opens letting you know that it's a Kodak printer doing the job. WHY?????? Over the years I've had plenty of printers but I never had one that insisted on reminding me what company the printer was made by every time I print.<br /><br />I went through the steps to connect the printer to the wireless router. This went fine and the printer acknowledged detecting and connecting to the router.<br /><br />Next... I was ready to attempt the set-up with my laptop using Windows 7 via Wi-Fi<br /><br />Inserting the Install Disk into the laptop, you are required to go through the registration process again (didn't see a way around it). The next thing to happen was receiving an alert, "The manifest does not exist or is corrupted (Code: 101-8197). I selected OK.<br /><br />I reran the install software and this second time it loaded fine. It then asked how I wanted to connect to the printer. I chose Wi-Fi. All attempts to connect failed. The printer was not detected. I've spent over 2 hours attempting different settings/adjustments with no success. This included going into my NETGEAR WGR614 V9 router settings.<br /><br />I haven't tested the FAX function or checked out the other options that the software allows yet. My 3 Star rating is mostly based on the install process and I anticipate upping it later (though I was not impressed by having two paper jams so soon). I'll reserve my final opinion until I've had more experience with the unit beyond the set-up (which has been quite tedious).<br />==============UPDATE REPORT BELOW as of SEPT 2012======================<br /><br />My original score was 3 Stars. Now that I've had time to "live with it" for awhile my opinion has gone down. I got my first computer/printer way back in the late 1980's and without a doubt, this has been my WORST printer.<br /><br />Wi-fi: It took less than 3 minutes (ea) to set my 2 laptops, 2 SMART phones, an iTouch, and a Wii game console to my Wi-fi, but I still can't get my printer to work with it. I just recently purchased a new "N" router and I was able to get all the same items very quickly connected... but not the Hero printer.<br /><br />Now, more importantly, this hungry monster BURNS through ink cartridges! I do very light printing, mostly simple black text, but I'm on my 3rd color cartridge (I did NOT print a single photo while using the 2nd cartridge) and already getting alerts that my 4th black cartridge is low. I'm thinking it may be cheaper to just buy a new printer than to keep Kodak in business with my ink needs.<br />=========<br />INTERESTING NOTE: The November 2012 Consumer Report Magazine, pg 33, lists the TOP 15 All-in-one inkjet printers, and NOT ONE Kodak printer is listed, least of all the Hero 6.1.<br />=========<br />On a final note, as I write this, even though the printer only has an average of 3 stars, the highest ranking "most useful" reviews are 5 stars and are the only two displayed unless you choose to see more.;;1.0;;October 30, 2011;;27;;38;;0.710526

What!?;;I don't understand how people be giving favorable reviews for this printer. Buying this printer has been the absolute worst experiences I have had with a product. After successfully using three printers on my current Mac I still haven't been able to print one print that has been even remotely successful. Printing from my Mac only lets me make print head alignments I can't print from any of the applications.<br /><br />The worst thing of is the amount of time I have spent on this. I just don't have time to keep writing tech support about my problems. I have several jobs I am working on now and I have no additional time to keep working on this. I would like to just send the printer back and get on with my life.<br /><br />UPDATE TO REVIEW:<br />I have had this printer for about a couple of months now after numerous emails to tech support and one hour plus long phone call I finally appear to be making some progress with my printer. After talking with tech support they did everything they could think of doing and then suggested that I completely wipe my hard drive and reinstall all my files. I am glad to say that so far things are beginning to look like they are working. I haven't experimented with the printer very much but after I spend some time with it I will write a new review of my findings.<br /><br />UPDATE 2<br />After having this printer for half a year and having to take it into multiple tech support shops without finding resolution I have finally got the printer to work. Part of the problem was Canon provides two drivers for this printer and tell you that both will work with this printer if you are running Mac OS 10.5. This is not the case. Apparently only the old driver will work with PowerPC Macs and only the new driver will work with Intel Macs. There is nothing on the download page that indicates this. Canon just expects you to know this without telling you. Not only did I have to guess what the right driver was to use but I had to do a clean install of my operating system to get anything to work.;;1.0;;September 7, 2009;;68;;173;;0.393064

You can install this Brother printer with a wireless network or on Macintosh but I chose the USB Interface cable on my 3GB laptop.This Brother printer will also print up to 19 pages per minute in color or black & white, has up to 600 x 2400 dpl resolution, with a 250 sheet paper tray capacity, can print from a USB flash drive,has a 25,000 sheet monthly duty cycle,and is Windows and Mac compatible. Previously I had also purchased 3 HP Digital Wireless Color printers, all of which gave me many mechanical and installation problems,but if working properly as they occasionally did, produced gorgeous high quality color prints with sharp and vivid colors,and with excellent detail most of which would be suitable for framing. HP however comes with a CD Rom that can only be used ONE TIME after which the drivers are erased off the CD Rom and you will have to go online to download any printer drivers on a different computer.The CD Rom that comes with this Brother laser printer can be used many times on different computers.I have never had any installation or maintainance problems with Brother printers whether they be inkjet or as now laser. Another positive feature about Brother printers is that they always come with a small booklet that explains everything in a down to earth easy to understand manner designed for the layman. Whether its installation or maintainance, the little booklet is invaluable.The bottom line then is if you buy a Brother Digital Color Laser Printer,the prints quality will be only marginally better than inkjet, however you should have no trouble installing it. If you buy an HP Digital Color Laser Printer there is a very high possibility you will have to return it, due to installation or mechanical problems, but if you luck out and get one that works properly, the HP digital laser color prints are infinitely better than Brother.When these toner cartridges run out of toner, I will not replace them.Instead, I will buy an HP digital laser color printer from a store near where I live, so I can easily return it if it doesnt work properly.This review is only intended for those persons that have gone past the 3rd grade.;;3.0;;July 21, 2012;;2;;6;;0.333333

I soon found out how incredibly limited this printer is. We use various large format paper sizes. Epson advertises that this printer can use "up to 13x19" paper in each tray. This is not necessarily true. The tray 2 can only print to a select set of paper sizes, so if you use one that isn't on that short list, you can't print to it. It took 2 hours on the phone for the technical support to figure this out. Their solution was just to use Tray 1 only, and change out as needed. That's right - Epson's sells 2 tray printers that can only print from one tray. And I found out that this applies to ALL of their 2-tray printers.<br /><br />I did my research before buying this printer, reading through all the restriction and limitations. No where do they disclose this limitation to their printers, and technical support will offer no solution.  This printer could be great if the 2nd paper tray wasn't so limited.<br /><br />Maybe Epson doesn't intentionally lie about the functionality of their printers, but they sure do omit relevant information.;;1.0;;February 13, 2012;;13;;38;;0.342105

This review is written for Brother as much as for the consumer.<br /><br />I actually like this printer so far. However, it has been a mixed bag for me. First, I was in charge of 100 computers and small networks in my last job before I retired. I know computers and know how to set them up. Initially I could not get this little bugger to find my computer then I had to use a USB to set it up. I actually spent the better part of an afternoon with Brother tech support. First I got the initial tech guy who took me through the same setup routine I had used. We did that several times. You know, if it doesn't work the first time do the same thing another ten times. Finally he gave me to the upper echelon tech support and we did the same drill before trying something different before finally getting it on line.<br /><br />I will say, the tech support was very good and fairly easy to tie into. No complaints at all with their tech support. They did exactly what they should do and it is good to put lower level techs as the first contact.<br /><br />Wireless should not be this hard to set up. The machine should find the network, ask for a code and be connected. What is with the USB cord. All I got to say Brother is Oh Brother.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Cheap cartridges *****This is the number one reason to buy this printer!!!!!<br />2. Nice print quality<br />3. No Jamming<br />4. Good customer support<br />5. Can place anywhere<br /><br />Cons<br />1. Number one grip is small paper capacity. If this thing handled 250 sheets I would be in love.<br />2. Paper holder is on the paper tray and needs to be pulled out and flipped up after every paper change which is frequent if you use the printer at all such as a college student might. If you forget to pull it out and flip it up the floor becomes your paper holder. This is very poor design and my number two reason for hating this printer. Again Brother. Oh Brother!!!<br />I don't want to have to mess with a paper catch every time I change paper. Put a permanent piece of plastic between the tray and the catch. It really is a no brainer.<br />3. I had a difficult set up. I think that was just bad luck obviously others have had a good experience.<br />Brother should streamline the connection.<br />4. Connects to Android and other smart phones. Thank goodness that works just the way it should for connecting.;;4.0;;May 5, 2012;;3;;5;;0.6

Yet since HP is such a big name company, I thought I would go ahead and purchase the printer anyway in hopes they would come up with a new driver that would resolve any lack of duplex printing capabilities.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when after installing the printer and software, then plugging in the a separately purchase USB A-to-B cable, it printed automatic duplexing without fail! What should be clarified is that manual duplex printing is not supported (as mentioned in HP's support site). This had nothing to do with updated software...the CD supplied with the printer contains software as old as when the printer was first packaged. (Fear not... the latest software can be found on HP's website when available.)<br /><br />All I can say is that the savings in paper (and trees) alone is worth its weight in gold! No longer are my filing cabinets of anything printed from my computer bulging with single-sided documents.<br /><br />The PostScript cabilities are great and much needed for any user that needs this type of output.<br /><br />The only issues are that there is no supplied cable. Come on HP, get with the program! And also the manual feeding. It would be nice if when paper is manually inserted into the printer, there was some sort of support to hold the it properly. Instead, the printer sucks the manually fed sheet in queue for printing and lets the sheet hang limply against the front of the printer.<br /><br />Now the HP 1210 has the right idea for manual feeding paper...it's paper stack cover acts as a tray to hold manually fed sheets for the upper input slot.<br /><br />But overall, I'm just ecstatic about the fact that duplexing is available.

However, when my last HP conked out after 6 years and me working it to death, I thought I'd try something new.  I love Canon cameras, and read the glowing reviews here for the Pixma, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Right before I made up my mind, I temporarily bought a Canon with no bells and whistles for $80 at Office Max.  I thought it performed poorly because it was cheap and on sale (perhaps that's why) -  it would print half a page and eject.  I never got a full page of printing or a full photo.  I chucked it after 3 weeks.  My HP's have performed solidly for years, and the photo quality was unbeatable. I did all my daughter's headshots on there in black and white and color, and could print 200 pages at a time quickly and efficiently for work.<br /><br />The PIXMA was not as easy to set up as the HP's, although it wasn't difficult - the user manual did not cover a lot of the questions I had for sure.  The first comment I need to make is how poorly constructed it is - sheer plastic and the there are 4 pieces that are on the sides of the machine that come pre-assembled; however, there are huge gaps between the crevices of these pieces on one side.  There is an extra piece of plastic that we have no idea what at all to do with, because it is not illustrated anywhere in the user's guide.  It is rectangular and if anyone knows where to put it, let me know.  If you are in a rush and need something printed quickly, go to Kinko's!  This machine is as slow as molasses.  You could have a heart attack waiting for something to "get ready" to print.  It takes its precious time and is loud.  Since I installed this, each and every time, it will tell me to load paper when a full ream is in there.  I've tried taking the paper out, fanning it, trying a whole new set of paper, lessening the amount of paper, increasing the paper, it makes no difference.  It will just say load paper.  The only way to get it to work, when it does, is to have only 1 sheet of paper in it.  Any more than that, the message will come on.  Forget printing photos from your computer!  It just will not do it.  I loaded the correct size photo paper in it, and no matter what we tried, it again just says "load paper." Yesterday, I took a semi-wrinkled 8x10 paper copy of a photo I needed printed for a party, and it made the copy!  This is after me trying to print it from the computer 5 times.  SO you can make a copy of a photo on the machine with the same exact paper loaded, but you cannot PRINT it or it will tell you over and over again to "load paper!"  This is totally ridiculous.  The fax option doesn't work for me.  I know you can't fax from a Mac, but I was trying to load and fax some papers directly from the machine, and it never made it.  Halfway through the alarm went off.  Again, I tried reloading the papers, made copies of them in case they were not perfect enough for the machine to read (it copied so at least that feature works on the machine!), but it would not fax.  My daughter has a MAC laptop, and it will not allow her to print from there - the LAN option doesn't work. So she has to send her work to me, and after 50 tries of the "load paper" message coming on, it will finally work with one sheet at a time loaded.  We have to constantly turn the printer on and off, and wait for it to restart.  So to print 1-2 pages can take up to 20 minutes by time you figure out just how the paper should be loaded and then wait for the machine to warm up.<br /><br />I haven't tried the scan option or trying to print photos from a camera card (I figured if it won't print photos from the computer, it probably won't print from the card; and if it did, it would probably take hours).  Just fyi, I do have the correct paper in the machine, and I worked for IBM for 15 years in the tech support group, so I'm not handicapped.  My daughter is a whiz at computers and printers (she's 15) and also is a great troubleshooter.  The one thing I haven't done yet is call canon tech support which will be my next step before hauling this out to the dumpster!  It is too late to return the printer (we only installed it 2 weeks ago, but we bought it in october.  We just didn't have time to install it, as we were dealing with some family issues).  My HP's were $200-400. Perhaps because this machine is so cheap and poorly put together it doesn't work as well?  Or could it be we got a bum machine (for which we have no recourse).<br /><br />I give it 2 thumbs down,and I'm going back to my HP when I'm in a better financial state.;;1.0;;January 25, 2011;;2;;5;;0.4

After dumping my Lexmark X7170 and Kodak ESP5 printers for various problems, I decided to try Canon b/c of the great reputation Canon has. Big mistake. First, unpacking is a bear. The instructions are broken up into 1 main manual, and multiple smaller quick-start type of instructions. These quick-start things are everywhere. Just when you think you are done, you find another taped into the most obscure places. Also, Canon puts orange tape strips on them, so that you shred the instructions taking the tape off. The good things are, that b/c this is only a printer, and not a scanner/copier/fax, it's small and lightweight. It's also less complicated to use. Once you install the software, it leads you thru the process of printing a picture in clear, concise step by step instructions. Select print, and it brings up your picture folder, than guides you thru selecting picture size, fixing problems, selecting borders, etc. Very intuitive, especially for the novice. I like that it has 2 paper trays, so you don't have to keep swapping photo and type paper. Other good things are the 5 separate ink tanks. Now, when one ink tank dries up, you only need to replace one, not the entire thing. This makes printing cheaper. There are also 2 black ink tanks, which is good b/c it's the most commonly used. This goes along w/Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow. Unfortunately, the tanks are chipped, which means you can't use any sort of generic tank, only Canon. The printer ships w/some 4x6 photo paper, and that's it. You will need a USB cable b/c it's not included.  The cheap price also means no lcd screen, so it's tougher to set-up, and diagnose etc. There are 2 buttons on the front, a power button, and another button that I have no idea what it does. Nowhere in the manual or anywhere else, is this explained. Pushing it does seemingly nothing. What it does do, is indicate why this printer gets 1 star. It was doa. I got the software loaded, the printer set-up, and everything else done. After doing this, the button started flashing orange. I assumed(correctly) that it was an error button. But, w/no lcd screen to tell me what's wrong, I had to look up in the manual. The manual tells you to count the flashes, and that's your error message. This isn't available w/the included software as far as I could see, so don't lose the manual! Anyway, I counted 12 flashes. Problem, no listing of 12 flashes in the manual! It jumped from 9 to 13. I had to try and print a picture, so that it would tell me what was wrong. When I did, it gave me the error message of 6a80(google it, it seems to be common for Canon printers). It suggested I turn off, and restart the printer. If that doesn't work, consult the (useless) manual. After I googled the code, I discovered it was from 12 flashes(again, not in the manual, and it points to a defective print-head. I noticed the print head was not returning to it's position in the printer. Nothing I tried worked, the head just stayed in the center, and refused to return to the right. There is no quick fix to this from what I could find online. Since I am not about to buy a new printhead for a brand new printer, I will be returning this asap. Now I have to figure out another printer brand I haven't tried yet.;;1.0;;July 4, 2009;;15;;21;;0.714286

Gulps down ink.;;It never occurred to me to think of a printer in terms of noise. The office comes to a stop when this thing goes to work. Not only is it LOUD when it prints, but after each printing it spends another 20 seconds resetting something inside and that task is LOUD. My desk is about 10 feet away and if the phone rings, I have to cancel the print job before answering the phone. The first time I used it, a guy came over from an adjoining office to ask, "What is going on in here?". It's hard to believe HP would allow such an obnoxious device go to market. I got the printer for "free" when I bought a computer so I guess I can't complain too much. If I had actually purchased it, it would have been returned the very same day.<br /><br />I called HP to see if this was normal. After well over 30 minutes on hold in a customer "support" phone tree I hung up. I'd have given this 2 stars (it is reasonably fast and prints well) but the lack of support drops it down to one star - even lower if there was the option.<br /><br />This printer uses 25% more ink than our Deskjet (also from HP - I'd give it a 5 star rating).

I got the printer and after unpacking it, and looking everywhere in the manual to figure out how to install the printer with my Mac Mine, I could find absolutely zero information. Then I looked on the box to see if it even said anything about the Mac compatibility. On the box, once again there was the Mac OS symbol and next to it in small print it directed me to Canon USA for a driver. After finding a driver, I downloaded the driver and installed it. The instructions that came with the driver then sent me on a chase to find how to add the printer from system preferences on the Mac. After spending nearly two hours and something that should hopefully take no more than 10 minutes and being extremely frustrated, THE PRINTER IS GOING BACK. Save yourself frustration and do not buy this printer if you have a Mac. Now in all fairness, I did not call customer support, but really......is it really that hard to put all the necessary information on the disc that comes with the printer and setup some auto install function.;;1.0;;September 18, 2011;;5;;13;;0.384615

Case in point is their HP 1012 laser printer that came out over 7 years ago.<br /><br />The HP 1012 was the first laser printer that was designed with a very small footprint, and yet provided great laser printing compared to other models costing hundreds of dollars more.<br /><br />When Vista came out in 2007, and consumers realized that there would be no update for the HP 1012 drivers, thousands of consumers complained about HP's lack of interest in simply updating the drivers for the HP 1012 model. Consumers complaints were not being addressed, and so, HP decided, for no explainable reason, not to provide an updated driver for the HP 1012. This left with consumers having to dispose of a good functioning laser printer and to fork out money for a new one -- a move that HP hoped to add more profits to their coffers.<br /><br />While this review isn't particularly relative to this model, I wanted to warn consumers of this trend that HP practices.<br /><br />I still have my HP 1012 sitting in my closet.  I only buy from Brother or Samsung now.<br /><br />Update: 03-27-2011:<br /><br />While doing additional research online, I found a proven method for my HP LaserJet 1012 FINALLY(!!!) to work with Windows 7 Professional x64.<br /><br />I read that using the drivers for HP LaserJet 3055 will work.  The only thing required is that you have to force your printer to use the DOT4 port.  Here's how:<br /><br />1.  In Windows 7, open Device and Printers.<br />2.  If your old printer is shown, click on the printer, then click on Remove Device.<br />3.  Click on Add Printer.<br />4.  You'll be ask "What Printer Do You Want to Install".<br />5.  Click on Add Local Printer.<br />6.  In the Use Existing Port, use the drop down menu and click on DOT4_001 Generic IEEE 1284.4, then click Next.<br />7.  Go down the list of manufactures, click on HP, then on the right under Printers, find HP LaserJet 3055 PCL 5.<br />8.  Don't bother selecting the option as a network printer.  Just get the driver installed, and print the test page.<br />9.  You can rename your printer later. Save the printer test page in your file drawer in case you have to come back to determine the drivers and printer name for networking.<br />10.

True to form, the shipment arrived on time and as described.<br /><br />I hooked it up and Windows 7 immediately recognized the printer and I was up and ready to print. I bought this printer for two reasons: I need a color laser printer, and also need to do light scanning, maybe 60 pages a week. I didn't want to shell out another $500-$750 for a dedicated sheet-fed scanner. This multi-function printer seemed to fill the bill.<br /><br />I followed the installation instructions, inserted the CD and followed the onscreen directions. Everything installed, or so it seemed. I was able to get the scanner to make exactly one scan, as a bmp. I tried several times, but couldn't get it to work with Acrobat. Acrobat wouldn't recognize the unit no matter what I did. I figured it was just a matter of tweaking a setting here and there, but suddenly the scanner just quit working. I couldn't get anything to recognize it, and even re-installed the software thinking maybe a file was missing, or corrupted. Nope. The final cut was when the printer went into sleep mode, and wouldn't wake up without being switched off and unplugged.<br /><br />The included software disc comes with several programs, including a free version of Adobe Acrobat 9. However, the installation routine never asks you if you want to install anything individually, it just asks if you want to continue installing the Brother software. I forgot that the unit ships with a free version of Acrobat 9, because I already own it. This damned thing installed its own version of Acrobat 9 over mine without any warning. I had to uninstall their version, reinstall my Adobe download and go find the serial numbers of Acrobat 9 as well as Acrobat 6, the version I upgraded from. Thanks, Brother, but some people actually already own certain programs and it's not an upgrade to use an OEM licensed product over the one they already paid for (and customized - that also pissed me off - I lost the settings and everything else that I'd already set up in Acrobat). The scanner software that comes with the unit is PaperPort, which is a kludge I've had to deal with before, and a couple of other minor league programs not worth mentioning. Scanning software seems to be one area of computing that doesn't really work that well, but I generally scan to directly to Acrobat, bypassing that problem. There was a control panel-type software program that allowed the user to access all the setup screens so one doesn't have to stand in front of the printer for an hour setting it up.<br /><br />If you really need a multifunction printer, this one might be okay if you get a unit that works and skip the software as much as possible. I know, defective units happen, but it's frustrating to get one nonetheless. Had it not been for the software hassle, I might have asked for an exchange, but the software suite is so bad I just didn't ever want to see the name Brother on anything I own.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about Amazon - they immediately took the return, scheduled the pickup and the unit was on its way back to Amazon within 24 hours.;;1.0;;March 25, 2011;;14;;27;;0.518519

LEXMARK TECHNICAL SUPPORT, dont waste your time,and even more concerning to me is after I called them, they ignored and wouldnt even discuss the error I was telling them was showing up. I talked to two different technicians and they both wanted me to let them remote control my computer from their end. Oh ya by the way. one was in India , who I had to quit talking to because I could not understand anything he was saying, and the other was in the Phillipines. I highly recomend you do not trust them on your computer. Neither one of them solved anything with my printer. The person in the Phillipines kept telling me he was waiting to get on while the window on my screen told me he was on my computer, and working. Then he requested me to let him on my desktop office computer, and I told him no, I was getting very suspicious by this time. I would basically say that Lexmark has NO technical support.

I got the first new Canon MP 990 last week.  I carefully unpacked and set the printer on a good surface for set up.  I followed the simple-looking directions with plenty of time set aside for this task.<br /><br />Problem:  Canon ships this printer with the print head separate - expecting anyone (about whom they know nothing) to finish assembling the printer for them.  Following the diagram (one panel easily read & understood),  I inserted the print head oriented per the illustration: the print head went partially into place in the print head carrier and STUCK without seating to the bottom of the carrier.  This means that the print head remains too high to install the ink cartridges.  And - when you turn off power, the carrier attempts to return to the "home position" - jamming against the side of the cover under which it is supposed to be positioned. - The the print head lock lever cannot be lowered to permit this action to complete.<br /><br />Called Canon Support and we spent 20 minutes trying all suggestions (to either seat the head completely or extract it for another try).  The print head wouldn't budge.  Finally, I was told to FORCE the lock lever down so that the printer top could be closed and readied for return.  I was told: We will send a refurbished MP 990 with the print head installed.  (Which they should have done with all these printers in the first place.)<br /><br />The replacement printer arrived yesterday (6/02/2010).  I waited until I had ample time in the evening and: proceeded exactly as I did the first time with set up.  When I opened the front tray: I immediately saw the print head in its sealed package, just like the original new printer!  Canon seems not to understand the term, " factory installed."<br /><br />So naturally: I again attempted to do this print head installation and again it jammed and cannot be moved.  I now have TWO useless Canon Pixma PM 990 printers sitting here taking up space.  I will have to pack both up and find a way to return them - I'm not set up as a "shipping department."<br /><br />I did a lot of searching before buying this printer.  I got 'fooled' because I thought Canon might be as good a making printers as they are at making cameras.  This is evidently not true.  I am angry and very disappointed.;;1.0;;June 2, 2010;;10;;28;;0.357143

Reading Brett Oyler's review ("HP has pulled 1022 driver from Website") was not warm-fuzzies making, so I went to the HP website.  (Google on "hewlett packard support printer") Enter lj 1022, and you get taken to a page where you can choose drivers for several operating systems.  For various stripes of Windows, you can download the drivers and software directly.  For Mac OS X, you have to order a CD -- you get taken to a CD Rom Ordering Page, for a generic "HP LaserJet 1020/1022 series printing software CD".  It costs $10 plus shipping.  And it's not even clear this has the Mac drivers ... wouldn't this be the same disc included with the printers, including the 1020?  Well, I'm sure sufficient cleverness can turn up the 1022 Mac driver, but why does HP have to make it such a PITA.<br /><br />Overall, I'm unimpressed with the new model 1020 compared with the 1012.  The significant differences seem to be the opposite of improvements --<br /><br />-- USB 2, versus 1.1?  for most use does this really increase pages per minute?  or is it just that the old tech is not available any more?<br /><br />-- lack of Mac connectivity<br /><br />-- they've removed the useful Cancel and Go buttons!  Perhaps, if you have installed the HP bloatware, as opposed to the simple drivers, you can mouse around to acomplish the same tasks (meanwhile another 5 pages of that print job you want to cancel pop out).  I know this makes it cheaper to make, but they've also increased the price. Hmm.<br /><br />-- if there's even a minor improvement in the print quality, I haven't seen any mention of that in any review or promotional material.  (I wanted to print a test page for the 1020, but .. well, gee, what happened to the Go button which did that?)<br /><br />So, I'm wondering if I want to get a 1020 for myself, and give the 1012 to my sister .... and all I can think is do I love her enough to take what seems to be a downgrade for myself?;;3.0;;May 23, 2006;;8;;11;;0.727273

New never opened box arrived.  It is a big printer physically.  Put it across the room from computer using a long cord connnector.  Already had Pixma iP4000 which printed nice 8.5x11".  Difference in quality obvious.  Will be using Canon Classic II gloss paper.  When ink gets low I will refill for a fraction of Canon ink.  There are high end ink suppliers on the web with instructions.<br /><br />  Been using Elements 7.  Bought a new computer and decided to try Google Picasa3 which is free.  So far I like it better than Elements 7 on last computer.  May not download to new computer Picasa3 is so simple to use.  Easy editing and printing to the 9000MkII.  Want to mention I bought the Iomega 1TB portable HD which I used to transfer thousands of pics from old to new computer.  New computer has Windows 7.  Like it generally.  Easier with digital pics for me than Windows XP.<br /><br />  Need to mention cameras because they effect print quality.  Lots of my files have pics from my Canon SX10 IS.  A year ago I bought the Canon 40D and five lens mostly on Ebay.  Three of the lens are "L" type which are among the best IMHO.  Two are one step down but still excellent the 50MM 1.4 and 10 to 22mm 3.5 both by Canon.  Also read some popular books on photography by Peterson and Scott Kelby.  Among the helpful ideas they taught me was the use of a tripod or monopod for ALL pics if possible.  Canon Pro9000MkII prints are much better from 40D pics even through each original pics has close to same megapixals, 8mp verses 10.<br /><br />  Cameras share some attributes with astro telescopes.  In fact digital photos started with telescopes.  Telescopes have a much harder time getting good pictures due to low light, extreme distance, and earth rotation, etc.  To overcome these difficulties "good" telescope pictures require STEADY MOUNTS (i.e. tripod) and good glass (like Legacy).<br /><br />  Everyday digital camera pics can be hand held without a tripod and one unchangeable fixed or zoom lens.  BUT if you want to go to the NEXT LEVEL.  Get a good tripod with a good ballhead and put a good camera on it that uses superior glass.  Superior glass starts around $500 (prime lens) and for the zooms about $1000 and go higher.  One of them most popular Canon L glass zooms is $1600.  With the Canon 40D or current 50D at around $1200.  This next level is expensive.<br /><br />  Taken pictures all my life and studied the technicals about exposures etc.  Higher end digital cameras like the changeable lens Canons and Nikons cost upwards of $750 with QUALITY lens have many features that are not easy to use without some serious effort to learn how.  Perhaps many just use the "AUTO" settings.  Fine for them.  If your do your homework, I needed a couple supplimental instructions manuals for my Canon 40D, you can begin taking pics that allow cropping and large prints with amazing clarity.  Often one manual unclear but with the second manual comparisons learned about hundreds of options that can be programmed into camera for specific types of photography, ref: mirror lockup, white balance, full program, live view, etc.  Different lens allow specific pics advantages.  Peterson's books excellent on this.<br /><br />  Photo editors like Picasa3 make it pretty easy to take medium quality pics and crop to gems within.  Try all the tools back and forth to see what looks more pleasing.  Perhaps ONE PERCENT of original pics are perfect as taken.  The other ninety nine percent can be improved with editing, IMHO.  All the equipment described above will give you original pics of such high quality there is plenty of room for editing.  Proof me for is the difference between pics from the Canon SX10 IS and the Canon 40D with the Legacy lens and this Canon Pixma Pro9000Mk II.<br /><br />  Every time you move a digital pic in your computer you will loose some detail.  When you take the pic and store it on you computer you already have lost quite a bit unless you use RAW format.  All those megs used for each pics which the cameras advertise can be misleading if you fail to realize how reduced the pics are when you transfer off the original camera storage card and then move to digital processors and CROP and edit etc. Pro9000MkII prints with such sharpness that you need all the quality in the original you can manage.<br /><br />  If you take quality pics and edit well the Pro9000MkII will give you some prints that made me appreciate why taking the pics about half the process of creating beautiful pictures.  The other half is making large beautiful prints you hang on your walls for years of enjoyment.  My friends have been "WOW'd" by the prints from this Pro9000MkII.  I have been offered hundreds to take some pet pictures for friends and print them based on some pics of our Golden Retriever "ARROW".<br /><br />  Take good pictures and this Canon Pixma Pro9000MkII will bring back the moments they were taken plus some WOW!<br /><br />  UP DATE:  Lots of bueatiful prints later couple ink cartridges running out.  Using a refill system with chip resetter.  So easy if I have to fill one I top off any others that are low even if they have not shown refill blinking light.  No clogging problems.  Giving lots of pics to friends taken at get togethers.  Good practice photography and they really like the super quality.  This printer is the other half of a quality digital camera for someone who wants large and small quality prints.;;5.0;;May 25, 2010;;3;;21;;0.142857

EVER! But this printer is giving me such a hard time that I am going to sell it or break it with a brick. What was HP thinking when they decided to go with two trays? I bet they didn't think much about it and thus all the troubles. On top of the that, HP support is a piece of (excuse my french). First, my computer couldn't talk to the built-in scanner. I spent hours with HP support with no result. I finally did a clean install of windows 7 and fixed that problem. Then came the predicament of trays. Here's the problem:<br /><br />1. I can't put photo paper or envelops in tray 2. They have to be in tray 1.<br />2. I put envelopes in tray 1 and plain papers in tray 2. So far so good<br />3. I changed my printer preferences on my computer to select paper from tray 2 by default.<br />4. Then came the fun part. I had to make copy of a receipt. When I did that, the printer selected an envelope from the tray 1 and printed the receipt on that.<br />5. I checked the printer preferences menu on the printer screen and the default tray was tray 1. I thought it was my bad and I changed that to tray 2.<br />6. But no matter what I did, the printer kept picking up envelopes from tray 1, even when the tray 2 was selected AND locked as the default tray.<br />7. Nothing seems to fix the problem. Turning off/on printer, with/without tray 2 etc.<br /><br />Other than this design flaw, ADF, duplex scanning and printing is great. That's why the two stars.<br /><br />I have always been an HP person (for printers) but now I think it's time to look elsewhere. I have been using an HP photosmart for a couple years. Beautiful printer. It never gave me any trouble. However, it does't have ADF or duplex scanning/copying. That was the whole reason of buying this new printer but alas! Bad choice!;;2.0;;January 2, 2012;;5;;9;;0.555556

It is far from a plug in and simple software install and setup.

You may think you want to work on getting this purportedly great product to perform for you, but you have only 30 days to do that under their policy, and you will be sorry if you don't act timely.  We have 3 Macs on a home network, and the printer is basically taking up space at this point.

What a God-Send!;;After 5 years of searching and 5 different printers, I finally found the "gem" I needed.  I purchased this printer in March 2011, so I have now used it for 1 YEAR and 3 MONTHS without a hitch.  I have an online business and use the printer for scanning (200+ photos a day) and printing various size papers and envelopes (up to 200 pages a day).  Never used the fax.  I use it with a Dell PC and Windows 7.  With that background, let me give some comments based on experience...<br /><br />THE GOOD STUFF...<br /><br />... I love the wireless feature!  We have multiple computers and can print from any of them throughout the house without running wires all over the place.<br /><br />... I buy the XXL CARTRIDGES and they LAST A LONG TIME.  Remember, I print up to 200 pages a day (I would guess 80% black, the rest in color), and I have only had to replace my black cartridge 3 times in the past 15 months.  Cartridges are easy to install and although I liked the single full-color cartridge of the HP, I have come to appreciate only having to replace a single color at a time (yellow, blue, or red).  Since I used alot of blue, I've replaced that one 3 times, but the others only twice.  Brother gives you the option of purchasing the color cartridges in a group of 3 or singly.  Nice thing about shopping for brother cartridges... you don't have to wade through 20 different model numbers like the HP!<br /><br />... I can count on one hand how many times this workhorse has jammed.  And those FEW JAMS were very easy to remedy.  The printer itself "walks" you through what you need to do.<br /><br />... I LOVE that this printer will scan and print up to LEDGER SIZE pages!  It will scan 2 full 8 1/2" x 11" pages at a time, which saves me a lot of time.  (A bonus, not related to my business, is that I can scan/copy 12" x 12" Memory Book pages so all my kids can have copies!).  Granted, when it comes to printing, you can only feed one 11" x 17" paper at a time (through the back), but it's awesome if you need larger-size results!  The "touchy" complaint another reviewer gave about feeding the printer through the back can be solved simply by practicing on a few pages until you get a "feel" for it.  I've never had a problem once I got the experience.  And the truth is EVERY printer I've ever owned has some "quirk" you have to get a "feel" for.<br /><br />... ENVELOPES print just fine for me, contrary to other complaints.  But then, I don't specify a size feature on the printer, nor use a special program.  I simply have created a template I use over and over again in MS Word and I run the envelopes through like regular paper in the front tray.  I also run half-sheets of paper through all the time without any problems.  I am so glad that I can do this without having to spend precious time configuring the printer.  Other printers I have had would reject the smaller size pages & envelopes, unless I stopped to configure the printer, which of course is what the manufacturer tells you to do.  But I like simplicity.. and in this case, I love that I can "get around" the configuring and just feed paper and envelopes through without a hassle.<br /><br />THE NOT-SO GOOD...<br /><br />... Occasionaly, the printer pulls through more than one page, but I can avoid that by fanning all new paper (on all sides) before putting in the printer.  Using a higher quality paper (rather than the cheapest you can find) has also helped, especially when it comes to colored paper.  The very fact that the printer will pull through multiple pages (up to 10!) instead of jamming like all the other printers I've owned is a bonus in my opinion.<br /><br />... Cardstock will only work through the back tray, which means you have to feed the pages one at a time.  The finished result is great, but a hassle.  I miss my old HP that would print cardstock in quantities.<br /><br />... Scanning creates a finished picture that is a bit "too yellow" for my liking.  Per others reviews, if you're looking for a printer mostly for printing photos, this one isn't it.  But then all my research brought me to the conclusion that NO printer out there is both great for printing photos AND all the the other stuff, so just get a 2nd printer that can handle high quality photographs.  Anyway, I have a wonderful photo program that only takes a few seconds to "fix" the photo color I scan.  Although I wish I could get the color I want with one step, my fix is easy.  And the advantage of scanning up to ledger size makes up for it.<br /><br />... The reminder that pops up to tell you it's time to replace your cartridges shows up way too soon (I can continue to print for a couple more weeks).  But of course, you can turn this reminder off.<br /><br />RESPONSE TO OTHER REVIEWERS NEGATIVES...<br /><br />... Although this ISN'T a negative for me, I wanted to respond to those who didn't like the fact that you have to pull out the paper tray/carriage to reload.  It's easier than a copy machine, and considering I do it at least once A DAY, there has been no visible wear on the plastic parts and it still works perfectly after all this time.  Putting the carriage back in will "move" the printer on your counter top however, and this was a tiny irritation for me initially.  But I remedied that by using velcro dots to hold it in place.  It would be nice to have 2 drawers, as others have suggested, but I didn't want to go any bigger on printer size (it already takes up twice the space of any other printer I've owned).<br /><br />... About the cartridge mechanism movement that you have to wait on before the printer starts a new order:  Other reviewers have found this irritating, but it helps to understand the other side of the coin.  The reason for the movement that makes you wait on printing, is also the reason that the cartridges last a long time.  Would you rather wait a few extra seconds or buy cartridges more often?  Knowing the advantage, makes me accept the wait time.  The Lexmark I owned was MUCH worse, and did not have the long-life cartridges to offset the cartridge movement.<br /><br />... I too was worried about the flimsy-looking extension you pull out to hold the printed papers, but it's stronger than it looks!  I've even had my 2-year-old granddaughter play with it and pull it down and it's fine.<br /><br />... Someone complained about printer quality options.  There are 4 options to choose from, verses only 3 in other brands.  "Best" isn't the best I've seen in other brands, but still very nice. Be prepared, though, to wait 4 times longer than the "Normal" option for your "Best" page.  The "Fast" option creates a true "rough draft", in other words, a really poor copy.  I use mostly "Normal", and occasionally "High" and am happy with both.<br /><br />... About the scanning time complaint... You can save time with this little trick:  Actual scanning is only the first half of the time, the rest is mechanism return time.  You can remove the page being scanned at the half-way point of the scanning process and get you other page ready by the time the printer is ready to scan again.  So it seems "fast" to me!<br /><br />A FINAL THOUGHT about my "journey" to find this printer:  I had an HP All-in-One 500 model that has lasted 10 years and which I still consider the best purchase I ever made.  Unfortunately, this printer does not work with the new 64-bit computers, even with HP's so-called "fix".  So I went shopping... first to HP because of my excellent experience.  2 different printers that only lasted 2 months each made me realize how far HP has sunk in printer quality.  Lots of research led me to purchase an Epson Workforce.  Worked perfectly for... 1 whole month.  So I took the next best reviewed suggestion and purchased a Lexmark.  Six months later and lots of frustration prompted me to actually buy an older computer that would run my old HP!  Still... I really needed a printer that would work on my new bells-and-whistle computer.  Based on only 1 review at the time of purchase, I went for this Brother machine...<br /><br />... and brother, let me tell you.  What a god-send!;;5.0;;June 3, 2012;;4;;7;;0.571429

I'm still trying to figure out which is worse - their product or their customer service...<br /><br />I bought an Epson Artisan 837 - supposedly their top unit. It printed slower than my 11 yr old HP and had very faded color. So I called Epson and spent 45 minutes on hold only to spend another 5 1/2 hours on a crackly line with a guy with a heavy accent who spoke really fast and kept telling me it is printing correctly even though he couldn't see anything it printed. I took what it printed into the Apple store and showed them. They said "definitely return it". So I tried, but even though I had the unit less than two weeks, the next guy with a heavy accent who spoke even faster (half the time was spent asking him to please repeat what he said more slowly) on another crackly line told me (after I waited half an hour on hold) that they wouldn't let me return it. They sent another unit that arrived two days later all scratched up. I called, and they said they sent a refurbished unit. I said that I didn't pay for refurbished, and I wouldn't accept refurbished.  After another half hour, I spoke to a manager and still could not get my money back and just return the unit, even though it hasn't even been three weeks yet.  It's 6 days later, I just got off the phone with the manager again - they STILL will not let me return it - is that even legal?!  I have my receipts, and I WILL get my money back if it's the last thing I do!  My next call will be to VISA.<br /><br />My last printer was HP - 11 yrs old and prints great, just slow and not wireless or e. I'm still going to get a new printer, but it will not be Epson...not now, not ever. That is no way to treat people or do business.;;1.0;;February 8, 2012;;4;;7;;0.571429

Prior to this one, had the PIXMA MP530. Loved that printer. This one, not so much.<br /><br />Ink is used really fast. From the looks of it, the printer does head cleaning at every powerup, and uses the inks to do it. At $14 / 9 ml for the color cartridges, the price for the ink is $5800 per gallon.<br /><br />In addition to that, the machine will refuse to do *anything* if a single ink tank is missing or malfunctioning (u043). No scanning or printing even if the other ink tanks are brand new. If an ink tank is empty, it will give you an error (U163). To get past this error and continue to print, you have to press and hold the Stop button for at least 5 seconds.<br /><br />If you print double-sided, the rear side is printed using color inks, even if you specified grayscale or black-and-white only in your settings. You cannot override this behavior.<br /><br />Also, the company can't be persuaded to write linux printer or scanner drivers for this item. Very frustrating. The European, Asian and Australian versions of these models have linux drivers, but not the US models. My US-based family and friends use linux, so I will be not recommending this printer or the others in this series (5120, 8120) to them.<br /><br />In all fairness, the print quality is excellent. On the other hand, the high ink usage and lack of drivers are serious drawbacks.;;1.0;;May 13, 2011;;5;;12;;0.416667

It ran out of ink very quickly and when I used alternative ink cartridge, it prints but the software for the printer is configured in such a way that my computer screen gets filled with "message" windows telling me I am out of ink (about 100 in all when I came back the next morning) which took me about an hour to close.  Is had to force shut my computer.  It seems that HP strives to create software for the printer to ensure no use of alternative ink cartridge, while there is no improvement on the printers themselves.  I was happy with my old HP inkjet printer but am regretting this new purchase tremendously.  I will throw this away and go back to Epson or Brother.

I have had this about 1 month.  From box to setup and printing on my network was about 30 minutes.  Took my time and read the directions and made sure every piece of shipping tape was removed from the printer.<br /><br />The back loading of the paper is awesome.  Don't understand the complaints about limited capacity of paper in the tray.  The HP I replaced could only hold 50 sheets and most of time jammed or would just leave tread marks on the paper and never feed it to the print heads.<br /><br />The intelligent paper is really neat, although you need to buy Kodak paper.  If you try an experiment as I did, Kodak photo paper to other consumer photo paper.  Grade of paper was similar.  The print quality from the Kodak paper to the other was really noticeable.  With the Kodak paper it knows size and density, so it prints with just the right amount of ink and dries very quickly whereas on the other paper it did not do as well.<br /><br />While you may think this is a drawback, needing to buy Kodak brand paper, I personally do not.  If you like printing photos why not get the best quality your printer has to offer.  From what I have seen, Kodak paper is not anymore expensive, but you get a better print and one that will not fade like normal ink jet printer photos.<br /><br />I don't think you can go wrong with this.  Low ink replacement cost, some office supply store offer a generic brand ($7-10 Black $14-19 Color) The XL's cost just under double.  I was paying $30 per for HP.;;5.0;;October 7, 2011;;6;;10;;0.6

I got it for a great price! I looked at the history of the seller and it appears that have provided a lot of service in the past. Well when I received my printer, there were two test pages in the machine to let me know it printed. But when we hooked it up, the ink was already extremely low and the ink cartridge would not move from the right side to the left. It was jammed. When I turned on the machine, it started clicking to indicate it was jammed. There was no way we could move it, if I would have forced it, it would have broken completely.<br />  The reason I advise anyone NOT to purchase from this SELLER is considering the cartridge was jammed and unable to be moved, this problem occurred prior to sending the product out. That is misrepresentation of the product. He tried to fool me with the test pages to let me know it worked, but in the process of printing them, he would have discovered the jam and should have fixed it, or trashed the product. Bad juju!!<br />  I decided to call HP considering I have gotten products from them in the past and they have ALWAYS worked out so well. When I told them the problem, they sent me a new CERTIFIED refurbished printer, with a new cartridge cradle and two (2) sets of inkjets!! (10 total) They were very nice on the phone and did not question the validity of my claim. I received a brand new printer within 3 business days of my call! They covered the shipping to return the items and I was given 15 days to return it before, my credit card (given for collateral) was charged. I was always so impressed with HP products and services, but now I am convinced that no matter what APPLE, MAC or anyone else brings into the future, you cannot beat a great product, 100% satisfaction guarantee policy and great customer service!!

I called customer service and the CSR talked me through a few things.

The rear tray will also not print onto cardstock, whereas my old Canon Pixma MP620 could do that with no problems.  Canon offered to have it serviced because it's under warranty but the nearest place is an hour away and it could take a few weeks for diagnostics and to get replacement parts.  I use a printer for my home business - I don't have 3 weeks to wait!  They offered to replace it with a refurbished model, but if I wanted a USED printer (which, I'm assuming had been returned to Canon because it didn't work) I would have bought one on ebay.  The Canon rep told me that since this was a newer model, they didn't have any NEW models to send me, only refurbished ones.  Well, if this is a NEW model, why do you have so many refurbished ones to send out and how is it that you don't have one more NEW model laying around?  Completely ridiculous!

After that it would do ok on speed and there were never any problems with print quality.<br />  The past tense is used in this review because for the last two months it has been completely unavailable for use because the paper feed although it makes a noise will no longer pull paper into the printer no matter how many or how few sheets are available and no matter what angle they are at.<br />  As a present this was a real turkey.;;2.0;;August 25, 2010;;3;;6;;0.5

The HP Tech Guy (Syd) told me there will NOT be one available until January 2010!!!!!<br /><br />There are no generic drivers that will work either, according to Syd. I've tried other drivers and nothing works.<br /><br />Pros: I've tried it on Windows XP and it works. It is quick, but you get an HP pop-up every time to confirm you actually want to print anything, especially from the manual feed loader. Prints are crisp. Fonts look good. It's REALLY quiet! And I mean fast from an InDesign file with a lot of Postscript art overlapping one-another.<br /><br />Cons: Constant Windos XP pop-ups wanting you to confirm you are printing something (just print the damn thing). It doesn't work with Windows 7 and drivers are not to be released by HP until January 2010. No way. No how. Syd confirmed this, so there's no doubt why this was being wholesaled (not by Amazon but by Big Box). Syd actually went on to say that no HP Laserjet will work with Win 7 right now????<br /><br />Other thoughts: C'mon HP. You've had at least nine month to develop drivers for Windows 7. It was released to business as final code in July 2009. Final Release Candidate was in June 2009. What is the Problem? Syd said Microsoft had given vendors until January 2010 as a deadline, so that's HP's deadline. I don't understand this. Fail.<br /><br />If you are running XP still, this is a functional little printer for small 8-1/2 x 11 B&W laser needs (which was why I purchased it), but I'm taking it back to Big Box (okay Best Buy) for my $99 and tax refund.<br /><br />HP you disappointed me here...;;2.0;;November 1, 2009;;3;;6;;0.5

I was talked into this, the third HP product because I switched to Mac to get away from PC because the HP TouchSmart computer was a piece of garbage. This all in one printer was offered as part of a special deal at the Apple store where it was basically free when i bought my Mac. I see why now. They can't sell them, they are so bad they can only give them away. Why?<br /><br />Wireless - Despite sitting right next to the wireless router it constantly loses the signal so every print job requires me to manually go through the wireless set up wizard and re-enter the pass code every time.<br /><br />Scanner - Does a really lousy job even compared to the other useless HP scanner/photo printer I have. My choice is either a relatively easy albeit time consuming set up to get a lousy scan or a complicated "doesn't want to work at all most of the time" process to get a good quality scan.<br /><br />Warm up - Frankly you'd think this thing was run by Windows Vista the length of time it takes to start up. I like to be environmentally conscious and turn off my peripherals when not in use, but between the time to fire it up and recode the wireless I could have monks hand copy my document faster, so I compromise by leaving it on all the time.<br /><br />Double sided printing - Never has worked.<br /><br />I think HP stands for "Hell Preferred to using these products" Don't waste your time or especially your money. As they say you get what you paid for and I'm not sure they could even pay me to use this product (or any others by HP). If I were reading this, I might suppose the reviewer was simply an idiot and this was user error. However, I have a Brother color printer and a Brother all in one fax/scanner/printer etc which work beautifully. But the all in one is black and white only so I thought I'd get an all in one in color. Fortunately I haven't given those others away yet and will probably deal with the space they take up over this useless paperweight.;;1.0;;March 30, 2011;;4;;7;;0.571429

However, it turns out this is NOT a good printer for color photos at all. It's OK if you are doing only text printing. The color photos are worse than the ones by my HP-722 it replaced -- you can go crazy adjusting the color by trial-and-error ... and use a lot of ink and photo paper. Also, there is no catch tray for the documents as they come out, and more often than not they just fall on the floor. It has problems printing envelopes, too, even the common business size. The first time I tried, it stopped like it was out of paper. I hit reset and it printed the envelope, but it didn't print straight; the text was skewed. I thought this was because it interrupted the print, but it was skewed on subsequent envelopes that weren't interrupted.<br /><br />For color photo printing I plan to take my pictures to a professional service; it's cheaper. This printer will be just for text.<br /><br />Update #1: I have recently printed an 8X10 photo, and it too came out skewed. Another problem with this printer is the same problem I've had with every hp ink-jet printer I've owned: no matter how much you try to adjust the margins, they always come out unequal.<br /><br />Update #2: Although it was designed to print on both sides of a sheet, it fails this miserably because the lousy pick-up mechanism sometimes picks up two sheets of paper. To do two-sided printing, you have to print the odd pages first and then take out all the remaining blank paper and feed the printed sheets in manually one-at-a-time. Even if you want to do one-sided, it sometimes will pick up two sheets and the print will appear part on one sheet and part on the other.;;1.0;;April 16, 2008;;7;;13;;0.538462

From my experience, Amazon is lightning-quick in exchanging defective merchandise when there's a problem, even sending the replacement before the defective one is received at its warehouse (and you're not charged, like some other websites do, for shipping it back).  But the item has to be in stock and, if it's not, you're given an estimate.  You're an adult...if the item becomes available sooner, then email Amazon about the situation and I bet you'll get it probably via expedited shipping for your troubles at no extra shipping cost.  But don't whine and moan about how bad the item is when you got an errant defective one and Amazon didn't have any in stock to immediately replace.<br /><br />As far as the printer, it is what it is.  Basic, inexpensive photo printer with the different ink cartridges (expensive to replace them all but you only have to replace what you use the most vs. an all-in-one color cartridge).  Pretty decent quality and flexibility.;;5.0;;December 8, 2007;;11;;23;;0.478261

I work from home and needed a printer fairly quickly. Based upon the advice of the Canon representative, I purchased this printer.  Needless to say, I am not happy with it.  I loved my MX700 and wanted to purchase the same thing again, however, Canon no longer makes it.  This printer is very slow in getting warmed up to start a print job.  I have had it for only two months and haven't printed a lot of documents or photos and the ink tanks are almost empty.  I will hate to see how much ink it uses when I print alot of pictures, as I sometimes do. Really hate the icons that appear on the side of desktop that get installed everytime my computer wakes up, and the door that opens up when you print, then you have to close it. Can't get the wireless connection to work and tried several times. Doesn't come with the direct hookup cable, but luckily I had saved the one from the MX700 and it was compatible. Scan is nice, which is what I use the most right now for scanning documents that I need to send to my employer.  Picture quality so far has been good, although I have only printed a few. I perfer a printer with mulitple ink cartridges, as then you only have to replace the ones that are empty and have less waste.  I am very disappointed in this printer and would not buy the same model again.  I still keep searching to buy another MX700, even knowing that it is no longer manufactured.;;3.0;;June 23, 2012;;7;;10;;0.7

I got this MX860 the other night and there are about 60 pages on how to setup one's network.  Apparently, one can not setup the network from the printer and printer screen, as they could with normal printers like Brother, HP, etc.<br />You have to start a USB connection and run an install program that runs as slow as dirt to run wireless on this printer.  This is like starting a jet by pulling it by horses.  It baffles the imagination that Canon could make this so convoluted and over-complicated.  In addition to that Canon fills up your computer with garbage.<br />It loads up about five programs into your startup tray, which bogs down your computer, and really serves no purpose at all.<br />No thanks!

Print quality is excellent, and it's remarkably quiet. Once you have it all set up, it's fine, but getting there is harder than it needs to be.<br /><br />First, like another reviewer pointed out, the manual is hopeless. You can't begin to imagine how unusable the manual is unless you've tried to read it. Truly amazingly hopeless. You can probably get by without the manual if all you want is a printer. If you need to figure out scanning or faxing, brace yourself for some frustrating reading.<br /><br />There's a little LCD screen on the printer that you use for configuration. The user interface for this is very dated, and cumbersome. I've gotten spoiled by good user interfaces over the last 5 years, so it took me by surprise to see how annoying this printer's user interface actually is. There's also a Web administration interface, and that too is clumsy and only minimally useful.<br /><br />A comparison printer is the HP Photosmart Premium C309a, slightly more expensive. The HP is beautiful and easy to use in every way that the Canon isn't. The HP has a beautiful user interface, both on the printer, and from the Web browser. The print quality from both is splendid. I think the Canon might be a bit quieter when it's printing. The styling of the Canon is more sleek, and the HP's styling is more functional. Build quality on both seems very good. The HP can print on CDs/DVDs, but the Canon can't. The HP has a cool dedicated 4x6 photo paper tray, while the Canon has a secondary rear sheet feeder that can take any size paper. I own both of these printers, and I prefer the HP C309a because it's such a pleasure to use. But the Canon MX870 is a fine printer, and I like it too.;;4.0;;September 1, 2010;;4;;6;;0.666667

If you need further assistance simply start another chat and we will be able to see the content of the previous chat session and continue to assist you.<br />4:54 PM Ed: You're kidding, right? A mail merge is where you write a Christmas card to 137 people, lay out an envelope, use the mail merge feature of, say, LibreOffice or Microsoft Word, and print 137 envelopes, each personally addressed so you can match the envelope and the recipient and do in 1 hour what might take days using the method you describe.<br />4:55 PM Yvonne: I don't use Microsoft Office, so I'm sorry but I am not familiar with it's features. The HL-2270DW was not designed primarily as an envelope printer, and where you can feed an envelope 1 at a time through the machine it would not work for large volumes of envelopes. Was there anything else I could address for you today?<br />4:57 PM Ed: A mail merge is a basic office function, not something peculiar to Microsoft software. Yes, you can. Please confirm that each time I want to print an envelope I must start with a new document and print each envelope as a separate job.<br />4:59 PM Yvonne: More then likely yes. If you already have the envelopes created within your application just open them up and print them from there. Load the envelope into the manual feed slot and open the back cover as illustrated in the link provided, then open the envelope you want to print in the application you have it in, then send it to print from there.<br />5:00 PM Ed: Wow. What is the target market for this printer? Is it designed to be used in a home office/small office?<br />5:00 PM Yvonne: Yes, just a basic small home use printer.<br />5:02 PM Ed: I'm curious how they imagine the documents we create would get to the intended destination...I suppose people working at home never need to address more than one envelope at a time. I guess I'm just not using "the machine" properly.<br />5:04 PM Yvonne: Alright, other then the envelope issue did you have any other questions I could address for you?<br />5:05 PM Ed: Nope, I think you've answered my question. I appreciate your help, Yvonne. I'll return the printer and buy something else. Thank you for your patience. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and yours!<br />5:06 PM Yvonne: You're welcome, thanks for contacting Brother, have a Merry Christmas and happy new years as well!<br />5:06 PM Notice: Yvonne exited session.<br /><br />You'll have to make up you own mind.

Yes, it does make Photo's beautifully when you finally get it done, but the "front tray" is a joke to load, taking one paper at a time and going through a number of steps to just print one photo.  Also, after putting the front cover in the "front tray" position and selecting "print from the front tray" , I often get "the printer will not print in this configuration, please return the front to the normal position" or some such garbage.<br /><br />Loading the rear tray with 4x6 photo paper never seems to get in the right place, unless I put them in front of some letter size paper, then remove the paper.<br /><br />I miss the cartridge on my old IP5000, where I could keep photo paper pre-loaded.  Also, hate the all dye based black ink that will run if it gets wet.  I don't trust addressed envelopes going out this way.

When using generic drivers there are no tools for cleaning, color correction, etc. Also the including software is not compatible with Windows 7 so you must look elsewhere to find editing / printing software.<br /><br />My unit arrived with a serious power issue that causes a house wide brown out or a tripped circuit breaker every time the unit powers up, or wakes from sleep mode. It then runs fine once it powers up. But because of this I am forced to turn off my computer before I turn on the printer every time I want to print since the brown out will cause my computer to crash.<br /><br />So if you still have the patience to get this far the printer now works and prints very well for about 250 pages on the introductory cartridges including with the printer. However after toner is replaced the once beautiful colors become ugly and dull, as well as blurry.

With the cheaper ink advertising and all, thought it would be a decent printer for the price. Wanted to use it to print photos for scrapbooking. The picture quality is HORRIBLE! Pictures came out really dark or really bright and washed out, nothing like they are supposed to look. I have been printing pictures from home for YEARS on way cheaper, "lower quality" printers, and I have never seen such poor print quality. I even printed using the "best paper" kodak makes.. the Ultra Premium Photo Paper. And if that isn't bad enough, the printer will only print direct from the internet or through the Kodak software that they send (which is really aggravating to use and SUPER slow). I called their customer support to get it fixed and they were like "Well, as you can see, it prints fine from our Kodak software." I should be able to print from other, better software. It won't even let me print direct from windows from a file through the standard print dialog box. It sends the image to the printer and spits out a blank page EVERY TIME.<br /><br />Please, save your money, get a $35 "crap" printer from wal-mart. You will STILL get better print quality.

I have the printer covered when I wasn't using it. A few months ago, I found there was a problem with the sheet feeder. I called Canon, the tech I spoke to couldn't fix the problem over the phone, so he suggested that I bring the printer to one of their authorized service stores, which I did.<br /><br />I sent the print to Barnett Business in NY. A few weeks later, the service store called me back telling me the sheet feeder has to be replaced and it cost ~$120. I said OK. A few more weeks later, they told me that the circuit board has to be replaced, and it costs about $120-$130. This time I told them "NO". If I have to spend $300 ($76 labor fee) to repair an old printer, I might as well buy a new one.<br /><br />When I got my printer back, I found that the printhead stuck on the side when I turn the power on. Before I sent the printer to the repair shop, the printhead will move to the center when I open the lid. I took the printer apart, and discovered that all my ink cartridges were either empty, near empty or half full. When I sent the printer to the repair shop, all tanks were FULL.<br /><br />This printer is my 2nd Canon printer, I own a Canon i860, One of the printhead of that printer failed in a couple of years. I also have HP & Epson printers, they all lasted longer than Canon printers.<br /><br />My advice to those who are looking to buy a printer: Avoid Canon printers.;;1.0;;December 21, 2008;;7;;29;;0.241379

The old one was so great! NEVER a problem!<br />I purchased a this model 2 months ago (HP Photosmart premium), and within a month it started malfunctioning (every 3rd page from faxes and prints didn't go through). I called tech support and spent 2 hours troubleshooting. In the end they wanted to send a refurbished product to replce it and give me the remaining 60 days from the original purchase warrenty...WTF?? I told them that they were crazy and returned it to the big box store that I bought it from (They will take things back for 90 days without any hassle).<br />I bought another HP printer (8500A and $100 more!)to replace the defective HP Photosmart Premium.I started thinking that maybe you get what you pay for, and I needed to buy the top of the line printer to get what we had in our old All-in-one. Well, here I am, 60 days later, and now THIS one is malfunctioning. It freaks out on ANY prints greater than 2 pages long and I have to wait for it to go through a 5 minute cycle to reset inself. Needless to say, I am returning it today to the same big box store and buying an Epson Artisan at another store. I am SO fed up with HP! Their quality has gone down hill in the last 5 years. I believe they have real issues with the onboard computers that are driving these printers. Be very careful or buy a really good replacement warrenty if you dare to buy this printer.

I have a laptop and I print my own photos. This wireless photo quality printer seemed like a great fit for me.  And since it also included the scanner, it takes up less space. It has faxing capabilities but I don't foresee a need. It's easy to set up and easy to use. BUT the wireless (apparently any wirless) doesn't work well if it's located too far from the router or if there is metal (refrig, stove, etc.) blocking the signal between the printer, the router or the computer. I wasn't aware. I spent over 1.25 hours on the phone with one Canon rep, with the determination that I needed to use a USB cord (no longer a "wireless" printer) or move the printer closer to the router, which wasn't an option. The 2nd Canon rep was much more helpful and quickly figured out the issue. Photos (anything) will begin to print but then stop. I had probably 20 partially printed photos/paper during the first Canon call. I also had issues with the first few photos printing with what appeared to be roller marks and every so often (maybe one out of five), I am getting photos that appear blotchy. Either too much ink or not enough. I'm going to print a few more to see if the blotchiness goes away. If not, I'll return the printer. I can't print from anywhere in the house (including from my computer stand) but I can live with that. I am unwilling to live with the poor quality photos. I'm giving it three stars because the wireless problem isn't a printer issue and I'm hoping the prints will get better.;;3.0;;December 20, 2011;;1;;5;;0.2

And there is no all encompassing single package or directions on which file to install first. It took me many hours and several attempts to install files and sort things out regarding sequence of apps to use to get the MX882 working.<br /><br />Wireless setup was a piece of cake but I had all the information at hand. I used the MX882 operator panel to setup which was confusing and slow.<br /><br />Printer:<br />Because I am wireless I had to "add printer" twice, once as a CIJNetwork printer and again as a Bonjour printer for scanner support. While the MX882 has duplex (2-sided) printing, it is disabled when you chose borderless paper, no choice. I cannot print directly using my iPhone but have to go through the Mac because the MX882 only supports Bonjour, not AirPrint. And when I print from my iPhone, no duplex though my Canon PIXIMA iP 3000 does.<br /><br />Scanner:<br />In order to make use of the ADF (automatic document feed) one has to either use the Canon software or the Image Capture app. Most apps that have scanner capability cannot see or use the MX882 because of the way Canon failed to implement.<br /><br />Over many years, I have had several Canon printers. I believe in their printing technology and overall excellence. However, the MX882, thus far, has been the worse Canon printer in terms of "plug and play" and operating system compatibility.<br /><br />If and whenever Canon implements better IOS drivers that resolves all the issues I have found, I will remove this review.;;1.0;;December 15, 2011;;2;;5;;0.4

For less than the asking price - you can have a color printer with wireless networking - so you don't have to run an ethernet cable around your house/office.<br />2. MOST IMP- HP LISTEN - EXTREMELY POOR TECH SUPPORT! - Spent hours on the phone. No help whatsoever with setting this up as a network printer. The department that deals with that is only open on weekdays and that too they are pretty clueless. When we did talk to people - there was very little interest in solving my problem. I think dell used to be awesome - then sort of became a dud like HP and now they are climbing their way out of the hole. Even if you had to pay more and had to make a choice between dell and HP - I would certainly go with dell. Strong tech support (yes I know they used to suck - but now they are back in the game again).<br /><br />Please once again, stay away from the product because it is only as good as the support behind it and in this case it really sucks.<br />On the plus side - we have printed about 10 - 15 pages so far and that has gone smoothly. I have not had a chance to use any of the bundled software so I can not comment on it.<br /><br />Hope this helps.;;1.0;;July 30, 2008;;5;;7;;0.714286

The screen would just go blank and the printer would reset itself.  That was my first experience with their customer service.  I wasted 30 minutes on the phone before giving up and figuring out that I could do it through their chat option.  Well turns out you need a USB cable to update the firmware, if only it came with one huh?  Luckily I did have an old one and their customer service was very helpful in getting the printer updated.<br />So I packed it back up (I was moving in a week) and when I went to set it up a week later the screen was going nuts.  It thought I was pushing the touch screen buttons when I was 2 inches away.  Kind of hard to enter in the WIFI password when it kept thinking I was "touching" the cancel button.  So back to customer service.  I proceeded to tell the lady my problem and she let me know that the touch screen was based off of heat and that even though I didn't touch it, it may still sense my finger.  I told her that I was unsatisfied and she agreed that 2 inches away was a problem so Kodak mailed me a replacement one free of charge.<br /><br />Well it just showed up and it was 10 times worse.  I would just look at the thing from across the room and it would beep and pop up different menus and randomly turn  itself on and off.  If i got with in six inches of it, it started printing out sample images.  Sooooo.... back to customer service.  This time I said I just wanted a refund.  Well after 2 hours of IM chatting and phone calls, I finally just hung up. Now I have to horrible printers and a horrible customer service department to deal with.<br /><br />Luckily I was able to return the original one back were I purchased it and I am sending the replacement one back to kodak.<br /><br />Never buying from Kodak again.

Used up an extra foot of USB cable so I had to rearrange everything on my desk. (Brother suggests a cable length of no more than two meters).<br />5) Print speed was nowhere near what was claimed. Four color+b&w pages took 45 seconds from start to finish.<br />6) I kept getting an installation error and failure to load the software until I turned off my antivirus program.<br /><br />The very bad:<br />1) PRINT QUALITY! It's nice to have all these extra features in an all-in-one inkjet, but the primary function should be to print, and to print well. This printer doesn't do that. Color prints had horizontal bars and striping and the color appeared washed out and weak. B&W was OK, but nothing special; not as sharp as I'd like to see.<br /><br />The minor annoyances were bearable.

This laser printer from brother was rather well recommended on Amazon, and I made the mistake of purchasing it, along with the extra paper-tray.<br /><br />On first use itself, I realized that the wireless printing option was a lost cause -- it was too unreliable.<br /><br />Within a few months, the printer lost its capacity to use the extra paper-tray. Very soon, the ethernet port went the way of the dodo too, though I first suspected problems with my router, and tried it with 2 different routers (I also have other printers on my network). And I was left with just the option of the USB port.<br /><br />And then finally, the USB port has stopped working too, so that I am stuck with a printer that does not print anymore, except test-pages.<br /><br />Considering that it has not been long since purchasing the printer, this is rather egregious: this printer has expensive consumables, so that considerable recurring profits are likely made through the drums and toners frequently needed.

Because it is wireless you can place it anywhere that you have an outlet and wi-fi.<br />-It can print on both sides of the paper<br />-Five individual ink tanks so you save ink<br />CONS:<br />-Ink jet print quality is not good enough for a professional look.  If this is for an office I recommend getting a LaserJet printer instead and connecting it to an access point with a USB port.<br />-Five individual ink tanks?  Why does it need two different sized black ink tanks?  And there is no bundle available with all five.<br />-The duplication printing looks poor as the ink tends to bleed through the paper more than a laser.<br />-Contrary to other reviews, I found the set up was complicated.  I.e. I would not expect my parents to do it.  Once it is done and working the feeling is great.<br />-It cannot work as both a wired (USB) and wireless printer.  My desktop PC was able to find the printer as a network device.<br />-Input paper tray is small for a network printer.<br />-Copying bound material is cumbersome as you need to lift the upper half of the printer to expose the flat copier.<br />-Large foot print.  It takes up more space than other multi-function printers I've used.<br />Overall, I would not recommend this printer for an office.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/2/2012<br />In response to some of the comments I must clarify that I was "upgrading" from a Cannon MF5770 multi-function mono-chrome laser printer which originally cost about the same.  I thought the wireless networking feature would be a great upgrade.  My basis was a laser product thus the comparison.  I find that I am saving documents to a flash drive and walking them over to the PC connected to the laser and printing them there.  Since all my documents have text, I prefer a gray scale laser picture over the color picture from the Cannon MX882.<br />As for how can five ink cartridges be a pro and a con.  Actually four cartridges is a pro.  Having a second black cartridge is a waste.  A genius would have designed one bigger black cartridge.  Also, you cannot buy all five in a bundle.<br />The total cost of ownership of my laser MF5770 is much less than the MX882.  One laser cartridge lasts about ten times longer than a set of ink cartridges.<br />In summary, if you have experience with a laser printer Cannon MX882 will be a disappointment.;;1.0;;May 30, 2011;;27;;71;;0.380282

I have always been an HP printer supporter from day one.  I have tried other printers but unfortunately I haven't had very good luck with the others and specifically with the Epson Printers.<br /><br />My trusted over the hill HP LaserJet 2100M which I've had since 1998 finally pooped out on me.  I tried to find an equivalent printer thinking that the P1006 is inferior compared to the 2100M, and was hesitant to buy it.  But now that I'm retired and on a limited budget, I really can't afford a very expensive printer and so I purchased the P1006 anyway.<br /><br />Well so far I've been proven wrong in my way of thinking.  This printer works admirably and prints darker and faster than my old trusted HP 2100M.  As far as the noise is concerned, it may be just a wee bit louder than the 2100M but I can't be sure.<br /><br />I used to be a PC and Software instructor for a major computer company and my printing requirements today are not as extensive as it used to be and all I need now is a solid printer that will print out a few pages of my DVD collection, email, receipts for items purchased through the internet and some occassional web pages.<br /><br />I do have two (err!!) three printers.  Two HP inkjet printers and this laser printer.  The important thing to remember with the HP printers is to NOT PLUG IN THE PRINTER CABLE AND POWER UP THE PRINTER ... PRIOR ... to installing the printer driver.  This is IMPERATIVE in most cases or you could have a ton of problems deleting the mess you've created and starting the installation over again.<br /><br />SO BE WARNED in advance as I've run into a couple of problems in the past when I was in a hurry and DID NOT install the drivers first.  VIEW THE CD FIRST as it gives SPECIFIC instructions as what to do .. like removing the Styrofoam inside the printer, a ring and a tape that covers the toner.  If you are NOT aware of these and are in a big hurry, you could ruin the printer and make it a lot harder to get things going than it needs to be.<br /><br />Other than that, enjoy what this printer has to offer.  And for as cheap as it is ... it's a wonderful buy!<br /><br />Oh YES, why it's not a 5 star?  Because it just my initial impression.  I will be back in a month and do an addendum.<br /><br />August 22, 2009 update:<br />Have run into a minor problem in that sometimes the print on the printed material rubs off due to maybe a fuser problem.  What do I mean by that?  A laser printer works similar to a copier in that there is a drum where the images and for a lack of better word are etched into.  This etched area then picks up the black toner and as it rolls on to the paper transfers the image into the paper.  Then the paper goes through a heating element which fuses the toner into the paper.<br /><br />In the olden days of the old Xerox copiers, there was something called fuser oil which helps fuse the image into the paper as it goes through the heating element.  Don't know if the printers of today requires this fuser oil or maybe it's now part of the toner particles.  I seem to have read somewhere where toner these days are a combination of black ink and plastic which is then fused into the paper?  Maybe I read wrong, but regardless, if the imaged is not fused properly into the paper, the images will either not adhere to the paper or will sometimes rub off.<br /><br />In my case it's not all of the printed copies and sometimes only part of the printed copy.  Again, in the old days of the copiers, if the fuser oil is NOT distributed evenly in all areas of the printed material, the print will have a tendency to rub off in that area ... as is what sometimes happens on my printed copies.<br /><br />The question now is whether the problem is with the PRINTER or with the PRINTER CARTRIDGE and or the toner material.  I will certainly find out when it's time to replace the cartridge.  If it ceases, then it would be a good indication that the cartridge is at fault.  Will let you all know further on an update.  Right now I still give it a 4 star.<br /><br />Addendum (7/3/2010)  OK here's the scoop and it's one of those DUH's!  It completely skipped my mind but you really shouldn't try to print on labels that are made for INKJET printers.  That's because some of them are especially coated to keep the LIQUID ink from smearing.  If the paper is not coated then it acts like a blotter and it smears.  Ink Jet printer papers are specially coated to try and avoid this.  So when you run it through a laser printer, the toner will NOT adhere as well and may even flake off.  Which is what I was running into.;;4.0;;August 1, 2009;;3;;5;;0.6

Now, I know that 99% of you are yawning right about now because nobody uses fax anymore.  However, my wife does and a couple of reviews that I read (not Amazon) said that it did.  They apparently assumed that all-in-one meant what it originally meant.  So, I bought this unit thinking I was getting my wife a pretty nice fax and printer.  Nope!  Since she only uses an iPad, scanning & e-mail is not an option.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that it doesn't do what I bought it to do, it is a very nice piece of equipment.

The CP2014 was easy to set up and it is small and its color prints are ok. That is about all the good I can say about it.  It is very slow, very noisy and the way the paper tray extends from the body of the printer is awful. When the printer spits out a page it would sometimes drop down onto the paper tray and then be sucked up by the printer and of course jam. It is just a shoddy product. I have since returned it (with a 15% restocking charge and a $46 return shipping freight charge). Do yourself a favor, go with one of the HP CP2025s (if you need a small footprint) or as I did, the HP LaserJet Pro CM1415FNW which is an all-in-one that I got for a terrific deal ($225) from my local Office Depot.

It looked like an expensive (=solid?), limited purpose machine, from a maker with a good rep for reliability and long life.<br /><br />I run a Mac under Lion OS, with a wireless network but most devices wired.<br /><br />The good news is that the machine was well packed and the instruction manuals were quite clear. Physical installation was a breeze. Contrary to some reviews, the noise didn't bother me.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />When I ran the installation disk, nothing happened. I switched from my preferred installation set-up (wired ethernet) to wired (USB) in case that would help. It did not. Undeterred, I tried to check the support website to see if there were new drivers; the website was down for at least the ninety minutes I tried. Undeterred, I called customer service. After 15 minutes on hold, I was deterred... deterred enough to send the whole kit-and-kaboodle back to Amazon.<br /><br />Called Amazon and asked for return labels and directions. No problem, but of course they had to snail mail them as I have no printer. The anchor and added laser cartridge I ordered will sit in the garage for a week until the labels come, but that's the least of my problems.<br /><br />Is it too much to ask that the installation work? that the website has back-up? that Brother would care enough to hire enough techs that I wouldn't have to wait for 15 minutes only to get no one?;;1.0;;December 8, 2011;;9;;15;;0.6

This DOES NOT copy a double sided document with one pass.  If you want to copy a set of documents with printing on front and back, you can only it one page at a time, and in two passes.  Therefore, you can't load a 10-page stack of documents and copy both sides, even on separate sheets.  You have to do them one at a time ..... big bummer.<br /><br />2.  This DOES NOT scan a double sided document with one pass.  Same thing as the copier.  Even the basic SnapScan does duplex scanning without a hitch, but not this Brother.  The machine specs do not tell you this, and I haven't seen other reviews about this, either.<br /><br />3.  You'll notice that the default settings create HUGE scan files.  I had one page of black and white print (a tax document) that was 18MB, yes, megs, for that one page.  You must change the settings to scan in black and white (default setting is color) to get the file size down.  Oh, and this setting change isn't on the machine, you have to do it through the Control Center on your PC.  So if you're planning to scan and email documents, they may very well be too big to email, even a single page.<br /><br />These factors leave me out in the cold.  I cannot recommend this machine for office use where double-sided documents are scanned or copied.;;1.0;;June 15, 2012;;9;;16;;0.5625

I just received this unit and installed it yesterday.  THe scanner and copier function do not work...only the printer does.  I called the customer service number provided with the packaging and spent 1 hour and 46 minutes on the phone with them.  Here are the highlights:<br /><br />I explain scanned image is black and has lines.<br />I am told to clean the glass with rubbing alcohol.<br />I clean the glass, problem still exists.<br />We try running through numerous diagnostics, problem still exists.<br />They say there is nothing more they can do over the phone and asks me to hold (this is asked no less than 20 times on this cal).<br />They came back on the line and told me there is 1 more thing they can try.<br />Theey asked me to clean the glass 3 to 4 more times using alcohol and a lint free cloth.<br />Ohhhhh, a lint free cloth will stop this from being a piece of CRAP?  I play along 2 more times.  Quite honestly I just pretended to clean the glass a 3rd and 4th time.<br />I am advised again there is nothing that they can do over the phone.  I am told I will need to take it to a local service center where if they determine it was their fault, they would fix it.  If they determine it is my fault, I need to pay for the repair.  Am I OK with this?<br />Really?<br /><br />REALLY?<br /><br />No, Im not ok with dragging this big a$$ machine down 3 stories, putting it in my car and driving it 15 miles away to see if somehow I broke the maching by opening it and plugging it in.  NO I AM NOT OK WITH THIS!<br /><br />"Can I please put you on hold again?"<br /><br />They come back and say they will need to exchange the machine.  I ask is it for a new machine.  They reply yes, it is for a new machine of the same model.  I say OK.  They then ask me for a credit card.  WHAT?  Yes, they want to put a hold on my credit card in case I forget to send the broken useless machine back to them.  If I don't give them a Major credit card, they may charge me an additional $50 return fee or some crap.<br /><br />I relent and give them a major credit card number.  I kind of need a printer/copier/scanner to do my work.<br /><br />"Can I please put you on hold again?"<br /><br />They come back.  "I'm sorry I am not able to offer the exchange at this time, we will have to try something else.  What type of paper are you using in the machine?"<br /><br />WHAT?  W H A T ?  W T F ?  Some jackwad overseas asks for my major credit card number under false pretenses then renigs on their offer to exchange.  I blow up and say that they are now very Suspect and I need to talk to a supervisor.  The problem is not the type of paper I am using.<br /><br />"Can I please put you on hold again?"<br /><br />A "supervisor" finally comes on.  He tells me he will honor the exchange and send me the refurbished machine.  I say that is not acceptable.  I did not buy a refurbished machine.  I bought a new machine and I expect it to be replaced with a new machine.  I was told the warranty is clear that an exchange would be for a refurbished machine.  I explained that I already asked this question and I was told specifically it would be for a New machine.  I also told him that I would just return the unit to Amazon abd buy the HP machine, then write an approriate review there as well as call the Better Business Bureau to see if they can explain why my Brother would treat me this way.<br /><br />"Can I please put you on hold?"<br /><br />They come back and tell me quite rudely that they got authoriztion to send me a New machine in exchange for the New one that I bought.  What a concept!  Imagine expecting a company to give you what you pay for.  I wonder if New home builders ever try this bait and switch.  "Oh you don't like this new home you paid for? Well we have a 50 year old, previously lived in one with new paint that will be a perfect replacement".<br /><br />My word.  Long story short.  Printer - Good.  Scanner - No Good.  Copier - No Good!

It feels cheap. Taking it out of the box, it feels pretty flimsy, and the paper tray and other moveable parts seem pretty fragile. I know I can be careful with it, so for me it's not an issue, but if you're buying this for a house with kids, you might want to think twice.<br /><br />2.) It takes a while to set itself up before printing a single sheet. It's definitely not instant printing. That being said, when it does start printing, it prints quickly. You just have to listen to 5 minutes of whirring and clicking before that happens.<br /><br />3.) I'm definitely not a newbie to computers or printers, but I never would have figured out how to set up wireless printing based on the instructions enclosed. My husband (who works in IT and deals with printers all day long) had to set it up, and even he thought it was a pain in the keister to do it.<br /><br />4.) It's shiny and black and shows every smudge and dust particle. I feel like 99% of the dust in my home ends up on or near my desk, so I question the logic of this printer finish.<br /><br />5.) The scanner software is a little clunky for my taste. I'm sure it's adequate, but if you want scanner software that allows you to do a lot to manipulate an imagine right in the software, this isn't for you. It will rotate and crop an image. Beyond that, it's easier to just export and do what you need to do in another program. Somewhat annoying.<br /><br />So with all that being said, you still get a lot of printer for the money, and the printouts do look good.

Once was the Officehero 6.1.  Kodak claims it will lower your ink cost, however when you print a black and white document, it uses color ink, too.  So, now it may be cheaper ink (and the price has gone up significantly on this ink since I bought the machine 6 or so months ago), but now you need color AND black, not just black.  Ridiculous.  The machine is constantly jamming up(the printer paper and the feeder paper).  It's not possible to reprint faxes because it doesn't have a fax memory.  I usually have to turn the machine off if I'm forced to cancel a job because it will say "canceling" for 5 minutes and never reset.  Also, if you send more than 3 pages to the printer for printing at a time, it will print everything in what I call "garbage" (that wing dings type font).  I hate this machine.  When I contacted Kodak, they basically said too bad.  I will replace the machines (both have the same faults) as soon as I can possibly afford it.

There are not many technical problems I can't fix. Getting this printer to work is one of them.<br /><br />My wife has a MacBook Pro, and would like to print wirelessly. I have configured this printer both as wired and as wireless, and although she can see it from the Mac, any attempt to print results in a "communication error" (if the printer is on the wired network) or "printer not present" or something similar if on the wireless network. I have a Samsung laser that is also wired/wireless and have no issues with that.<br /><br />This is my second one; the first one was clearly malfunctioning from the start and I sent it back.

The output (printed material) tilts ever so slightly to the right - its not 'straight' across or perfectly aligned. It appears that as the paper material goes thru the printer, its not being 'pulled' evenly by the rubber pulleys on both sides of the printer. The flaw is even more pronounced on thicker 8.5x11 paper stock. I called Brother and they recommended having the output come out of the back of the machine, instead of allowing it to go completely thru and exit the front as regular paper does. This supposedly has the envelope, etc. spend less time in the machine and impacted by the uneven rubber pulleys. Unfortunately, even with this inconvenient manual fix, the mis-alignment is the same. However, regular basic paper output from the paper tray is properly aligned. Lastly, the front tray that you pull out to add paper is very flimsy plastic....it gives the vibe that its not going to last too long.<br /><br />Oh well - you get what you pay for.;;2.0;;September 8, 2012;;3;;6;;0.5

Was in the market to buy another 8500 ePrinter for work, but decided to take a chance on this new 8600 due to the great price.  Big mistake.  I use this printer exclusively with a Macbook Pro on which I run Windows 7 through VM Fusion.  It seems to have some major issues printing on the Windows side of my computer onto the 8600 printer.  The printed pages are shifted up about an inch, so everything at the top of the page consistently gets cut off, by default it printed my logo all pixelated (I had to adjust the resolution to print decently), and I kept getting weird font not supported by this printer errors (using Arial?!?) when trying to print checks from Quickbooks (Windows).<br /><br />I called HP and chose to speak with the Windows tech support department, since the problems only happen on the Windows side.  They quickly tried to pass me off to the Mac department, but I did manage to keep them on the phone a short while (since I actually got someone in the US on the other end)  before they transferred me.  I gained nothing from that conversation anyway.  Once I got to the Mac tech support department, they blew me off even quicker, stating that I needed to call VM Ware for support.  VM Fusion has nothing to do with the problem and so why would they be able to help me?!?  So, 45 min of my time was wasted and no solutions.<br /><br />Again, I literally bought the 8500 ePrinter for home a few weeks ago and it worked perfectly out of the box on this laptop both on the Mac and Windows sides.  This 8600 was released too soon before they had all the bugs fixed.  The tech support person even admitted it on the phone.  Needless to say, I will be returning mine.  Wish I never ordered it due to the hassle and waste of my time.;;2.0;;December 6, 2011;;10;;14;;0.714286

That's why I was excited about this printer when I saw this information in the manufacturer's description on Amazon: "Don't compromise, see your layout at 100% -- print single- or two-sided design layouts, spreadsheets and drawings up to 13" x 19." I read that as having the ability to print duplex with paper sizes up to 13X17.<br /><br />But when it wouldn't print full duplex 11X17 pages from Publisher, Word, or even Textedit I called Epson support. After numerous tries to correct the problem I was moved up to third-level support who told me that no, in spite of what the specs say, the printer will not do full duplex with 11X17 B paper. It's a physical limitation, not a software problem.<br /><br />That's not a deal-breaker for most people since few people print newsletters on 11X17 paper (which gives a nice 8.5X11 page when folded). However, in my particular case it seems obvious that not only the advertising agency but the first two levels of Epson support don't know the limitations of the printer.<br /><br />Scanning was okay--the duplex scanning mode is nice--and duplex printing on 8.5X11 paper worked without problems. Wireless printing in my house was a bit erratic with occasional drops, but ethernet printing was fine.<br /><br />Still, in the end, and for my particular use, this printer is no better than my older wide-paper Epson stylus printer. Even though the ink is probably cheaper per page than an 8-ink printer I'm still trying to decide whether to eat the return shipping and send it back to Amazon.;;2.0;;June 6, 2012;;4;;6;;0.666667

I had wished for a better way to print drafts without having to spend all the ink for standard quality. There is a setting on the printer to reduce quality but it is cumbersome to adjust from one document to the next. HP simply allows you to choose draft from the print menu without going to the printer settings on the machine.<br /><br />No help online for the cartridge problem, and the service center is closed on Sundays.

The store named Best Buy claims to have a 30 return policy. I bought an HP printer from the so-called Best Buy store and I soon ran out of ink.  I also had a terrible time with the HP printer.  The HP printer had very little ink, it took forever too get the printer to start, it made a lot of noise when compared to other Brand named printers, it took a long time to print let alone shut down and it printed a test page that used up a great amount of INK without me directing it to.  The HP printer also has very little INK that comes with the HP printer and when I purchased extra regular INK cartridges I ran out very soon. I found this out with HP printers; very little INK.  If you buy a regular HP ink cartridge you are buying what I call a sample HP INK cartridge since it runs out of ink quickly.  If you think about it the HP cartridges that show 2.5 times more INK are the same size as the regular cartridges.  You then have to ask, "how much ink do they really put in the regular OVER priced HP INK cartridges"?  I considered myself cheated when I bought the regular sized cartridge.  My personal opinion is that the HP 2.5 times more INK cartridges run out after printing only about 50% more than the regular overpriced HP INK cartridges while you end up paying a lot more.<br />The only good thing about my experience with the Best Buy store is that I was able to try out the HP INK supply and the printers' performance!  I could suggest doing the same but I won't.  I will state that I wasn't shy returning the HP printer to the Best Buy store because I was not afraid of this chain store and I was not satisfied with the performance of the HP Printer.  Best Buy says you have 30 days to return the HP Printer you should have 30 days but this is a misnomer!  I tried the HP printer I bought from the Best Buy store and I didn't like its performance.  The Best Buy store states that you can return it within 30 days for a full refund if you don't like its performance.  I took the Best Buy store for their word and I returned the HP printer to the Best Buy store after 25 days of use.  The Best Buy store would not take the return without me signing a statement stating that I would not return anything I buy until after a 90-day period from the time I returned the HP Printer.  I should have told them to F off and accept my return without signing their statement.  The Best Buy store also wants a photo ID from everyone when they return something.  If the item is being charged back to your credit card then you should not have too give them any ID!  This amounts too invasion of privacy (Big Brother).  AMAZON IS THE BEST BUY!  AMAZON DOES NOT ASK FOR A PHOTO ID!<br />My opinion is that the Best Buy store is not the BEST BUY! I believe Amazon is the BEST BUY!<br />MY OPINION IS THAT Amazon does have the BEST BUY.  Amazon is not like the so-called Best Buy store.  It is my opinion that Amazon ALWAYS gives you the BEST BUY.  I will stay committed to Amazon and quit buying from the so-called Best Buy store.  Amazon has fantastic delivery, great service, in most states no tax, in most cases free shipping, extended warranties are available and Amazon will take care of any problems immediately, unlike the so-called Best Buy store!;;1.0;;August 12, 2012;;0;;8;;0.0

Sometimes it boots when I try to print, sometimes when I power on the printer, and occassionally for no apparent reason when it's just on standby. Once it wouldn't print until I unplugged & replugged the USB. Another time it wouldn't scan until I did the same.<br /><br />I've used this computer for years. The problem didn't start until I installed the printer. It doesn't happen when the printer's power is off. It happens most often when I try to print -- but sometimes it prints fine.<br /><br />The most annoying thing, though, is Brother's tech support. I called and they had me print a test page. It printed OK, so they told me the printer's working properly and I should call my computer manufacturer to get my computer fixed. They were adement that there's no such thing as an intermittent problem. If they can print one page, it's OK and there's something wrong with my computer. They didn't respond at all to the need to plug and unplug the USB.<br /><br />Maybe the printer's cheap enough so you can buy one and throw it out if it doesn't work.

I told them there are "fax" machines out there that work on voip.<br /><br />If I could slow the baud rate down to 9600 or slower it would work and is not adjustable on this model.<br /><br />Just do your research before you purchase.;;3.0;;November 2, 2011;;11;;21;;0.52381

And I LOVE photography!! but I want to spend my time shooting - not trying to fix a stupid, inferior printer.<br /><br />So here's the story:<br /><br />I've had the 1400 for more than a year. When it prints, the prints are OK. Nothing breathtaking.<br /><br />I added a continuous-feed ink system from inksupply.com because this printer eats ink. At first that seemed like a good solution to the outrageous cost of ink.<br /><br />But.... nothing but problems. Color is off, prints too dark, paper jams, needs to have constant head cleaning, etc.<br /><br />Some problems are with the ink system, I know. (constantly have to clear out air bubbles, tubes jam the mechanism etc)<br /><br />But some are clearly the printer. I gave up on the ink system and went back to cartridges. Yuk. Still getting dark prints, now I get random ink streaks. Major paper feed problems - forget using 4 by 6 or 5 by 7 matte papers. Still needs head cleaning and realignment all the time due to banding and bad colors.<br /><br />Fussy, fussy, fussy.<br /><br />In addition, the printer driver is needlessly complicated. And this thing is NOISY. Clang, bang, whir, motor hum, very annoying. I leave the room when it is doing a big print.<br /><br />I'm so sorry that I bought this, and even sorrier that I bought the ink system. I've spent so many frustrating hours dealing with it - far, far more time spent trying to make the printer work than actually printing photos.<br /><br />I have concluded that I just don't want to do my own prints. It will cost a lot more, but it will save me many hours of my precious time.;;1.0;;July 30, 2009;;4;;7;;0.571429

After printing, the fan immediately slows to a lower speed but runs for 15-minutes until it finally goes to sleep (as long as nothing else is printed). This low-level noise is bothersome if the printer sits right next to the computer. 2) you must choose between wired or wireless setup; the printer will not accommodate both. Maybe that's the way all wireless printers work, but I have wired and wireless machines on the network and would prefer multiple ways to print.

However, I can excuse them for the delay, because of the snow storm during that period, the week of January 23 through January 29. The box arrived with one side  damaged. I had been without a printer for about one month, and I was desperate. The UPS guy was also gone before I detected the huge damage to the side of the box. The foam used to support the contents were broken, an indication that the machine might have been damaged. I was behind in my work, so I decided to try out the machine anyway.<br /><br />The set up was not too difficult. Frankly, I couldn't connect it to my router, even with the assistance of my son on the telephone. I am temporary using a USB cable till the arrival of my son from college in March during the Spring break. I am certain the wireless feature will work, the truth, I am not electronically or computer savvy. I am so far satisfied with the features I have tried out, printing, faxing, copying etc.<br /><br />The  negative aspects are: (1) The hassle of opening the back of the machine to pull down two levers, close the back cover, and go back to push the levers down to their old positions each time you need to print on envelopes. Why such a design in this advanced technological age? (2) I cannot print double sided, the manual seems silent on that feature, an indication that the machine lacks double printing feature.<br /><br />I cannot comment on how economical or expensive the toners are, I haven't emptied up a toner yet.<br />Please, with the next model, provide double printing feature, and improve on the technology for envelope printing, and you may have an excellent product.;;4.0;;February 22, 2011;;5;;16;;0.3125

I found the design sleek and appealing, and the features listed on the box seemed pretty spiffy to me (I'm new to wireless printing, and my previous printer was from 2005).<br /><br />This thing worked perfectly fine in the first few months of use.  I purchased it with the intent of using it as my own production machine for graphic design and promo materials for my band, and it handled it alright at first, albeit being very slow to start with a print job.<br /><br />Four months after purchase, the wireless functionality is sketchy at best.  I have had no luck getting it back onto my home network, despite the fact I have made NO changes to the settings on my router, firewalls, or the WLAN settings in the printer itself.  There is no explanation for why the printer thinks it is connection, yet my broadband status menu on the router's settings page shows it as being offline and inactive.<br /><br />I am more than peeved with this situation.  I was expecting this printer to be a reliable workhorse for school and promotional use, but now I am left with a glorified, shiny paperweight.  Do not buy this product, the support is nonexistent and even the menus on the printer itself are written in what appears to be poorly translated English.  No way to find out why your printer won't communicate with your network or your pc- requires hours of troubleshooting.<br /><br />Not worth it at all.

If you, like I, placed the printer in your wish list early in July when it was a wireless printer and then ordered it from the wish list, you might not like the non-wireless printer you received. This review is meant to alert purchasers to this potential unhappiness.<br /><br />The item I bought was described as Wireless. It isn't. The phrase "print wirelessly from your mobile device" is accurate if your mobile device is an Apple product. The printer is Airprint enabled. But it IS NOT a wireless printer in any sense of the words. Brother's own website description of the printer leads one to infer that the printer is wireless.<br /><br />I like the printer and had intended on using it as a (wired) ethernet device, anyway, but Amazon really goofed on this one.<br /><br />They have now changed the description. There were, before the first wek of August, numerous offerings of this printer on the internet which stated that it was "wireless".<br /><br />The printer has thrown no circuit breakers.<br />It prints fast and with a perfect image.<br />I have no problem recommending it to anyone who wants a WIRED<br />network printer.<br /><br />It is perhaps a little flimsier feeling than I like.<br /><br />I rate it 5 stars on quality and ONE star on description and from sheer anger. I also bought it at a much lower price.;;3.0;;August 7, 2012;;10;;18;;0.555556

Really? I would love a follow-up from Canon explaining that one to me because this is not a policy that would win Canon the hearts and minds of those who buy and use their products, not to mention prospective customers.<br /><br />Amazon, on the other hand, the company I purchased this printer from, responded immediately to my situation, offering me the (far easier) option of returning the printer for a new replacement (not a reconditioned one). Better yet, though I did have to box everything back up, Amazon arranged to have the printer picked up at my home at their expense the very next day (today). Moreover, a replacement printer was shipped immediately.<br /><br />I chose a Canon printer based, in no large part, on reviews, which generally appeared favorable, so this experience was unexpected. I would like to think that it's a rare occurrence and can only hope that the replacement printer will come sans any issues. But, I must say, my confidence in Canon has been shaken.<br /><br />Canon's tech support guy did his best, I believe, to help me resolve my issue. Apparently, there really wasn't much he could do for me, given what was broken, but he valiantly tried nonetheless.<br /><br />I will try and post back again after I get my replacement printer from Canon and supply feedback on it.;;1.0;;August 7, 2012;;3;;5;;0.6

(I'm running Mac OS X v10.7.3 "Lion".) The first few test pages I printed were great: The printer is very fast, and I was impressed at what I'd been able to buy for only $60 -- that's very cheap for a laser printer.<br /><br />However, I ran into problems as soon as started to print documents that were more than one page long. The printer would print one page, then the driver would pause, then I'd resume the printer, same thing would happen, and lots of times I'd get the print error "Unable to write print data: 'Gvw^". I have no idea what that means, but it probably isn't good. As I I tried to troubleshoot further (I work in IT), I also started to run into a related problem where every so often when I tried to resume a print job, the pages after the first page (which had already printed before the printer paused), would print, but then the printer would just keep on going -- the only ways to stop it from spitting out blank pages were to turn it off or pull out the paper tray.<br /><br />Today I got in touch with Brother support, and they told me to re-install the driver. Only issue is I'm on a Mac, and the driver pretty much comes bundled with the operating system. The Brother support rep. was very unhelpful, and didn't seem to be paying that much attention to what I was saying. Figuring I'd have better luck with Apple support, I called them and they said re-installing the print driver on Mac basically just means deleting the printer setup and then re-adding it. I tried that; no luck. By now I am fed up to the point of returning the printer. No way I'm buying another Brother after the support experience I had; I think I'll just eat the price difference and buy a cheap HP instead.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is I don't know for sure it's not a driver issue -- maybe the printer works fine on Windows. I do know, however, that I checked the driver version on my computer versus the one available for download from Brother's website, and they're identical.;;2.0;;February 25, 2012;;15;;31;;0.483871

It works as promised, with easy set-up and good speed. This printer, however, is designed to make you send back perfectly good toner when you buy a new cartridge. Some printers continue to print when the toner is low. This one does not. That is not so bad, but there is not an override option. So, when it decides you are out of toner, that is it.<br /><br />On previous Brother printers there was a hack to fool the printer. It involved putting electrical tape over an optical sensor. Those who did this said they got another 1000 pages from the cartridge. Of course, longer cartridge life does not make Brother any money, so this model was designed to prevent that hack. There is no optical sensor. There is a toner flag that you will have to reset.<br /><br />This printer was designed to make you waste toner, Brother figuring that it can sell the printer itself for cheap so long as they make up the difference in frequent replacement cartridge sales. No one will buy a low-volume cartridge, so Brother designed the cartridges so that you cannot use all of them; they get to claim that they give you a lot of toner, and you buy cartridges as though they had not. This printer's design was dictated by Brother's desire to prevent a work-around that people had discovered for previous models. So, if you buy this printer, know that you will have to hack the printer cartridge to get the toner that you pay for. It is a different hack from previous models, this one increasing the chances that you will spill toner on yourself.<br /><br />Of course, there is no flag to set on your starter-cartridge, so there is no way to hack that. When they say it is half full, know that you will only be able to use about half of that half-cartridge.;;2.0;;March 27, 2011;;6;;13;;0.461538

My wife had a particular need for it for work, and so we picked it up on sale.<br /><br />The print quality is what you'd expect from a color laser, and the toner usage and cost hasn't been bad at all.<br /><br />But it's been a nightmare with regard to network configuration. I've used networked Brother brand printers for years.  With those, it's been incredibly easy and simple to set up from a new computer.  Just add a local printer with a TCP/IP port, choose a printer model that approximates the actual physical device, and off you go.<br /><br />Not so with this printer driver.  The network configuration itself is solid.  I can log into the darn thing via the little built-in web server, ping it, even configure all sorts of settings.  But no matter what I do, I can't seem to get the driver to communicate with the printer reliably.  Here's what I've done:<br /><br />1. Full Feature Software and Driver.  First, it's a 300MB+ download.  You'd expect that the darn thing would be able to search the network and find the printer.  But no.  It prompts each computer to be attached to the printer via USB for initial setup.  Well, OK.  We have laptops, so it's not a huge deal, but I can imagine this could be a problem with reasonably sized networks.  Even this wouldn't be a big deal, except that periodically you need to delete and re-create the printer in Windows.  If I had easy access to the printer via USB, I wouldn't have bought a networked printer.  It would be funny if it weren't sad.  You launch the installer, then selection "Configure to print over the Wireless Network" (as if there were only one "Wireless Network" in the world).  The very next prompt is to plug connect the printer and computer via USB.<br /><br />Sadly, choosing "Configure to print over the Network" yields even sorrier results.  Even when I plug in the IP address, the driver can't seem to figure out there's a printer at the other end.  Remember, the entire time I'm connected to the printer via IP through its embedded web server.<br /><br />Toggling the Windows firewall does nothing in either case.<br /><br />2. HP Laserjet Basic Driver.  So there's a second driver pack, about a 25MB download.  Again, it prompts to connect me to the printer via USB to complete the install.  OK, I do that, but when it tries to detect the printer, no dice, and the only option is to cancel out.<br /><br />3.  The old tried and true.  Create a local printer along with an IP port.  Select "Have windows disk" and then select the .inf from the directory to which I've extracted the "basic install" executable package with 7-zip.  Not bad.  I can print, until I reboot.  At which point I have to re-create the printer within Windows. Jumping Jehosaphat.<br /><br />Now, lest you blame me for keeping a quirky network - it's really clean.  Maybe a half-dozen clients.  I have multiple VOIP devices on it (a Microcell and Vonage device), as well as an old B/W Brother printer that's been working flawlessly for about 5 years now.  The kicker is that the HP Network Diagnostic Utility finds the stupid printer just fine regardless of the Windows firewall state.<br /><br />Long story short, I gave my wife a 6 foot USB cable and she plugs it in when she needs to print color.  Otherwise, she prints to our brother laser printer.  It's cheaper per page anyway.<br /><br />If I had to do it over again, I'd spend the extra $100 on the Brother color laser.;;2.0;;January 14, 2012;;4;;6;;0.666667

I feel like you need a masters degree to run the damn thing or a one day course to have someone show you how to do the easiest stuff...and I am FAR from illiterate on how to use a printer or a computer...<br /><br />anyway, i am 'old dog', don't like changes and guess I just have to suffer through figuring out how to do what I want....other than THIS stuff, so far I like the damn thing...  WHY they have to make everything SO complicated it beyond me....it should be way more simple and to the point....  I did a search on how to print on both sides of the paper and about 25 things came up and NONE of them addressed this one simple question. NONE. THAT IS RIDICULOUS to me....  if you need simple to the point instructions on how to do what you want to do THIS IS NOT FOR YOU trust me.... to say the least i am far from looking forward to attempting to actually SCAN anything and get what I want so I can use the end result or send it to anyone.... I am expecting a nightmare of a time to do something THAT SIMPLE!!!<br /><br />I actually wrote Canon on how to just print on both sides of one sheet and the guy sent me a huge amount of diagram, pictures and info on how to do this and it was so long and had so many steps I didn't even read the damn thing....;;3.0;;February 20, 2012;;10;;14;;0.714286

In a nutshell, it's a nightmare to set up for Macintosh and after SIX ATTEMPTS and 2-3 hours of frustration I finally just gave up. Brother provides two different sets of instructions--one in a printed user's manual and one in an online PDF (which is completely different). I couldn't get the thing to work on my wireless Airport network using either set of instructions. They don't even make an attempt to cater to Mac users in the least. All of the screenshots in the PDF are Windows screenshots, for example, and the technical jargon used through is different from the what we're used to on the Mac, which requires you to puzzle through the instructions. The instructions don't include Airport-specific examples, either. In addition, the machine just feels flimsy all over. I bought this printer because of the high-rating it had, but i should have delved deeper into the reviews because it appears I'm not the only Mac user to struggle with this. If you're on a Mac I'd avoid this printer like the plague. I gave it one star for Ease of Setup and  couldn't rate the other criteria because I never got it to print even one time (except for the system test sheets--THREE of which are required (at least) every time you attempt to set the thing up.

After only a little printing, there was a paper jam.  Dealing with the tech support people in India was tedious, since they take a long time to respond to eChat, and they ask endless and sometimes pointless questions.  I learned that there is no way to access a paper jam, because of the printer's design.  Kodak quickly sent us another 6150.  While printing soon after, that one also developed a paper jam.  Perhaps the rollers pick up two pages at once?<br /><br />I could not cope with another set of looong sessions with the tech people, so I returned it to Amazon.  I am happier to have my old HP printer, which does everything right -- scanning, printing without jams, fax and copying.  The Kodak fax never worked right, either, and we had to leave it unplugged, or it would ring all during anyone's message as they were leaving it.

This is OK, and I expected it.  I entered an order for a replacement cartridge when it was 2/3 used.  It is now almost a month later, and Dell has yet to ship me a cartridge.  At this point, it is less than a doorstop, since it is hard to move.  And the printer will not print till the toner is refilled, and the cartridge is set up so that after-market services can't refill it. So now I put the stuff I need to print on a thumb drive and go somewhere else to print.<br />Customer service at Dell is deeply apologetic every time they send me an e-mail to let me know about another delay.

When it has toner the printer does exactly what I want it to do, printing both sides of the paper with relative ease.  I noticed that the price has come down - makes it an even better buy.

Genuine HP cartridges are horrible expensive here and I was trying to be sensible by refilling the cartridges, as I always had with my prior HP printers.<br /><br />It turns out that the standard refill ink is different from the new HP ink and it turns into gunk then trashes the printheads when it mixes with real HP ink. With all four ink cartridges being refilled at a different time (and with me no knowing about the ink mixing problem) it will now cost me $200 and a trip to Florida to get all new printheads and cartridges. With the HP 4500 selling for $50 (including ink cartridges that I can refill locally), the 8500A is truly now a door stop.<br /><br />It may not be an issue if you always buy HP cartridges.

The problem is that the print head often gets clogged, or print cartridges have problems. I use only official Cannon cartridges, but they still have a high failure rate.  Many times, the chip will read empty before the ink is really used up.  Fortunately, you can force an override by holding down the resume/cancel button when the error occurs. I have developed the ritual that everytime I am going to print a photo, I first run the nozzle check utility.  This indicates if all 8 colors are printing cleanly.  Most times one color is not printing at all, or several have streaks indicating that the nozzle is clogged.  In that case, I run the nozzle cleaning function.  This usually doesn't work but it does use up lots of ink.  The next step is to run the deep cleaning function which also generally does not work (8 times out of 10) and uses up more ink.  Finally,  I take out the print head and soak it in 95% or better alcohol solution, and then dry with compressed air.  I estimate that at least half of my ink cartridges get consumed in cleaning and trying to get all 8 colors to print cleanly.  I need to budget 2 hours or more whenever I intend to make a print to go through this ritual, and then in some cases after all of the above nothing works so I give up and start over the next time I need to print a photo.  I have had it, but the problem is I have heard that many high quality photo printers have these problems due to ink quality and the tiny size print head nozzles.  Nevertheless I am on a search for a more reliable large format high quality photo printer.;;3.0;;June 19, 2010;;3;;5;;0.6

The text quality is acceptable, but color pictures seem washed out. A lot of times I've seen some color bleeding. However, the killer is the amount of ink this thing uses. After about 100 pages of mostly (90%) black text, the printer started complaining that all cartridges were nearly empty. Considering I'd printed perhaps 1 or at most 2 color photos with the newest batch of ink, I don't see how I could be low on all three colors. THIS IS NOT a printer I'd recommend. I'll have to give this one away and buy something new, 'cos I'm sorry, I'm not paying $25 of ink for just two color photos!  How can I be running out of red/yellow/cyan if 95% of my printing was strictly black text?<br /><br />The software that the printer uses is pretty sub-par. I've had to reinstall the software twice since purchase, as the software constantly would forget everything about the printer, i.e. the model type, etc..  I've sometimes had to unplug the USB and plug it back in. I've had to unplug the power from the printer several times when it "locked up". When locked up, I mean the printer wouldn't respond via the software interface OR the controls on the printer itself! It takes about 15 minutes of no power at all to be the most consistent "cure" for the problems. The printer is connected via USB to a desktop I've had for a good 3 years, and works great, and did work great with my previous Canon printer.;;1.0;;December 23, 2011;;4;;6;;0.666667

On paper it had all the features I was looking for.  There aren't many inkjet printers that are both wireless and can email independently.  After setting it up and removing all the packaging and tape and installing the ink, I turned it on.  It started a self test and made an awful clunking noise.  The display told me I didn't remove all of the packaging, and gave a button to "show more," which showed nothing and was completely useless. After spending about half an hour trying to figure out what packaging I failed to remove, I noticed the metal carrier frame for the paper input tray was tilted up on one side, blocking the print head from being able to return.  I pushed it with my hand and saw that it was floating on one side, as in I could push it up and down.  I looked at it more closely, and saw that the frame has a screw on one side, and a hole for a screw on the other.  It was missing the other screw!!<br /><br />Having dealt with HP in the past on a defective laser printer, I decided to avoid dealing directly with them at all cost. I called amazon, and was first told I had to deal with HP.  Knowing how bad HP is, and knowing that they would probably send me a refurbished unit, I declined.  Amazon agreed to ship a new one and have me return this one. That seemed fine, except I didn't realize until the next day that the price had fallen significantly.  I immediately called Amazon to request a price adjust, seeing as I never had a working product and that the replacement they were sending me was being shipped when the price had already fallen.  Amazon was not willing to do a price adjust.  They were, however, willing to have me return the broken one, reject the replacement when it arrives for delivery, and order a third one, which gives me the same end result had they just credited me the difference on the replacement.  This way is very inefficient, and I'm sure costs Amazon more money, but I don't make their policies.  I'm just happy Amazon is otherwise easy to deal with for returns of defective products.  Hopefully the new one will have all necessary screws in place.;;1.0;;December 22, 2010;;3;;5;;0.6

I chose this printer because I have had great experience with Brother products in the past. The printing is not nearly as nice as my HP printer. I have had to tweak the settings numerous times to make it somewhat as nice. Definitely disappointing. Also, the black nozzle of my first printer kept clogging and black ink would smear over everything I was printing. I would have to clean it sometimes five times to get it to print again. That sucks the ink dry like nothing else.<br /><br />So I took it back and exchanged it for another, thinking I just got a bad one. Not so. Two months later, I'm having the same issues. The black nozzle clogs constantly. I waste a ton of ink cleaning it to get it to work again. Talk about frustrating.<br /><br />As I said, the print quality is not as nice as my HP.<br /><br />And furthermore, after only two months, the wireless capabilities seemed to have stopped working. I had an awful time installing the printer in the first place - ended up with 3 copies somehow on my computer. Now I have to plug it in my computer's USB port to print (it had worked fine wirelessly for nearly two months, then just quit). I hate this printer. I will never buy another Brother product after this. I am going to switch my old HP printer back to the "prime" position and use this one for back-up only.

The "quiet mode", a critical selling point for me, cannot be enabled on a Mac operating system, even though the advertising says the printer is Mac compatible. Which, if you don't mind the really unpleasant racket, it is.  Even worse, the User Guide that came in the installation documentation specifically sets out the method for enabling quiet mode in Mac. It doesn't work-and can't be made to work in the Mac environment as the printer is delivered. After hours of trying to find a solution through Apple and HP Support, I was informed (by HP) that I can enable quiet mode on this printer only through a Windows environment, and then when I reconnect to my Mac, the printer will be in quiet mode. What a wonderful fix. When you make a statement in your advertising that is knowingly untrue, and you compound the misrepresentation by including a second misrepresentation in the User Guide, it is to my mind nothing less that a fraud.

The paper holder is extremely tempermental.  It holds about ten sheets of photo paper and it's hard to get the paper in just right so that it feeds properly.<br /><br />A bigger offense is the ink.  It's very expensive and this printer goes through a lot of ink.  I buy my ink from a discounter on e-bay, but it's still pricey.  You have to be very careful when you put the ink cartridge in the printer.  Ink will spill and will get on your hands and clothes.  Last week, I put an ink cartridge in the printer and some spilled onto my jeans, ruining them.  I now put newpaper or papertowels on the floor and on my lap before I replace a cartridge to catch any spilled ink.<br /><br />I will be buying a new printer after my current ink supply runs out.<br /><br />4-14-12 Update:  My photos were printing green, so I figured there was something wrong with the red printhead since yellow + blue - green.  I called Canon.  The rep suggested I do a deep cleaning, if that doesn't work, do it again.  Deep cleanings used up a lot of ink and that alone cost me about $20.  I did as he suggested and it didn't fix the problem.  I was told that the only solution was to send the printer back to Canon at my expense for them to repair it.

In the present market for such devices, it is obvious that prices of machines have dropped and manufacturers are relying on sales of supplies for their profit.  This is understandable to a point.  With the Brother 7065 series, the efforts of Brother to sell supplies have reached the point where my next machine will likely be something other than a Brother.  Soon after I got it, my Brother DCP7065DN machine began causing a low toner warning to appear in not one, but two separate popups on my screen.  And this would happen again, and again, and again, and again.  They wouldn't just pop up, one would have to be clicked to make it go away.  An obvious effort to sell additional toner cartridges.  I'd purchased a new replacement cartridge when I bought the machine.  I've been using the machine for a long time after the warnings started popping up, and it has not run out of toner.  Meanwhile, the annoying messages keep interfering with my work.  I searched in vain in the Brother software setup for something to turn off for good the toner warning feature.<br /><br />Another conspicuous change in the Brother line is that toner cartridge capacities have been growing much smaller, while prices of toner cartridges have not. Once, Brother printers and cartridges were an outstanding value because of the long toner cartridge life.  Now that smaller but expensive cartridges that need to be replaced more often are being coupled with incessant and annoying onscreen messages nagging to buy a new expensive cartridge and have it ready, not only is the value gone, but the annoyance is enough that I'll be choosing another brand machine for my next, and I may even dump this one while it is still working fine mechanically.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />An email to Brother customer service produced the following response on how to turn off the warning popups:<br /><br />"1. Locate the Status monitor icon located in the bottom right of your<br />computer next the clock.<br /><br />2. Right click on the "Brother Status Monitor" and select Options =><br />Details.<br /><br />3. In the Details window, click on the settings tab and locate Windows<br />settings and then remove the check from all 3 boxes.<br /><br />4. Click OK."<br /><br />I emailed back to Brother the following response, after turning off the printer warning notification as instructed, but I noted that in so doing I was turning off all warning notifications:<br /><br />"Thank you for the information.<br /><br />Turning off ALL warning notifications is not really a satisfactory response to a nagging "toner low" warning that just won't quit popping up.  You need something on the "toner low" message that I can click that says 'I get it - my toner is low - you don't need to tell me fifty times - don't tell me again'.  If, for example, my drum life becomes low, I want to know, I just don't want to know fifty times."<br /><br />FURTHER UPDATE<br /><br />On receiving the "fix" instructions, and assuming they would work, I upgraded my one star review to two stars.  Now I am downgrading it to one star again.  The fix did not work.  It stopped one of the two popups, the less annoying one, and left the large one popping up that blots out my computer screen annoyingly when I am trying to get work done and requires me to click "OK" to get rid of it, the toner low warning.  To me, the impossible to get rid of "Toner Low" warning doesn't say "Toner Low", it says "Don't Buy Another Brother."  The toner, by the way, may be "low", but it isn't "out" and keeps printing away fine.  I suppose that Brother assumes that I'll run out and keep buying new Toner cartridges each time the popup comes up.;;1.0;;August 6, 2012;;3;;6;;0.5

In my opinion, all of the other reviews were written within 24 hrs of purchasing this printer. I've used this printer since 10/1/07 and after using Epson for over 10 years, I can honestly say that I will never willingly purchase another Epson printer again.<br /><br />Straight out of the box, this printer is extremely impressive. I was printing photos and other documents at lighting speed. The CD/DVD printing experience is bar none better than any other machine on the market...until you run out of ink.<br /><br />After one of the 6 ink cartridges runs out of ink for the first time, this printer is pretty much your worst enemy. The cartridges are around $20 each if your purchase them one at a time [black is the only cartridge that you'll probably purchase by itself, the other colors seem to run out in pairs]. Heaven forbid that you need all 6 cartridges at once. The set of 6 costs around $90 for the high quality and $120 for the high capacity. It dawned on me when I was standing in the ink aisle of my local office supply store that a brand new Epson r280 [with ink] is $85, while a replacement set of cartridges is about $89 after tax!!?! Why does the replacement ink cost more than a brand new printer with ink?<br /><br />Epson created a horrible user experience with their new line of photo printers. I absolutely hate the idea of having 6 individual cartridges [because the black is soooo small] when there is no generic ink on the market. I used this printer to print photo samples for ads and for clothing samples. After paying $120 for ink, I was only able to print about 40-45 8 1/2 x 11 photos before I had to go back to the store and spend another $40 to finish the job. The end result was that I paid about $2.25 per photo, when just about any other printer on the market [not made by Epson] could have done the same thing for around 30 cents per print.<br /><br />Go with HP instead, the cartridges are roughly the same price, but they are 4x bigger and there are only 2, not 6.<br /><br />Way to drop the ball, Epson.;;1.0;;March 26, 2008;;10;;14;;0.714286

I though it might be an error because when I printed a test page it printed fine.  However, as I continued to print an expense report I realized that there was a problem. I got 20 pages out of the initial black cartridge before the printer stopped.<br /><br />This is complete crap. This wasn't the cheapest printer on Amazon by far and I expected to recieve at least a full black cartidge with the order.<br /><br />I am terribly disappointed in this order.

If you lifted the lid with an error message, it wouldn't allow the ink to center so the ink could be re-adjusted/removed. Re-adjusting/removing the ink and placing the ink back is the only thing that got rid of the error messages. Very frustrating. This happened about 10 times within a 2 month period.

I don't have any more time or money for Epson products. They don't always work and their support system is in disarray. All I got from Epson was a $250 piece of junk, a lie, and empty apologies.

I removed the yellow ink cartridge that was initially installed and inputted the brand new one I'd just purchased. Next, the printer resumed the initialization process and stated that BOTH THE CYAN AND MAGENTA ink cartridges needed to be replaced. This is absolutely ridiculous.

Any printer that is designated as photosmart should be able to print 8x10 photos.<br />2. the ability to plug in a usb flash drive to save scanned photos--this printer has only one slot for an SD card<br />3. larger ink cartridges--These are so small that I expect they will need to be replaced often<br />4. A smoother set up process. My set up process did not complete by itself. It was hung up on the "alignment process" and I was I bought this printer for the duplexing and digital fax capabilities as well as the option of printing directing from an iPad and iPhone.<br />5. A larger scanning area. You can only scan documents up to about 8 1/2 x 12 inches, not even the size of legal paper!<br />6. Something to stop printed documents from falling to the floor. While the printer looks very sleek, the lack of this feature could become annoying very quickly!<br /><br />The pluses are:<br />1. Printing from an iphone or ipad on the same wifi network is very easy<br />2. Printing from a remote location is also easy via an HP assigned email address. All you have to do is email the documents you want to print to the email address assigned to your printer.<br />3. The duplexing feature works very well. Be sure to buy fast drying paper for optimal results, and be at the printer to catch the printed documemts before they fall!<br /><br />The tablet is interesting, and innovative, I suppose. But I don't need it, and don't see the advantage of having it if I already have an iPad because it is heavier, and the touch screen is not as smooth as the ipad. Plus, when it is docked on the printer, it gets in the way of the lid for the scanner. I would have preferred the option to buy an AirPrint compatible printer with efaxing and duplexing that did not come with such a large tablet.<br /><br />Overall, the printer is fine, and I will keep it for the AirPrint,  duplexing, and efax capabilities because, with so few AirPrint printers in the market, it was the best option at the time I decided to buy.

I have it hooked up to one machine via USB and it is also on the network. It is fast to print, fast to copy, fast to scan. If you don't need faxing, you can go with the less expensive but otherwise identical x363.<br /><br />The bad: Lexmark provides no 64-bit linux scanner drivers, period. This is not revealed anywhere, and I had even gone to the trouble of checking out the scanning manual available at the excellent Lexmark web site. A general lack of scanner drivers is a common state of affairs in the Linux world, but given the explicit support for linux for this printer (one of the reasons I bought it) I assumed wrongly that the scanner drivers would be available in both 32 and 64-bit. Lexmark technical support responded within 24 hours, as promised, but the response was useless and I never thought they understood my question (when would 64-bit drivers be available). There are 32-bit scanner drivers. They're a little clunky, but scanning does work, e.g. via xsane.<br /><br />On the other hand, the Linux printing support (via cups), is excellent.<br /><br />UPDATE: As of mid 2011, there is now a 64-bit linux scan driver, and, while clumsy, it works!

R3GE2PQMFH7RCM;;http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AW0KGHYAZU184;;Printer;;B001PO6IL0;;HP Officejet Pro 8000 Wireless Printer;;I hate this printer!;;This printer was a nightmare to set up. A cable specified in the flimsy and poorly written set-up guide was missing, and the instructions for setting up the wireless were far from intuitive (let alone helpful).<br /><br />Once it was set up it printed OK, very quietly and relatively quickly -- but for the life of me I could not figure out how to switch from printing in all color to B&W only. I assume this is possible -- and I'm no Luddite -- but shouldn't it be easy enough to figure out from the control panel or print monitor?! As a consequence, I soaked through expensive color ink way faster than necessary.<br /><br />The printer also simply wouldn't work sometimes -- power was on, paper aligned, everything seemed ready to go. But because the interface is so pared down to virtually no visual display communication with the user there was no way I could figure out what was wrong. I resorted to turning the printer on and off a few times to get it to feed paper and print. (Also, it would sometimes grab huge chunks of paper instead of single sheets. No idea why.)<br /><br />I miss my old Canon Pixma. I hate the thought of junking this thing and buying a whole new printer but I'm almost certainly going to to do that. This printer isn't worth the trouble of trying to figure out how to get everything working as it should.;;2.0;;January 25, 2010;;3;;5;;0.6

Don't listen to the 2's,3's,4's, or 5's;;Reviews on this piece of junk were reasonable when I bought this a month ago.  Granted, I got a lemon.  It sounded good, and there are folks who love 'em.  But now that I've been through 5 days(nights) on the phone - each time with a new person following a script to go through the "procedure" to get this thing going, I've reset this thing, and reset it again the next time, and again, etc. etc. etc.  They eventually get perplexed that it's still not working, and say they need to take this to someone else and that they'll call you back in 5 minutes.  They never do, of course (twice in my case).  I guess that's a way for them to avoid dealing with their inability to fix it.  They just go away and don't call back..Of course, when I call back to ask for the same person, there is no such person and they can't reach him if there were.  Arghhh...!<br /><br />I finally told the guy "Keith" at HP (Mac) Support (today) that they've lost a lot of money already on this very unit, and I couldn't afford the time anymore myself to try to get a $120 unit going.  Better to throw it out (recycle it at the dump) and buy some other brand.  So he had a choice, either send me a new one, or let me throw it out and we'll all take our losses.  He opted to send me a "reclaimed" unit, whatever that is.  But it comes without replacement ink (now that I've wasted all the ink that came with the unit going through their silly test routines over and over and over).  Yikes!  These guys are nuts!  My recommendation to you all - anybody and everybody - is to NEVER EVER buy any HP product.  It cost me 12 hours of my time just on the phone, innumerable hours offline, and 12 hours of their time talking to me.  Everybody's losing money trying to get a broken product working.  You'd think they'd want to contain the damage here and keep the customer happy by sending out a brand spankin' new unit with ink and all.  But hey... I learned my lesson about HP, and my recommendation to you is to not buy HP anything, because if you get a lemon, they fail you as a user.  They certainly have left me high and dry and very angry and unhappy.  You know...  if the replacement works,  I'm gonna have a hard time actually using it because every time it'll remind my of very poor service, a lousy "solution", and an unhappy customer.  What could be worse for a company?<br /><br />So don't buy this HP printer, don't buy "that" one either... don't buy any HP product.  Because if you have a problem, it's gonna remain your problem and they're not gonna either fix it or keep you happy as a customer.  Certainly, this is a bad business model for HP, don't you think?  You'd think HP would have a procedure to deal with the occasional lemon that slips through the QA and gets shipped, to make it not painful for the poor schmuck (me in this case) that happens to buy it.  Apparently not.  So beware... Don't be their sucker.  Best not to tempt fate by buying an HP product.;;1.0;;February 27, 2012;;7;;20;;0.35

We send out the letter on high-quality paper, and use generic white paper for the copies.<br /><br />Although this printer allows you to insert two types of paper (one in the main tray, and another in the accessory tray), there is a significant delay when going from one to the other (it prints on the copy paper, then searches for more in the accessory tray for several seconds before finally resorting to the main tray).  This has seriously hurt our efficiency.<br /><br />I would not recommend this printer for companies that are reliant on a similar system.  You will spend more money to get less work done per hour.<br /><br />This would likely be satisfactory for a business that does not print so often (we send out dozens of letters a day), but be advised that this printer is also exceptionally loud.;;2.0;;February 2, 2010;;2;;8;;0.25

What the sales info fails to mention is that it has to be connected to a printer server or router. Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought it. Frankly, it's too much trouble to return it....<br /><br />Tech support goes straight to India. They asked for my mailing address 5 times but couldn't answer basic questions.<br /><br />The wireless setup, if you dare try it, is incredibly confusing.

Since the R200 is 4 years old I figured this one would be easily as good and likely better.  NOT EVEN CLOSE!  The photos are very dull compared to the R200.  I figured with the higher resolution and smaller drop size it could only be better.  The R200 has two extra cartidges - light magenta and light cyan, and is dye based instead of pigment based.  I guess the two extra cartidges make the difference.<br />  BUT WAIT!<br />The one other difference was the paper.  I had read reviews that said the Office Depot premium photo paper was better then the Kodak.  Well, before I finished this review I tried the Kodak paper.  Now I would say that the quality is nearly as good as the R200, just slightly less bright and SHOULD hold up better over time.  Looks like the Office Depot paper is going back!;;3.0;;December 11, 2008;;4;;6;;0.666667

Went to the Epson downloads page and eventually got all the proper programs to make the printer workable.  But the Epson site clearly states that some of the software they normally provide is still not Mountain Lion compatible.  For instance, there is no compatible scan software available from Epson for OSX 10.8. However I found that Apple's "Image Capture" program works with this printer.  Overall, the EPSON software is clunky compared to my old HP.<br /><br />I can not recommend this printer for anyone wanting to print photos or for Mac owners unless they want to fiddle with the print adjustments in iPhoto to get a reasonable print.<br /><br />The good news is that the printer works with my iPad!!!  The Epson has not jammed yet, but then again the HP never either.<br /><br />Ed in Sacramento;;2.0;;August 8, 2012;;5;;13;;0.384615

Unit hangs until unplugged and re-started.  It will not respond to any button including the power button until you unplug the power supply and turn it back on.<br />2.) Occassional ignores your computers print request until powered down and powered back up.<br />3.) Automatic document feader will not load paper unless you give each page a push. ... but sometimes it works fine.<br />4.) Will not load photo paper from photo paper tray.  Every try takes approx. 1-2 minutes. The printer warns: no paper is in the paper trya.  (but it is full) First you add paper... turn it around... push it tight to the front..., the machine grumbles for 15 seconds... pulls in the photo paper tray, then the machine grumbles about 30 seconds, then ding - a no paper in tray warning.  Repeat process.<br /><br />The one good thing HP does is support poor people in third world countries.  I would expect that HP pays their customer support representatives at least $2 to $3 for every 12-hour day they work. They just repeat canned lines from a script in mis-pronounced english.  HP has no pride in the selection of people that represent their company.<br /><br />Customer service suggested I purchase an extended warranty for my 2 month old printer.  The only problem is HP was unable to tell me what extended warranty product was for this printer.  Prices quoted were $24.99 / $44.99 / $69.99 & $79.99.<br /><br />Bottom Line: IF YOU ARE A GAMBLE...

The manual that comes with the printer is loaded with extremely helpful advice, such as "Is WEP key number 2, 3, or 4 of the access point in use?"  Why, of COURSE I know what my WEP key number is -- who doesn't?????  If for some reason I'm too ignorant to know what a WEP is, the manual helpfully advises me to contact the wireless router's manufacturer, who should be DELIGHTED to help me install a Hewlett-Packard printer!!!!<br /><br />After this little fiasco, I returned to the store and bought a USB cable, since Canon helpfully declined to include one in the box.  I tried to reinstall the software to create a USB connection; apparently the software feels that I am only entitled to one installation per day, since it refused to work.  I then deleted all the files that it had grudgingly copied to my hard drive, rebooted the computer and started again.  While the disk was spinning away, I tried visiting Canon's website to see what type of support was available for this product.  In a nutshell --- NONE!  The website is set up to sell these products, not support them.  There is one page where Canon's victims are invited to submit e-mail questions; when I did so, the website amused itself by repeatedly telling me that "no session is available!!!!!!!"  In the meantime, a small miracle occurred; the software raised itself from the dead and properly installed a functioning USB connection!  After doing a simple test, I found that the printing has a certain mushy quality to it, but it is legible.  It will do for documents that don't need to look particularly good.  Based on my past experiences with HP, though, I can safely anticipate that the ink will outlast the printer.  It should crap out a few days after any Canon "warranties" expire.  By then, hopefully I will be able to afford a real printer!;;1.0;;February 13, 2011;;3;;7;;0.428571

It was not the most excilerating job but I know printers decent enough.<br /><br />I tell you right now with technology that printers should be as simple as you plug it in and you start printing. For a basic home printer there are no "smarts" inside of the printer all it does it receive commands and execute them.<br /><br />This paticular printer plugs-in and installs right off the bat like expected. However when you go to print a test page or any page at all the printer acts like its going to work and then prints the first line or two of the page then just hangs... then after about 30 seconds you get this little pop up:<br /><br />"Print data cannot be sent because of the current printer status<br />Check that the printer is connected and the power is on.

Lately I haven't been hearing good things about them. Once my last HP started to fail I looked around and came upon this all-in-one. I was very excited to try something new - the overall Epson ratings from the public have been very encouraging. I'm no techno-geek but I'm no beginner either. Whereas I can set up a stand-alone or a network printer with my eyes closed this was a nightmare. They include drawings with the "get started" instructions but they are small (I have perfect vision). If I have trouble understanding what the drawing is supposed to represent I can't imagine what a person wearing glasses will see. Here's a hint though - if you're good at figuring out "Where's Waldo" you probably won't have a problem. The directions are good, until you hit a road block. The instructions then tell you "follow the steps on the screen" but at that point there's no place to turn! They suggest you look on-line under "Help" but they don't tell you where to go? I had to call support FIVE times to finally get it working. And that's another thorn in my side - their support is only available Mon-Sat and it's not 24x7. And it's not toll-free. Unlimited toll calling is included in my phone package but it's just the principle that gets me. The phone number to dial is California but you're transported to the Philippines. Everyone is pleasant - the first representative spoke VERY good English - hardly an accent. All the other representatives I could barely understand and had to ask them to repeat themselves multiple times. If you ask them a question not scripted in front of them they have to put you on hold and ask someone. That tells me that not only are the customers not given good instruction - their support representatives aren't either. Also - during the entire conversations it sounds like the wind is whistling in the background. I just pictured them on a beach while the vein on my forehead was about ready to pop. Okay - so now I've used it for a week. I'm still not thrilled with this thing. Scanning takes FOR-EV-ER - my grandmother's wheelchair is faster. It takes close to 2 minutes per page! However - the scanning, once completed is very crisp and clear - very nice. Printing - this thing takes 4 cartridges - 1 black and 3 color. Despite the 3 color cartridges I don't feel certain colors are "true" - especially grey - it seems more purply. One nice feature about this machine - which is why I purchased it - it will scan legal-sized documents. So that's a plus if you're looking for that. Of course that makes the footprint of the machine much bigger but it has to be for that very reason. I do wish they would offer this model sans fax - who doesn't use an electronic fax? Without the fax the front plate wouldn't be so cluttered with buttons. All-in-all I doubt I will grow to like this any better - the scanning (which I do a lot of) is just too freakin' slow. I hope I don't ever have to call their "helpless" desk again but I somehow foresee that in the future. The ONLY reason I don't send it back is because I have too much time invested in getting the damn thing hooked up. The thought of having the package the brut up again and then shop for another machine is more than I can handle at this point. I sent Epson a review with similiar comments above and they rejected it; I guess the truth hurts. If I had to do over again I would pass on this machine - definitely.;;1.0;;February 12, 2012;;10;;20;;0.5

I went straight to their website and downloaded the install package.  This had everything I needed except the Print CD.  I set it up wirelessly without any trouble and then installed the software on two more wireless devices.  I also had no trouble printing from the Iphone App.  I do a lot of printing and the first thing I realized is that the ink cartridges are mounted in a fixed location (front right corner).  It has tubes that run from them to the printhead.  This means that it is verry easy to setup a CIS (external ink tanks) to the printer.  On my old printer I had to keep the lid open so that the ink tubes could run from the tank to the printhead.  With the ink cartridges in a fixed location, I won't have to keep the lid open, and very little modification, if any, will have to be done to the printer.  The printer is big, but OK for what it can do.  There is a lot of plastic, and the paper tray seems very flimsy.  I would not recomend this printer without an extended warranty.  I picked mine up at Office Max and they include "accidents" in their warranty.<br />I have a lot of HP photo paper that I used in my old Epson RX595 printer.  I never had any trouble before, but I cannot use the paper in the 835.  It seems incompatible and the pictures come out grainy and smeared.  I tried the sample Epson paper and it printed fine.  It does print a 8.5 X 11 borderless photo.  The sample Epson 4X6 photo paper is exactly 4X6.  It does not have the extra perforated tab that you discard after you print.  It seemed to have trouble with lines and smearing at the end of the borderless print.  With the HP 4X6 paper with the tab(so it doesn't have to print all the way to the end) it didn't have this problem.  On the CD that I printed, the colors were darker, and a little different than the same CD printed on my old RX595.<br />The coloring book feature is fun to play with, but has no adjustments.  Some pictures come out OK, but others have little resemblance to the original.<br />The memory cards show up as a network drive on the computers that are setup for the printer.  You can plug a flash drive into the USB port and it will also show up as a network drive.<br />The screen is nice and responds well to the touch.;;5.0;;January 13, 2011;;4;;6;;0.666667

I thought that this will be the perfect replacement. I knew that color will not be as good as HP but printing things faster will certainly help. When I originally started to use the printer I was very happy, however after 15days I had to replace the toner. I was ok with that since the cartridge is only a starter pack. I put in new ones that lasted only 25 days. After 3 months time I got a message, "replace drums". I thought that you only had to replace ink, or so it has been with all printers I have purchased in the past. No with this one you have to replace the part that holds the ink cartridge. After 6 months I got another message "replace belt". I was confused once again but I went online and purchased a belt unit, that is the part that rolls the paper. So to sum it up, you buy a relatively cheap machine but you end up paying a fortune, every month toner replacement, every 3 months drum replacement, every 6months belt replacement. On top of everything I ended up having issues with printing labels. The label sheet does not go in the regular paper tray. It has its own slot. However it jams constantly and it can only print one sheet at a time. After about 20days of use I was not able to copy color. I received a message stating "memory is full". When I called Brother support they told me that this problem is fixed by resetting printer to manufacturer's settings. That is the dumbest thing ever, since you have the printer set up and you have to set it up every time when it runs out of memory, for me that is roughly a month, depending on how many color pages I copy.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product to anyone. It has cost me a fortune so far, not to mention the headache of dealing with all things gone wrong.;;1.0;;October 25, 2011;;3;;5;;0.6

The manual said that the wireless setup could be done without having to have an ethernet cable, but lo and behold, the installer asked that I connect the printer to my router with an ethernet cable.<br /><br />I was about to find a cable when I noticed that the installer installed stuff that I EXPLICITLY TOLD IT NOT TO, like the bing toolbar.  The 2 required items totaled 175mb which is ridculous and I don't recall how much the "optional" items would consume, but pretty sure it brought the total to to well over 200mb.<br /><br />There ought to be a simple install of about 12-15mb tops for those of us that want to do simple printing and not have to suffer thru software bloat for features we'll never use.  But the installer overriding my selections caused me to immediately UNINSTALL and revert back to my last system backup, to be sure I'm rid of this canker.<br /><br />I should have known better.  Family and friends have sent back a bunch of HP stuff in the last 10 years.  If their products worked all, it was full of shovelware, nagware and "surprises".  I'll use pen and paper before I try another HP printer.<br /><br />And like others have noted, the unit shakes too much and is noisy, based on the test print done during installation before installing any software on my PC.<br /><br />Update 1Feb2011<br />If you hook this printer up to your router so you can share it with other devices on your home network, be sure you get the networking security right, otherwise it's quite possible that hackers can get into your home network through your printer.

Here's why: 1) I don't know what the pages-per-minute is on this printer, but it clearly doesn't take into consideration the ridiculous startup time of this printer. When you turn this printer on, it takes- and I'm not exaggerating- 5 minutes of rollers spinning and motors making noises before it's ready to print, even if there is a print task pending. During this time, there's nothing you can do except wait patiently. Kicking the printer does not accelerate this process. Reason 2) yeah this printer is wireless- BUT.. very frequently, the computer will lock up during printing, because there's a message holding everything up on the printer screen. To bypass said message, you have to physically walk over to your printer, and press the chintzy plasticy OK button on the printer. Then, and only then may printing commence. This totally defeats the purpose of wireless printing. You get these manual-bypass messages everytime the printer gets unplugged unexpectedly, or every time you print and the cartridges are getting low. Reason 3) and this one just infuriates me.. when the ink cartridge "Gets low" (aka, when the printer THINKS it's low), you can't print ANYTHING ANYMORE. Right now, my CYAN cartridge is dead. I'm trying to print some sheet music in black and white, with "Greyscale printing only" enabled. Guess what.. I can't print it **even though my black tank is full**. You can't just take out the cyan cartridge and pop it back in either, because each ink tank has a microchip that stores how many pages it's printed. A software limitation deliberately programmed by the greedy dou--e nozzles at Canon stops the hardware altogether. Canon, I'm gonna go buy new cartridges, in the meantime, I NEED THIS TO PRINT RIGHT NOW.. SERIOUSLY. I am smashing this printer in my basement. Don't waste your money.. I've never owned such an unreliable product that let's me down so frequently.;;1.0;;November 6, 2011;;2;;5;;0.4

I've owned various lower priced Canon printers before and was always pleased with them. And I've owned a comparatively expensive Epson photo printer that only worked for a *very* short while before it was no longer feasible to keep it repaired, no more Epsons for me. This Canon is a breath of fresh air just like I hoped it would be. The prints are gorgeous, leaving me with little to no excuse to send out printing to pro labs anymore. So far I've only used Canon photo paper including the amazing Pro Platinum paper. That's some good stuff.<br /><br />Setup was very easy, took only a few minutes from the time of hoisting that behemoth out of the box. Noise level is low enough that I don't pay any attention to it. And the speed is fine since I'm not doing bulk printing. Ink consumption is pretty much along with what I expected, which is good news. I've ordered in but not replaced yet the two photo inks, cyan and magenta. I do NOT plan to run any aftermarket ink through this printer, I want to keep it working just like it is for as long as I can. A cheap Walmart style printer is okay to take chances with ink carts.<br /><br />While I've not had any bad prints from this printer yet, they don't truly match what is on my monitor, so I've bought an X-Rite i1 monitor calibrator and expect to have that all worked out before the end of the week. It's not the printer's fault, just be aware that the picture you see on the screen may not match what comes out of the printer if you don't do calibrations on the monitor.<br /><br />Last thoughts - I've seen discussions on the perfect stand for this printer. After all, it IS big and heavy just like a pro level printer should be. What I did was pull a 3'x5' dining room table with sturdy legs out of storage and made it my printer stand. Yes, it's oversized to some degree but that gives me room to lay out prints for critical side-by-side viewing and so forth.<br /><br />If you're thinking about buying this printer to turn beautiful digital photos into beautiful prints, I'd say go for it.;;5.0;;October 4, 2011;;4;;6;;0.666667

Had a cannon that worked great for many years but started to leak ink and streak the back of the page.  Anyway this printer is used for a business and it jams if you don't use a full sheet of checks.  These checks are 3 per sheet, if you print on 2 checks and have one left over, you cannot print just one check on this printer.  The check will print but then gets stuck inside the machine and you get a paper jam message.  The frustrating part is the check gets stuck inside the machine and it took about 15 minutes to find it.  If you pull out the paper tray it's up top under the print head, just sitting between the rollers. The paper feed rollers are spaced too far apart to handle one check and it's really hard to find.  I guess you could tape a singe check to a sheet of paper, but I hate to run tape through the printer.<br />So if you are going to be printing checks with your printer you may want to look at a cannon or HP.;;4.0;;May 12, 2011;;10;;14;;0.714286

(I currently have the HP PSC 750).<br /><br />Although the scanning worked well and the printing came out in good resolution, in their infinite wisdom, the folks at HP decided that it would be a good idea to gouge customers by making ink cartridges expire even when there was still ink in them. This has been particularly frustrating when I run out of ink, and try to replace the cartridges from the local store that might not have as much turnover and thus sells older cartridges. I find shortly after installing these cartridges that my computer tells me that the cartridges no longer can print even though there's still ink in them (I believe that it is just the chip reading the expiration date on the ink cartridges).<br /><br />In any case, you'll be well suited to look for a different brand when finding your all-in-one printer. On that note, the all-in-ones really are nice. It's a huge help to be able to scan, copy, and print both at the office and at the home office.;;1.0;;June 4, 2011;;12;;17;;0.705882

I bought it at my supermarket since I was in a hurry.<br /><br />The first few days were perfect. Installation is a breeze, print quality all right.<br /><br />A quick note on the ink: it runs out pretty fast, I had to buy a cartridge after about 200 pages of black ink. I used a printer refilling station since then which has been working great. I bit messy to pour the ink but divides printing costs by four.<br /><br />My main concern is about the Wifi. Wifi means printer does not need to be attached to the computer by USB, it could be several feet away. In my case things have been really great first couple of weeks or so. Now it won't print anymore using Wifi.<br /><br />I'm changing jobs right now, so I need a reliable printer that can print my resume just before I leave the house, if I spot a last-minute typo. The Wifithing works one out of three times. After a few hours it works again. The Canon network troubleshooting tool is useless.<br /><br />The big joke on Canon I guess is that I didn't ask for Wifi, and didn't factor it in the buying process. But since it's there, I got used to it in the first weeks, and now I enrage when it doesn't print. without the Wifiprinter is worth 4 stars.<br /><br />Hope this review can help anybody with their purchase.

The printer arrived double boxed from Amazon quickly and in great shape.  I un boxed it and set it on the desk. It is heavy and solid but not too big.  I had a Cannon 990 cxe or something like that and it was a little bigger.  I pulled the plastic off plugged it in and installed ink and paper as per the quick start instructions.  After initial set up with the disk in mac and hooked up via usb the first test page came out and it looked fine to me.  text looked really sharp (even though some reviews said to pick the fine detail setting for best text)  I could not find that setting either on the printer or on the software.  It looked pretty good to me anyway.  Some have commented about the paper exit tray being a little flimsy....and it is, and i will probably just have it come out enough to gently guide the paper out and down, partially resting on the desk.  I think full extending the multiple sleeved thin plastic tray will eventually just fall apart.  It probably could have been made thicker and more robust.  All the other points felt firm and solid.  The scanner lid felt solid as did the cover for the ink area.  The ADF cover that folds down is also a little thin like the paper tray but unlike the output tray the ADF tray is supported better on both ends and is of one piece construction.  The touch screen is bring easy to adjust and reset, with bright clear graphics and easy to press buttons.  The display is not to busy with useless information and the touch screen is not too hard or soft in the response to touch.  Ink usage will be of little concern due to the purchase of a CIS. When it arrived I will set it up and give it a review as well.  Upon initial assessment of build quality and setup, the printer seems to be a winner.  I have to tested it to see how well it prints to the included printable cd or how well photos look but from the reviews i have read it most likely will not be an issue.  now its time to wipe a little of the dust that showed up on the shiny black parts.;;5.0;;July 10, 2011;;3;;5;;0.6

Being the only one in the house that understand anything technology I had to set it up. It was a little bit of a process to get the printer going especially because they didn't include the USB cord to connect my laptop to the printer. Lucky me I have ever cord known to man in my closet. After about a 30 minute process (not including wifi set up, that was a serious process) to set it up I was ready to start printing. But it wouldn't take in paper even thought it took the cardboard paper from the set up??? So I called Amazon customer service, who are great, and they sent me out an other printer the next day. Set that one up a little quicker having done it the day before but again it wouldn't take in paper???  I did a google search and found some reviews that if this problem happens Cannon's advice is to hand feed the paper piece by piece into the back loader. I went to Best Buy that afternoon, bought an HP printer for 20 dollars less and it set up in 10 minutes (including the wifi set up). Thing works awesome.

As others have noted, setup was easy and the user interface is simple. I agree that the paper tray is flimsy but I really don't think this would be a big deal as long as you're careful. I haven't tried the copier or scanner, and I don't have a need for a fax.<br /><br />After experimenting with printing, I have seen enough. I was hoping to use the printer partially for business and partially for photography and making greeting cards. The text printout is really bad. The text is not black, even with a very high quality business stationery. Granted, it's not Epson paper. My color business logo on a page of text is full of streaks no matter which settings I try. I was able to get it to look a little better on the photo setting, but that is way too much ink for business stationery and the paper wrinkled badly, as expected.<br /><br />I switched to printing photos on 4x6 Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Glossy. The first print, with a white border, is gorgeous. I never would have believed this could have come from a home printer. Then I tried printing two borderless 4x6 photos on the same paper. Both of them came out with terrible ink blotches at the edge of the paper. It smeared all over the place. I'm not going to put up with that, so I'm returning the printer.;;1.0;;June 25, 2011;;3;;6;;0.5

I must say they were very helpful, but this should not have been necessary.<br /><br />I tried doing a wireless install following the instructions on the install disk. The hints on the instructions do not match the display on the printer. I tried using the user manual, which was no help at all.<br /><br />The printer worked with the usb connection but I couldn't get either wireless or ethernet to work.<br /><br />I have a Macbook pro running Snow Leopard. First time I called, the Brother support put me through to the Apple specialists. Then I was told the 'color' support people had gone home, call back tomorrow. Duh!<br /><br />So I called back, worked my way through, again, to the color printer Apple support rep. She was very nice but walked me through the most elaborate setup I've ever experience. It turns out the printer starts with it's own ip address and acts as a webserver. You have to find it and select it. Then open your browser and work through the setup pages until the printer finds an ip address on your home router. Then you go back to your home router on the Mac and, with the printer drivers install, bingo, the printer is there.<br /><br />One thing that may have complicated the process is I have an Apple Airport Extreme. Through a fluke in the setup, my hone network is 10. address range, not the usual 129.<br /><br />I also have an HP J6480 wireless printer. It's a one button wireless setup from the console. I think brother needs to buy a few HPs and reverse engineer them.<br /><br />The printer produces a nice color copy and is pretty fast.

HP wanted to charge me $70 for a refurbished replacement or have me take it to a local support provider.  Quickly found out that local support providers refuse to service HP printers that are under warranty.  After another hour on the phone, HP agreed to send a refurbished printer without a charge.  The refurbished printer showed up the next day, broken in 4 places.  Spent over another hour on the phone trying to get someone who could come up with a resolution above and beyond sending me another refurbished printer.  The tech, the tech supervisor, and an individual from the corp. office were of no assistance.  My only option was to have another refurbished printer sent my way and wait for a call from the tech supervisor's supervisor.  Extremely unhappy with HPs service and conflict resolution.

So far I like it very much.  Below are my list of pros/cons, and are MY opinion of this printer so far.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The built in CD/DVD Printer is the #1 reason I purchased this printer, and it works great!<br />- The photos look great when printed.<br />- Cartridges are about 2x the size of the latest Canon printer cartridges.<br />- Prints great on "Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy II" & "Ilford Gallerie Professional Inkjet Photo Range" Paper.<br />- The LCD Panel touchscreen is nice and easy to use.<br />- The auto document feeder has worked great for me also, so far, and is really great for printing/copying those long legal documents that never fit on a regular scanner.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- No auto head alignment,  you have to manually look at the head alignment printout and choose the correct one. (Canon printers do this automatically)<br />- Photo printing software not as nice as the Canon software is.<br />- This printer is VERY large, much larger than I expected.<br /><br />Comments:  I am very happy with this printer so far.  There have been some people complaining about it only printing on Epson paper.  Well that is 100% false, as the two papers I have listed above work great on it, and I would bet most higher quality paper does... In another review, someone said they used "Office Depot Platinum series Gloss Professional Photo Paper".  I would not use Kodak paper with this though, as it never works with any other brands of printer from my experience.  Remember to also lay the paper face down in the paper tray so it prints on the correct side.<br /><br />I did have a few times where it draws more than one page through the printer.  From what I can tell so far, it seems to happen when I use a rougher type paper, then the friction causes it to drag the paper underneath it through also.  When I use smoother paper it doesn't seem to happen.  I have also been able to print fine on heavy 110lb Card Stock that I use for greeting cards I print, with no jams.<br /><br />This printer is larger than I expected.  I had a hard time finding a place to put it.  I plan on using 3rd party ink and cartridges, although they won't have the fade resistance the real Epson ink does.  But at least there are reset chips that work with it, unlike the latest Canon printers where there are no reset chips, for the past 2 years (which is another reason I chose Epson this time, over my previous Canon printers).;;5.0;;June 17, 2011;;5;;7;;0.714286

This MFP promises the moon, but can't quite deliver (at least not without a boost).<br /><br />IF you are buying it because you will be able to scan to e-mail, unless you have control of your e-mail server and can disable authentication, maybe OK. If you are the likely SOHO user that has an e-mail host (which most-likely requires authentication to prevent SPAM), forget about it, won't work. Maybe HP will do some research next time they upgrade the firmware and enable settings for e-mail authentication.<br /><br />IF you are plannning to scan to computer folder locations that are on a Windows Server 2003, be prepared to jump through hoops. Support was miserable on this machine. ONE person at HP finally knew about this machine right off the bat without transferring me 5 or 100 times. Apparently, this is a "Commercial Model" and support is only available Monday-Friday. For a machine that advertises compatibility with Win Server 2k3, it really isn't. Features required to set a location on the server for scanning directly from the machine aren't installable (namely the HP Toolbox). It took me a lot of trying to get it going (see my workaround at http://www.myitgeeks.com/Windows_Server_2003_HP_CM2320.htm).<br /><br />If you just need a color copier, fax, scanner at a reasonable price that will work with XP, you're probably OK.;;2.0;;March 14, 2009;;8;;19;;0.421053

I could go downstairs get a drink of OJ,come back up and, if it was printing, it would still only be on the first page of a two sided page print job. You can not print two sided copies on specialty paper, only plain paper.  I do obituaries, wedding programs, church bulletins, documents, photos, etc. I need the ability to print on a variety of paper types and weights.  Even when plain paper was inserted, the message center kept reading, "paper type not supported".  I called the tech support several times, three and four times in a day, from Thursday to Saturday.  Some of them hung up on me, but I did find three good ones.  The last one finally apologized and said "We will take it back, without penalty, I apologize."  Lexmark tech support is difficult to work with, they are in the Philippines, but occasionally you will get a good one, that is truly dedicated to customer satisfaction. That is the reason I am not rating this printer a 1 or 0, I am giving a 2 rating because of the good technician that finally helped me to unload this animal and get my beloved multifunction HP;;2.0;;March 21, 2010;;4;;9;;0.444444

Next Canon had the audacity to blame Adobe, and tell me to contact Adobe.<br /><br />Needless to say I wrote back a very angry email.<br /><br />Tried two other tests:<br /><br />Took the file--after shrinking with Photoshop Elements--to a photos store and had it printed on real photo paper, the results were the high quality I'd expected.<br /><br />Also tried an inkjet print from within GIMP's software, those results were better than from within Photoshop Elements, but nothing near the Canon software result nor the photo store result.<br /><br />I'm running a fast Windows 7 Pro (64 bit) laptop<br /><br />Bottom line: Don't buy this printer for doing color photos.<br /><br />Oh, and the scanner only does 400 dpi.<br /><br />***************************************Updated a few hours later:*********************************<br /><br />Canon is still insisting that the problem is Adobe's. A different Canon printer I tested with Photoshop Elements worked just fine, so I find it very hard to believe Canon on the Adobe point.<br /><br />Don't buy this printer for any kind of serious colour print work. And don't expect serious answers from Canon's customer service.<br /><br />****************further update a few days later***************************<br /><br />Bought an Epson multifunction and the photos were still too dark when printed with Photoshop Elements 9, but the pictures weren't muddy.<br /><br />Tried the Epson printer software, and like Canon's Easy Print, that software made a better image than Photoshop Elements. But both the Epson and Canon printer software are severely limited, they force sizing changes. GIMP printed images with the Epson were fine, except for a sizing glitch. (GIMP is very powerful free photo editng software.)<br /><br />Finally: I found a color setting within Photoshop Elements--not within the printer or color space settings, or paper settings options--and that fixed the darkness problem for the Epson multifunction and somewhat improved the darkness problem with the Canon but not the muddy print problem from Photoshop Elements on the Canon.<br /><br />I've been using Photoshop Elements for years, and I've never had to set this function--( confirmed this by checking the settings on my old XP laptop)<br /><br />Canon was somewhat right to suggest Photoshop Elements as the problem, but not having any idea what to do and then saying use our limited software is akin to Ford or Honda saying: "Sure, our cars work great, but only on very limited roads, also supplied by us, and we don't know how to make them work better on regular roads." In both cases neither would be treated as a serious auto manufacturer.<br /><br />Again: I partly solved the extreme darkness problem experienced when printing from within Photoshop Elements, but never did solve the muddy picture quality of images printed from Photoshop Elements on the Canon.<br /><br />(Look: You can use Canon Easy Print software and have barely any control over print size, and get forced crops, then the mud problems disappear, but that's not how normal people print photos.)<br /><br />So in the end Canon can say: "It really was Adobe's fault, don't blame us", but that's not how the world of software works.<br /><br />Bottom line, still: Avoid this machine for color work.;;2.0;;May 24, 2011;;7;;14;;0.5

I loved it, had no complaints. Till about a year ago, I noticed that the ink was never lasting. I was buying very good HP ink, the cheap ink was unsuitable for cards and pictures. Anyway I found out that the printer head needed to be replaced. I searched in many different places to get one, noticed that it would be about the price of a new printer. So I did my research on printers, ink replacements, prices of printer and ink. Looked at all the reviews on different printers from people like me. Had decided on an all in one printer. The brother MFCJ6510DW got very good reviews, it also is duplex which is important to me. When it came in the mail, it was enormous! Didn't take that in to consideration! I hooked it up to the computer, scanned well, easy set up with usb cable. The paper tray was terrible, it does hold about 100 or more papers, if you want to print a 4x6 picture, you have to take all the paper out re adjust the tray and print then change everything again for regular print. Pictures printing was terrible, the ink did not take to the picture paper, so the colored ink got all over my fingers, a day later the picture was still wet. It is wireless, you can use pic bridge from camera or phone using attachment from your cell phone,instead of a computer. It is a fax, which I did not need. I sent it back the very next day. Had to eat the shipping. Hope this rating helps you out.;;2.0;;August 22, 2011;;10;;23;;0.434783

I bought this printer so I could save time and money by not going to a professional printer every week. Basically, if you are looking for a printer to print lots of family photos, this printer is fine. If you plan to operate your business using this printer, you should pass.<br /><br />Images are very nice. Any bold font or colored font I use has to be converted from a pdf to a raster based file with a high resolution, and even then, it's not perfect. You can see every dot that makes up that text. If it's yellow, you can see all the red and yellow dots that form the text.<br /><br />My canon printer also does not know how to "auto rotate and center" unless auto rotate and center means "randomly rotated and off center." If I print a page front and back (which by the way, if you duplex it, you have to turn one of them upside down if it's a landscape format), the image on the front will be centered and orthogonal, and the image on the back will be rotated 2 degrees and off center by 1/16th of an inch. I've even tried to set up my documents with one of the pages 1/16th of an inch off center to compensate. Doesn't work.<br /><br />And don't even think about calling customer service. I was told that it was not the printer's fault, and that I had set up the files in the program to rotate the image 2 degrees and off center. And the text problem, apparently is because the printer was made for photos and not text. (Also not the printer's fault). So I could not get a replacement or a refund because the printer is not defective (according to Canon). I've printed the same files on other printers and they turn out fine. Without having to resave the files as different file types and without having to turn the second page upside down to duplex.<br /><br />I have fixed the problems to the best of my ability, but as good as it gets is not good enough. I've wasted lots of expensive paper and time trying to outsmart this printer. It's not worth it.;;2.0;;January 19, 2011;;9;;14;;0.642857

Lies.  You have to send the print via email to get it to your printer via your home computer.<br />The photo printing is no better than my $49 Lexmark all-in-one which is 3-4 years old.  And, it would not pick up the photo paper without several tries and much fidgeting.<br />I tried to print 35 envelopes for invites I was sending out.  It took a lot of fidgeting to get it to pick up the envelopes.  Then after 3 or 4 the printing moved off the envelopes ruining several specialty envelopes.  I had to feed and hit the print button for each envelope.<br />This is, by far, the worse printer I have every used.  I've had several brands.  I've bought cheap printers up to some of the best ink jet printers available over the years.<br />This I've learned.  If you want to print photos that will hold up, go to CVS or Walmart and use their machines.  If you want to print basic stuff at home, never spend more than $60.  You won't get much more for the money.<br />This printer is garbage.  The problem for me now is, I didn't install it, because I didn't get into my new office when I expected, until the Amazon return window had lapsed.

It does not auto detect or have priority. Computer settings and printer settings does not communicate well. It is so tedious to switch back and forth going through the settings. Printer is constantly beeping and not print until I cancel the job and reconfigure it to the right settings. Running back and forth to the printer is not fun.<br /><br />For Example:<br />This printer is not capable of using the settings in a saved document file (ie. envelope template). You'll have to manually configure it each time you print one. It will not use the multipurpose tray as priority, you'll have to change the settings for that too on BOTH the COMPUTER and then confirming it on the PRINTER. You can create a profile setting for it, but it you'll still have to confirm it on the printer before it will actually print. NOT USER FRIENDLY. Now if you want to print a regular sheet of paper... You'll have to reconfigure all the settings for that, change envelope size to LTR, change multipurpose to drawer 1 or change profile settings and then pray that it doesn't beep and not print. Actually, it will beep.. and not print, you'll have to run to the printer and confirm the right type of paper before it will actually print.<br /><br />This printer IS for you, if you're NOT planning on using different size paper or NOT planning on using the multipurpose tray often.<br /><br />With that being said, the Pro's are: excellent rich colors, wireless printing, duplexing, faxing, bla.. bla ... like what users below have said.<br />This printer is going back to COSTCO.;;2.0;;March 26, 2012;;8;;11;;0.727273

Brother obviously doesn't care about the inconvenience to a consumer who may have to struggle to get a bulky, heavy printer transported, unpacked, and set up, researched, and then back to the store.

After calling the Brother tech line (and dealing with an rather unpleasant customer service person), I learned you need to download a specific app to use the printer (iPrint&Scan). You have to print to the app, you can't use the built in "print" feature.  This app only prints pdfs and jpgs - not documents or web pages.  In order to print web pages or anything but a pdf or jpg, you have to download another (paid) application, convert them to pdfs and juggle between the applications (about four steps).  I haven't yet found a way to print simple emails.  Workable but very unwieldy.<br /><br />It seems like a fairly good printer/scanner etc. but *stay away* if you want iPrint capacity.

Why does this happen to me all the time?;;I researched and researched and researched until I finally found my dream printer! The Epson Workforce 840 was my last hope after regretting buying $75+ Lexmark ALL-IN-ONES. They would all break down within 3-4 months, called tech support, got refurbished ones that did not even last as long... But anyway, I got this printer (E.W.840) in the hopes that a $200 printer would at least last 3-4 years.<br /><br />Ordered the item from Amazon.com, got it within 3 days, installed it very quickly through wi-fi installation (loved that process, only took few seconds!) to both my PC first and laptop second. Setup everything including fax. Then printed few pages to try (very fast printing!superb). Everything was excellent!... That is until the next day.<br /><br />It was on sleep mode and when I touched the screen it started up, showed Epson logo, then BAM! everything turned off. Tried again for 2-3 times, same result. Tried to give print orders from PC, no result, same thing happened. I was soooo disheartened I cried (I need a good printer for college) but I called tech support they asked me if I had spare power cable to check if it was the power supply problem. I said I didn't have that but I had checked if it was a faulty outlet by plugging printer into different outlets (surge protectors and wall both). He said there was nothing to do but return the printer to Amazon.com. So I did.<br /><br />But please help me decide if I should get this printer again before my next semester starts. Should I give this printer another chance? Should I spend $200 once more on this otherwise marvelous printer to give it a second chance? Is this only a problem with all-in-ones or do such things happen to other single printers? As I have stated I am a college student and don't have too much money just for spending on printers and scanners, if they work only for a day.... Any suggestions or comments from E.W. 840 owners or anyone rooting for other good all-in-ones would be wonderful. Thank you.;;2.0;;April 28, 2011;;6;;12;;0.5

Although I personally have one problem with this printer... First of all it is a nice printer and it has a nice style layout... It also has a SD Memory Stick Reader... This printer is a great printer and although I have only used it for a few sheets... I think it is quite fast... If you will be having this printer for mainly for work... It will get the work finished for you... It prints pretty fast and as far as I am concerned it takes quite a bit of ink... Well my next problem with this printer is that it costs ALOT Of Cash for ink for this printer... It has like over 3 different cartridges and when you are finished buying each single cartridge... It will dig you in debt about $80.00... For myself this is Quite A Bit of money for ink... One main question that I have had for this printer is how many pages I could roughly get on the cartridges... I havent found a answer yet... But it sure should be alot of pages because the ink costs alot... I will use this printer more in the next few months as I will be finishing a bit of work for my father and I will know exactly how it runs and works and operates by the time all the printing is finished... But all in all this is a great printer if you wouldnt mind the cost of the ink... Thanks... Take Care...

We purchased the machine in December 2009.  An error code appears when the machine is only 5-months new.  The manual recommends that if an unexplained error code is displayed, you'd have to power the machine down for a few minutes and power it back up.  The methodology worked a couple of times but wasn't a permanent solution.<br /><br />We went through calling Brother, local Authorized Brother Service Centers and got the run-around and no-one was able to repair the machine because no parts were available.  Since it's w/in one-yr ltd warranty, the company is only willing to exchange the machine with a refurbished one.  I have a real problem with Brother as they're not the premier manufacturer for laser all-in-one machines.  I definitely would not purchase another Brother machine.

Epson's partner that supplies Linux drivers does a great jog and the installation of that driver went smoothly.  The color range and accuracy is superb.  The print times reasonable. I've had no problem with the printer.<br /><br />Out of scope for most of you:  all the computers in my house are Linux based.  The included CD for setup was useless to me.  Even so, setup and integration of this printer into my home network was pain free.<br /><br />I've purchased a few brands of ink jet paper.

On Christmas Day, I tried to install it.  After removing the tape and starting the driver installation, the carriage would not move.  I got an error message about not removing all packing.  After some very careful probing, it became clear that there was a chunk of white plastic packaging jamming the printer carriage to the roof of the unit.  It was intentionally placed - I guess something to protect the print heads - but impossible to remove.  I finally opened the case, and gently turned and twisted the offending piece out - and then the printer wouldn't work.  Not that it ever did, but maybe something happened in removing that cover.<br /><br />A call to HP support was fruitless ("Can we call you back?"

I used non-Canon ink for the first month or so but that was a real mistake (I've never had problems with off brand ink before this printer). I switched from Epson to Canon hoping to get better quality prints. I have spent a ton of time, money and materials trying to wrangle this thing into printing an acceptable flesh tone and it rarely does. Just my opinion of course. The speed, noise and ease of set up are great. It just seems like you need a fully color managed system to get this to work right. Maybe all of the people who gave it good reviews have a solid color management system or are not working on projects that are so color sensitive? Anyway, proceed with caution if you get this printer.

They are fast, reliable, easy to maintain, and inexpensive. So, needing printers in a small network, I purchased two HL-5370DW printers. Unfortunately, they have both been nothing but a hassle. The reason I purchased these two particular models is because they allow wireless connectivity. Setting them up was a little problematic. and I had to start over several times before I finally got them on the network (Windows server 2003). However, once they were up things seemed to work fine for a few hours, then everything fell apart. The two printers seem to disconnect from the network on a daily basis and reconnecting them is seemingly impossible. I've tried shutting off the power, resetting settings, reconfiguring the ports -- nothing. Nothing will work except starting over from the factory default. Certainly I'm not going to re-add the printer every day (I mentioned how difficult it was to begin with. And I'm supposed to do this every day?) Of course, trouble shooting and online help is useless. There are several manuals and it's sometimes hit and miss that I'll find the correct one.<br />Finally, after diggin through online help-forums, I stumbled upon the following information:<br /><br />The wireless network connection status is affected by the environment where the Brother printer and other wireless devices are located. The following conditions may cause connection problems:<br /><br />1.) A concrete or metal framed wall is installed between the Brother printer and the access point/router.<br />2.) Electric appliances such as televisions, computer appliances, microwave ovens, intercoms, mobile/cellular phones and the battery charges and AC power adapters 3.) are installed close to your network.<br />4.) A broadcast station or high-tension wire is located close to your network.<br />5.) A fluorescent light is being switching ON or OFF.<br /><br />I especially love number 2. Do you mean that they actually designed a wireless printer that won't function when there are computers nearby? Or how about the florescent light? This is a printer designed for OFFICE use! I don't know about you, but my office is nothing but florescent lights. Microwave? Check. Cell tower? two of them. High tension wire? Just across the street. I checked on these and found out that we actually have all 5 occurring.<br /><br />For this reason alone, I give it a one star rating. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great printer when it works, but the problem is, it never works.;;1.0;;February 22, 2011;;3;;5;;0.6

Produces good looking printed pages even in draft mode, and passable but not outstanding color pictures.  I will get an Epson the next time.  I am looking forward to taking a big hammer to this thing, due to the  paper feeder issue.  The effective print speed (including jams and manual restarts) is about 1 page every 2 minutes.

Turns out it wasn't free shipping at all and the total was $139 giving me with about what I'd pay with free shipping on Amazon.  The sales person also lied this printer was smaller then my former printer as another sales point.<br /><br />The MX700 was far superior to this model, they have stripped the printer's software interface of many of the great features the MX700 had forcing me to use computer settings for scanning that is often very time consuming and repetitive.  It used to be I could choose all the necessary features from the printer itself, but they reduced the choices and none of them work without adjustments on a computer.  It really stinks to high heaven, their engineers must be knuckleheads.<br /><br />This printer is a little slower then the MX700 and it's bottom paper tray has less paper feed while they worked on improving their backside paper feed.  The improvements they attempted to make on this printer are all usefulness and illusory, nothing of any real value when you're in a hurry and need a PDF scanned for a client to email.<br /><br />This is just a disaster printer, and believe me I was all ready to like it upon arrival.  It's a piece of crap and I hate it so much I am going to have to repack it and have Canon pick it up.  It's that bad.  I'm going back to HP now.  Like how dumb do the software designers have to be that it doesn't offer you one PDF for multiple pages that pops up after the scan? Instead you have to check off each one on a lame interface and save it to a folder it forces you to choose.<br /><br />1.  Canon has an additional black print cartridge to buy because they want to make money on their cartridges. Think of the added expense of having to pay for a large black inkwell and a smaller black well. Does that make any sense at all?<br /><br />2.  Canon did not improve the speed of the printer whatsoever, in fact it is even slower than the MX700. It's scan feed is equally just as slow.<br /><br />3.  The design of this printer is also not very good, it's really a very poor design of a round corner box, as compared to the slick MX700 style.<br /><br />They need to fire their engineer team who made this printer worse, not better, than the MX700.  People might be impressed with this printer but they wouldn't be had they experienced the MX700.<br /><br />Finally I thought I'd add how sad it is of the slow progress on print technology these days.  It should have been far more along by now.<br /><br />The Canon sales person lied on the phone to get a sale.  Free shipping my behind!;;1.0;;May 7, 2011;;23;;73;;0.315068

Now when I go to print it keeps kicking out an error message saying no pages present. There is absolutely no explanation in the printed manual or online for what this means. I've uninstalled the printer and reinstalled it twice, went looking for driver updates, re-entered my router password etc. and now it keeps saying it failed to connect to the access point (meaning the router, I assume). There's only so many hours I'm willing to put into something that should be a very simple process (I'm very experienced with computer software and hardware).

The store named Best Buy claims to have a 30 return policy. I bought an HP printer from the so-called Best Buy store and I soon ran out of ink.  I also had a terrible time with the HP printer.  The HP printer had very little ink, it took forever too get the printer to start, it made a lot of noise when compared to other Brand named printers, it took a long time to print let alone shut down and it printed a test page that used up a great amount of INK without me directing it to.  The HP printer also has very little INK that comes with the HP printer and when I purchased extra regular INK cartridges I ran out very soon. I found this out with HP printers; very little INK.  If you buy a regular HP ink cartridge you are buying what I call a sample HP INK cartridge since it runs out of ink quickly.  If you think about it the HP cartridges that show 2.5 times more INK are the same size as the regular cartridges.  You then have to ask, "how much ink do they really put in the regular OVER priced HP INK cartridges"?  I considered myself cheated when I bought the regular sized cartridge.  My personal opinion is that the HP 2.5 times more INK cartridges run out after printing only about 50% more than the regular overpriced HP INK cartridges while you end up paying a lot more.<br />The only good thing about my experience with the Best Buy store is that I was able to try out the HP INK supply and the printers' performance!  I could suggest doing the same but I won't.  I will state that I wasn't shy returning the HP printer to the Best Buy store because I was not afraid of this chain store and I was not satisfied with the performance of the HP Printer.  Best Buy says you have 30 days to return the HP Printer you should have 30 days but this is a misnomer!  I tried the HP printer I bought from the Best Buy store and I didn't like its performance.  The Best Buy store states that you can return it within 30 days for a full refund if you don't like its performance.  I took the Best Buy store for their word and I returned the HP printer to the Best Buy store after 25 days of use.  The Best Buy store would not take the return without me signing a statement stating that I would not return anything I buy until after a 90-day period from the time I returned the HP Printer.  I should have told them to F off and accept my return without signing their statement.  The Best Buy store also wants a photo ID from everyone when they return something.  If the item is being charged back to your credit card then you should not have too give them any ID!  This amounts too invasion of privacy (Big Brother).  AMAZON IS THE BEST BUY!  AMAZON DOES NOT ASK FOR A PHOTO ID!<br />My opinion is that the Best Buy store is not the BEST BUY! I believe Amazon is the BEST BUY!<br />MY OPINION IS THAT Amazon does have the BEST BUY.  Amazon is not like the so-called Best Buy store.  It is my opinion that Amazon ALWAYS gives you the BEST BUY.  I will stay committed to Amazon and quit buying from the so-called Best Buy store.  Amazon has fantastic delivery, great service, in most states no tax, in most cases free shipping, extended warranties are available and Amazon will take care of any problems immediately, unlike the so-called Best Buy store!;;1.0;;August 12, 2012;;2;;35;;0.0571429

Indeed reviewers on this site stated the very same thing very clearly.  I've been trying to follow directions rather than march to my own drum and dance to my own music (for which I have been known to do), so I went to both the Epson site and the Apple site and spent a good couple of HOURS waiting for downloads which never occurred and trying to find the exact site and link necessary.  I kept staring at the CD which listed (among other Windows and Mac versions , 10.7.  But I said to myself, I've been told by more than one source, NOT to insert this disk --God forbid I screw up or load something that shouldn't be loaded).  Perhaps the CD is misprinted and that's why they included this insert, Right? I continued to stare at the CD, with furrowed eyebrows, as if it were out to get me.  After much frustration I take a chance. (That's what life's about right?? Choices and chances.  Lo and behold the CD which both the very clear Epson insert and other reviewers said not to insert, quickly started me up in less than FIVE (5) minutes.<br /><br />Moral of the story: Rebellion is good.

This model was shipped quickly and arrived well-packaged and undamaged. Putting it together was pretty simple, inserting all the printer ink modules went smoothly, plugged it in and the printer started booting up quickly. Then my daughter and I realized there was no cable included with the printer that enables you to connect it to your laptop to download the drivers, etc. It is no doubt my fault for not noticing I needed to buy a cable. I am not a happy camper that Canon sells these printers, and they aren't cheap, by the way, without ALL the parts necessary to make them run. Now I have to obtain the right cable to download necessary operating features. I have absolutely no idea if the printer is excellent, average or junk, since I COULD NOT SET IT UP. I will obtain the cable, get it up and running and return with a full review. I DO think Canon and other vendors of printers should re-think their policy of selling the cables as add-ons.

The problem is that there was no support phone number on the manual so I searched online and found it. I called their supposed "24/7 Customer Care" 9 different times and each time went through a long voice prompt only to hear "due to circumstances beyond our control our center cannot accept phone calls at this time." and then it hung up on me.

If you have just a single phone line, intended for taking both phone calls and the occasional fax, then this machine simply doesn't work in a professional manner.<br /><br />If you have an answering machine set up on the line, then the fax waits for your answering machine message to start playing before it attempts to receive the fax.  In other words, the person sending the fax hears your answering machine message through his fax machine before the fax picks up.  This is highly unprofessional, because your fax sender will often assume that there has been a technology problem, and cancel the fax before the HP 2727nf machine actually picks up.<br /><br />I have experimented with all of the receiving options provided by the machine.

The first was an Epson Stylus 1400, I think. After that one, I swore I would NEVER buy another Epson printer because the ink was so expensive and the print heads become so clogged that there is no fixing them. After literally stomping on the first one, I swore them off. Then, they came out with printers that print directly to CD/DVD, so after several years of not owning an Epson, I purchased the Rx595 Stylus Printer. It printed as expected, beautiful prints (after cleaning the print heads to prevent lines appearing) and my CD's came out beautifully. However, after some weeks of non-use, I went to use the printer, and sure enough... the print heads were clogged. I attempted to clean them time and again, going through the very expensive ink rather quickly, and they would not unclog (the Cyan). Banding was horrible, and of course, I couldn't get the printer to print the color blue. After going through about $100.00 worth of ink, I went in search of a new printer, but could not find one that printed to CD's and ended up purchasing this one, the Artisan 835. Set up was pretty easy, the WiFi is a handy addition. And it prints beautifully. I was able to get it at Best Buy for $199.00. It comes with all the inks and an extra black in (98) -- all the other inks are the 99 standard size. The Artisan can print to CD and the colors are true and quite stunning. It is HUGE. The footprint of this thing is far larger than it needs to be, so make sure you have the space for it. It has a protrusion from the back, which I assume assists in double sided printing, but if you don't have much space around your computer, this thing will need a table all its own.<br /><br />Regardless, I give the Epson two stars. The reason for this is because Epson's are NOTORIOUSLY WASTEFUL and break down far quicker than any other printer I've ever owned. The rather expensive inks are wasted when the printer charges the inks, and when you clean the print heads, the ink is wasted in loads... and YOU WILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE PRINTHEADS even if you print daily. In addition, I have never been able to keep an Epson printer longer than approximately two years because of print head clogging. While there is apparently some way to remove the print head and clean them, such a task is no simple matter and it will surely void your warranty. The ONLY reason to purchase this or any other Epson printer is if you want speciality printing, such as on a CD. Otherwise, if you just want fantastic prints on paper, envelops, etc., then go to HP, Cannon or some other manufacturer. For example, I have a Cannon Pixma that is about four years old and it still prints like a dream and I have NEVER had a SINGLE problem with it... other than it does not print to CD's. Epson's charge you through the tooth for ink and then end up wasting it cleaning the print heads (you'd think they would at least come up with a system where you could clean ONLY the print head that was clogged... or better yet... come up with a system where the print heads did not become clogged so easily). I expect this printer to last as long as the other Epson's I have had and to behave in the same manner... after about a month, every time I want to print a nice photo or other color print, I will waste half the ink cleaning clogged print heads and test runs to get the perfect print. This is unacceptable in a printer that boasts it can do artist quality prints. And when you are going to pay close to $80.00 for the color and then the black ink only to have it ALL WASTED... well, you do the math. Take my word for it, stay away from Epson unless you are into printing on CD's and go with Cannon. Epson DOES NOT DO QUALITY. Your first prints will look great. But come back to it in a month or so and you will experience what I'm referring to. Epson clearly has an ink scam going on here, and their printers suck.;;2.0;;October 10, 2010;;63;;101;;0.623762

Terrible support.;;I have worked with PCs and networks for over 20 years.  I'm currently using a Dell PC with 32 bit Win 7 OS.  I've tried to load software from the CD, from the printer itself and from the HP Driver website.  It's all defective.  In addition, my new printer cannot see my WiFi SSID like my other 3 Dell laptops, Apple iPad, 3 iPhones, Roku, etc.  I called for support but unlike their competition, they only offer support Monday through Friday from 6 to 6.<br /><br />The printer itself appears to be decent, but without connectivity it is worthless.  HP seems to be in a downward death spiral and this is really a shame.  They use to be the gold standard.  This will be my last HP product that I spend my hard earned cash on.<br /><br />=====<br /><br />Update:  I spent 90 minutes on a weekday morning with a very helpful lady at HP.  She is one of the 7,000 support folks who work for HP in Costa Rica.  I logged into my Windows 7 Admin account, went to a HP controlled Web meeting site, allowed her to take control of my PC and she did her magic . . . but it did take an hour and a half.  She tells me that the driver software is indeed defective and that they get many calls.<br /><br />WiFi cannot be set up until the printer is set up via wired ethernet.  Nice.<br /><br />Now the printer works great over WiFi.  The support was very good.  My original criticism of the driver software still stands.;;1.0;;May 19, 2012;;14;;20;;0.7

She selected this based on the product reviews here. When the printer arrived, the disk said that it did not include software that was compatible with Lion, and that we should visit the support site to download the software.<br /><br />1. Lion has been out for about six months, and developers have access to the OS prior to its release. It is inexcusable for a major company such as Epson to be able to provide software for a major operating system in that time frame.<br /><br />2. The website is cumbersome, not well designed, and registering the software and signing up for a download is a pain.<br /><br />3. The driver and related software is 92MBytes. The site gave an estimated time of 2 hours to download the software. I tried to download the software twice on my wife's computer, and once on mine. The download failed all three times, and never finished. A company such as Epson should be able to push the bits out faster than that.<br /><br />4. The support staff is not helpful. They insist that the download problem is at my end. I downloaded a trial version of Adobe's Master Collection, a 5GByte+ download last night in about a half hour, and they can't deliver a file 1/50th the size in 4 times the time? Lets be honest, the fault is with Epson.<br /><br />5. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and told him that it was unacceptable that the printer should not ship with current software, and that it was unacceptable that a 92MByte file should take that long to transfer. Both he and the original support person insisted that the problem was with downloading from a website.<br /><br />6. It should be noted that when you download from Epson's site it switches from HTTP to FTP, which is the standard protocol for transferring files, and should be faster than HTTP.<br /><br />7. I finally installed the software from the disk. It installed, but despite following the instructions Epson's software installer says that the Fax printer is not installed. It does show up in the printer list though.<br /><br />8. Once the software was installed I ran Software Update. Apple was able to supply a 25MByte update in a minute or two. Presumably the software is now up to date.<br /><br />9. I insisted that they provide me with disks with the latest software on them since they were unable to push the bits through a wire. They said they were not set up to do that.<br /><br />10. This may be me, or our phones, but the quality of the sound, and the audibility of the people on the other end of Epson support is very poor.<br /><br />We have yet to put the machine through its paces. Based on my experience with this, and with the Epson Perfection 4490 Photo scanner, which I thought shoddy, and cheesily made, as well as the inadequate customer support I would choose a Canon, Lexmark, or anything but an Epson.;;1.0;;January 18, 2012;;7;;17;;0.411765

This does neither. It does have a legal sized flatbed for the scanner which led me to think that it could print legal sized paper. No such luck. Printing envelopes one at a time is possible but only if you remove the paper tray, remove all the paper in the tray, insert the envelope (or envelopes), print, remove the paper tray, re-insert the paper and re-insert the paper tray. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible."<br /><br />Furthermore, I was doubly sucked in and ordered a second tray for printing legal and envelopes.  I spent hours with tech support, which I had no trouble reaching, trying to get one of the two trays to print only envelopes and the other only letter size.  I have stamps.com and called them and they said that they get a lot of calls on the 8600 and helped me download the software for the 6500 which actually works for the stamps.com printing of envelopes, but only on the Stamps.com site-thank you Stamps.com tech support.<br /><br />But, back to the HP software nightmare. I now have envelopes in tray 1, letter size in tray 2.  However, when doing diagnostics or print head cleaning etc. the HP automatically, despite the settings, defaults to tray 1 with the envelopes.  Can I tell you how very difficult it is to use this printer with the temperamental software. Furthermore, I must hand reset the printer each time to pick up from tray 2.  Furthermore, I try to save ink by printing in greyscale and all black, but the HP keeps resetting to use all the colors. I can't help to think that HP is now using some cut-rate outfit in Shanghai to lower labor costs and boost the bottom line for the Packard family, but not please the customer.  Perhaps they can get away with this for a while, but I would not buy stock in this company as they are headed for the exit is this is an indicator of their quality control.;;1.0;;April 8, 2012;;4;;7;;0.571429

I called Epson support and was told that there was actually a utility that would allow us to bypass and reset the ink pad counter. They directed me to a semi-hidden (unsearchable) page on their website ... but the top-of-the-line Workforce 840 wasn't among the machines listed.<br /><br />Option B?

Called back to Epson support, which offered to send a replacement printer ... but would hold $270 on my credit card until my broke-down 840 was returned.

When I got it home and opened the Amazon packing was the problem.  A small quantity of brown paper stuffing inside the larger box did not prevent the smaller carton from rolling back and forth inside the larger carton. Fortunately the Cannon factory box and packing was professional and tough so no damage to the unit, I think.<br /><br />Everything went well although the set up instructions are not as clear as the MP730 was a few years ago and had it not been for my familiarity with that unit, this one would have taken much longer.  The problem came when I discovered that this unit uses 5 ink cartridges rather than the four in the MP 730.<br />The yellow one was not included in the shipment as it should have been.  It was therefore impossible to complete the set up and alignment of the print head and print or copy anything.<br /><br />I went to Costco and gave the department manager my model number and he sold me a 5 cartridge package for the whopping bargain price of $59.00 plus tax.  I took it home and opened it, inserted the yellow cartridge only to discover that while it looked identical and fit fine, it would not work because it was a CLI 221 and not a CLI 226 cartridge.  That's right folks, the Costco employee sold me the incorrect cartridge and when I returned they refused to give an exchange or refund and in fact could not have done so even if they had wished to, (which they did not) as they did not have that item.<br /><br />Amazon was willing to give me a refund for the value of the one yellow cartridge and told me to go on line and order another one to replace the one not in the package.  They also refused to send me a 5 pack for the now useless 221 ink cartridge set I got at Costco.  I know that the later transaction was not an Amazon error but nevertheless they and their supplier Canon set the entire chain in motion and could acknowledge that by providing me with a package of ink that probably costs Canon at most $5.00 to make in some Asian sweat shop.  None of this takes into account the two or three hours wasted or the gas to run out to Costco or the general aggravation.  Thank goodness I was a Prime member, otherwise they would probably have hung up on me.<br /><br />The whole thing has left a bad taste in my mouth for Amazon coming as it did on top of another bad shopping experience with them this last Christmas.;;1.0;;June 11, 2011;;14;;63;;0.222222

I checked to make sure the printer could handle envelopes and it does come with a tray for envelopes.  For some reason the toner didn't fuse to my normal, paper envelopes so that some envelopes printed with the letters oddly spaced or looking cracked like an old rub-on transfer letter that wasn't applied right.  Like the little tail of the letter "y" would be missing on some envelopes.<br /><br />When I rubbed the envelope to see if the toner had fused, it was clear that the addresses would just rub off in transit.  This was a huge headache.  I would not trust it with any envelopes again unless I was going to put clear tape over the address to keep it from rubbing away.<br /><br />This printer also can't seem to handle any paper thicker than all purpose printer paper or label pages.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />I've had this printer for about 8 months now and I truly regret buying it.  It is a fast printer that doesn't jam but it is not truly a wireless printer and is hard to make work with some routers.  It worked ok with our apple router  when we connected it to the router with a USB plug.  Our new router has ethernet ports only and the printer does not offer that option.  So far, I've only gotten one out of three of our computers connected to the printer.  Just the one computer took ages to connect and I had to use some magic secret combo of actions that I found through desperate Google searching.  Despite my best efforts, I can't get the other two to connect to the printer.

I wrote tech support a couple of times, but got no resolution.  I use this Canon as my "workhorse" printer, where 99% of what I print is in black and white and in FAST mode.  In spite of those settings, all my color and photo black ink cartridges go down continually, even thought I'm producing almost no color documents.  Tech Support told me that this is caused by two things:  every time you shut your computer down and bring it up, each cartridge jettisons the ink it has in its holding chamber to "clean" the cartridge nozzle.  The only way to avoid this is to leave your printer going 24/7 so that it doesn't go through the cleaning process.  Also, when I asked how I could set the printer to only use the large black ink cartridge, they said there really isn't a way.  If you set it to FAST, GRAYSCALE, you supposedly will use the least color ink, but since Canon produces shades of gray using color cartridges, you can't totally eliminate their usage.<br /><br />I feel this is a real design flaw, both energy wise (leave it on 24/7!) and ink-wise (you can't just use black ink).<br /><br />I'm disappointed in this feature because it means I'm replacing all my ink cartridges much faster than you'd ever expect (and not getting the benefit of their use!).  Otherwise, I feel this printer is quiet and does a great job at printing.;;3.0;;March 18, 2011;;3;;5;;0.6

I was directed to conduct an online chat with customer support regarding a firmware update. I was never given a preview of where this was headed, but received the "simon says - do this" style help.

Then opened Hallmark Studio 2010 to test print greeting cards. This and CD labels are PRIMARY uses for my printer. When attempted print we got error messages telling us the unit could not print double sided on the 5.5 X 8.5 paper, double sided print was being disabled.

Shortly a gentleman came on the line and asked what I was holding for and then I was connected to a stateside support group.<br />I described my problem to a young man and he immediately told me the printer was performing as designed. It was not supposed to perform double sided print on any but letter/legal paper. Further he volunteered that if I used letter sized card stock the printer would not perform properly.

I spent a lot of time on the telephone with Epson customer support (who were generally very responsive and good) only to have them conclude the printer was a dud and they would have to replace it with another unit.

I've been trying for two weeks now to actually get it to print something but it refuses. I've even gone as far as hand feeding it a sheet at a time and still it jams and then proceeds to tell me I'm out of paper. Also, it continues to tell me that I'm out of color ink when I know for a fact that we haven't printed a single thing in color since we got it. I usually have problems with HP printers but this takes the cake. Save your money and invest in something worth while.

Under Linux Fedora Core 11, the printer that I purchased left evenly spaced lines running across the image perpendicular to the direction of the paper feed.  This is well known problem with inkjet printers and HP has a page about troubleshooting it.  However, all the directions on that page describe using a program that runs under Windows.  The HP linux compatibility page for this product says that two important troubleshooting functions, "calibrate linefeed" and "print diagnostic page" are not supported for Linux.  (The "print diagnostic page" is different than a "test page" or an "alignment page", which are supported.)<br /><br />I was able to install the printer and have it recognized with no difficulty in Fedora Core 11.<br /><br />To demonstrate that the defective printing was not a problem with the printer hardware, I installed the printer on machine running Windows Vista Home Edition.  I downloaded the "full" driver from the HP site.  When this file is run, it installs the printer.  ( Run the file; don't extract it first.)  I printed the same photo from Windows Photo Gallery and the spurious lines were gone.<br /><br />The printer advertises 13 x 19 inch "borderless" printing.  I have not found any settings in Linux or in Windows Vista that produce a true 13 x 19 borderless print.  In Linux, I used Gimp (the "GNU Image Manipuluation Program"). In the page setup, I defined a custom paper size of 13 x 19 inches with zero sized borders.  In the printer setup, I tried to set the image size to 13 x 19, but this option was never allowed.  I was able to print a nearly 13 x 19 inch image, but part of the image was truncated and narrow borders did appear on the print.  In Windows Vista, Windows Photo Gallery, I set the paper size to "Super B 13x19in".  This produced a similar result, a nearly 13 x 19 image, but truncated to allow narrow borders.  Of course, there may be some other software or combinations of settings that produce borderless printing, but my straightforward attempts didn't work.<br /><br />I discovered that it is possible to print on canvas taken from a pad of primed artist's canvas.  This isn't a completely reliable process.  Sometimes the printer simply ejects the sheet without printing.  It doesn't work at all in humid weather when the canvas is limp.  Canvas is not a recommended media and the image must be sprayed with fixative to keep it from dissolving when it comes in contact with water or other solvents.<br /><br />This printer's ink cartridges do not have build-in print heads. The printer relies of feeding ink from the cartridges to a permanently installed print head.  It needs 4 cartridges, the HP #920 series: black, cyan, magenta,yellow.<br /><br />The combination of this printer and its driver under Windows is very sensitive to paper width. Don't count on using a paper width that doesn't show up in the print set-up menu.  Even though the image would fit on paper that is a fraction of an inch wider than the standard size, the printer/driver may detect that the paper is the wrong width and cause the job to error.  If you are cutting your own paper, you must get the width to match the width of one of the standard paper sizes listed by the print menu.<br /><br />The printer won't work with paper that is much thicker than standard photo paper.  For example, I found that a moderately thick watercolor paper will feed through the machine quite well, but the printer will only print about the first inch of the picture.  Then it ejects the paper, as if it has detected an error.<br /><br />This is the first wide format printer that I have owned, so I can't compare it to other similar products.  I rate it three stars to indicate that it is an average  deal.;;3.0;;October 13, 2009;;5;;8;;0.625

Set up was a snap, even if I didn't find the documentation all that wonderful.  As for usefulness, usability and quality of output, I am sure when it works it is a great MFC.  Unfortunately after setting mine up I did not use it and the next morning I discovered that it was completely dead.  At first I just thought it was asleep but after turning it off and back on without any response (or sounds) I surmised that either the power supply or main board died.<br /><br />The silver lining (albeit not that shiny) is that Brother offers a 1 year on-site service and they did not hesitate to arrange for someone to come fix it.  So now (2 days later) I'm waiting on the Brother authorized repair person to show up "some time between 12p and 5pm" to fix the printer.<br /><br />I'll reserve final judgment for later, but right now DOA products don't even deserve a 1 Star rating.

ZERO STAR RATING.<br />Continues to be a very poor choice for a printer/scanner/fax all in one. When it works (half the time) it is decent. The problem is it is very cumbersome to set up and loses it's settings easily. Re-setting to get it working again can take up half a day, often with no working printer in the end!<br />If you filter the negative reviews on Amazon, you will see a repeating pattern of same complaints on this printer. As you can see, many of the positive reviews read like glowing advertising copy and are obviously placed their by HP itself (or those HP hired to do so).<br /><br />HP service is very poor, they are only interested in selling you extended warranties, not in helping you to get their products working. HP was an excellent company in past years but has become a company with poor products and even worse service. Consider many highly rated Canon and Epson printers.<br /><br />----------------------------------<br />HP appears to be planting a few 5 star reviews for their own products, as you can see for yourself they are gushing a little too much over this printer and appear more as ads then reviews.<br /><br />I purchased the HP Officejet 8500 Pro a couple of weeks ago and have spent over 12 hours (much over) with HP tech help (Level 1,2...), at least 4 techs on multiple calls, all of whom are polite but of little help in getting printer wireless and scan features to work, or to work consistently.  I only blaming myself for investing much too much time trying to get the HP Officejet Pro printer working.  In hindsight, I should have returned this printer after hour 3 or 4.<br /><br />HP tech help often fails to call back as promised or takes 2-3 days to call back, each time requiring one to start at the beginning, as if you never called them before - despite them telling you to "be sure to keep your case number for when we call back...".<br /><br /> In addition to the HP tech on the phone, (while they remotely controlled my PC with permission), I had my internet service provider (ISP), Verizon Fios, on a conference call with them to ensure all router settings were as HP wanted.  All of HP tech help is available only during weekday work hours, and they are closed weekends.<br />  I am using all HP computers, a new router that meets this HP printer requirements, etc., so HP was unable to blame other equipment.  I would have hoped that HP did a more thorough job in testing and making sure their printer works as advertised.<br /><br />After returning this printer once at Staples I ran into two other customers who experienced the same headaches trying to set it up and were returning it to Staples (Staples is always great with their customer service and returns).  I am fairly tech savy but am near giving up on this printer.<br /><br />Unless you want endless aggravation, don't buy this printer. Until recently I used nothing but HP computers and printers, but will have to end this as their products and service have become very, very poor.  I continue to try and get this printer working, but must wait until Monday when the tech help opens. I am a glutton for punishment I know!;;1.0;;October 24, 2010;;19;;26;;0.730769

What sort of software engineers designed this thing?<br />2) it can take up to 5 minutes to decide to print something -- a lot of sounds are heard but nothing comes out.  For a long time.<br />3) the scanning software for Mac is really non-intuitive and it pretty much hit or miss<br />4) it is clearly not designed for the English-speaking market.  "Please wait momentarily" (what it says before your printing job comes out)  is not proper English.  I am no xenophobe, but this makes me lose faith in the product and the amount of thought that went into designing it.<br />5) after only 4 months the gears that move the paper make a horrible squeaking sound.<br />6) it uses 5 ink cartridges, all of which run out frequently, on different schedules<br /><br />I miss my faithful HP 2610.;;1.0;;March 15, 2011;;14;;21;;0.666667

I did quite a bit of research before I made my purchase and decided to to buy this machine because of all of the wonderful reviews I read on Amazon and on a few other sites.  I thought for sure I had invested wisely...I did not.  From the beginning this machine was huge headache and it has remained so.<br /><br />What it is supposed to do (the basics):<br />- Print, scan, copy, and fax high quality documents and photos--after all, it is a LASER printer!<br />- Connect to a wireless network<br /><br />What it fails at:<br />- Setup was NOT a breeze.  The manual tells you how to get it setup on a wireless network so we did that.  But, when I installed the software it wanted me to run the wireless setup AGAIN!  What a waste of time!<br />- Prints some of the worst quality text and photos I have ever seen.  My HP inkjet did a far better job and it got some of the worst reviews I have ever seen for a multi-function machine.<br />- Scans are poor quality as well unless you go in and change the default dpi every single time you scan.<br />- Copying is somewhat decent, but again you have to change the default dpi EVERY SINGLE TIME!<br />- Fax answers the phone every time if we don't get to it in time.  I have yet to figure out how to change the default for that so we just unplugged the phone cord from it for now since it was preventing us from receiving voicemail if we were out.<br />- Falls off the wired network CONSTANTLY!  Even though it shows up as "Ready" under "Devices and Printers" it is not.  We stopped trying to get it connected to the wireless network as each attempt proved to be futile.<br /><br />I submitted a trouble report about the machine falling off the network and Brother sent me a rather long and tedious a fix, supposedly, which I have not tried yet.  If it fixes the problem and keeps the machine on the network then maybe I will change the one star to a two star.  There is no fix for the poor quality printing, scanning and copying other than buying another printer and literally throwing this one in the trash.  I could not even bring myself to donate this machine as I would not want to pass on the headaches to anyone.  But, since I cannot afford to buy another one right now I am stuck with this.<br /><br />Whoever developed the software for this machine made it far more difficult than what it needs to be.  Brother could take a lesson from HP in that arena.<br /><br />If anybody who owns this machine has had similar problems and has a good fix for them, I'd be more than happy to hear them.;;1.0;;May 30, 2012;;2;;6;;0.333333

I had numerous problems with it:<br />1. It wouldn't acknowledge there was any paper in the printer until there were at least 20 pieces of either 8 1/2 x 11 or 4 x 6<br />2. It didn't not feed the paper evenly through the machine<br />3. Often, it said there was no paper in the printer, but would then feed the photo paper through and leave a long black smudge down the entire sheet<br />4. To scan something, I had to open a different graphics program and use the scan option.  The scan button on the printer did not work<br /><br />I asked that the company take this printer back and just give me my money back for the original printer that had failed.  They refused, but sent me another Photosmart Premium printer.<br />1. I have the same problem with the scanner<br />2. It still often will not acknowledge there is any paper in the machine -- even when I can't fit any more paper in the machine<br />3. It sporadically does not print within the boarders shown on the screen, so the picture will be cut off<br />4. About 25% of the time the paper does not feed straight through the printer and the edges get caught and chewed up -- especially when I used a 5x7 photo paper<br />5. The ink is expensive and goes fast<br />6. Be aware that when you buy the combo 'ink pack' for photos with the unnecessary stack of 4x6 photo paper, that it does not come with the black photo ink, so you need to buy the combo pack AND the black photo ink AND the black printing ink.<br />7. I printed one 5x7 photo tonight. The picture looked nice, but the corner was chewed up by the printer.  I then tried to print an 8x8 photo and the colors were completely off, even though I recently replaced the ink, and there were no messages or warnings on the screen telling me of any ink problems.<br /><br />Usually when I use this printer I will get 1 to 2 photos printed before something goes wrong.  I've gone back to ordering most of my photos online, and am using this printer only for black and white printing of various flyers and newsletters -- and even then, I have problems with it.  HP has had two chances to show me a printer that worked.  Both of these printers have had consistent and serious flaws.

It is quiet and fast.  Brother has automatically sent me software and firmware updates since purchase.<br /><br />However, the printer will NOT power on.  I've used three different wall outlets that have been tested with a voltmeter.  When you call Brother support over the phone, they don't answer.  When you try to use online chat, they just say take it to an authorized repair center.  The closest is 150 miles away.  So I have to drive 4 hours to the center, wait who knows how long, then drive 4 hours back home and possibly have to spend the night.  I would definitely stay away from this product if their power supplies don't last more 60 days.<br /><br />Update!  I got an email from Brother this morning giving me a number to call.  I called the number and talked to a tech about the power problem.  He set me up with a business partner that would call me about the problem.

I'm a world-class photographer with many shows here in Atlanta.  If you haven't noticed, HP neglected in its design of this printer to include a Photo Black cartridge, a fatal flaw!  What this means is that the blacks won't be a deeper black like in an Ansel Adams photograph.<br /><br />For instance, I compared the wings of a Monarch butterfly as printed by my old HP C309 Premium Printer and my new HP Office Jet 6700 Printer side by side and one can see wings as printed on my old HP are much blacker. The new HP gives them a brownish black. According to the Wall Street Journal, HP has over 1,000 ink scientists working at their Palo-Alto headquarters. This is one task they failed. The Black Cartridge is no substitute for the effects of the Photo Black and the regular Black working in unison to produce a superior print. As they say, the proof is in the pudding.  Since both of these printers has the word Premium on its face, one might easily assume that the print is comparable but such is not the case.  It's as if Col. Sanders had changed his secret recipe for his chicken without telling anyone and now one finds himself eating turkey instead of chicken!  I'm glad to see that HP has released a new version of this printer that might correct this deficiency. Tomorrow, I plan to return this printer and place an order with Amazon for a printer that still has the photo black cartridge as one of its main components.  Hope this review was helpful to someone buying a new printer.;;2.0;;July 24, 2012;;5;;7;;0.714286

I chose it because of the AirPrint and other wireless features, plus it's supposed to be HP's flagship printer. It looked nice enough out of the box, aside from the too-flashy, mirrored lid. Wired setup was easy enough, but wireless setup with my Macbook Pro did not work with the provided software. Online research provided several alternative approaches, none of which worked. I ended up manually adding the printer via ip address, but I still could not get it to scan wirelessly. I thought I might be able to live with it or eventually figure out wireless scanning, but then I tested out the scanner and scan quality was dismal compared to my old Canon. The price of the Envy was not worth the compromises on function and quality. I ended up returning the Envy and replacing the printhead on my Canon at a fraction of the cost, regaining full wireless capabilities (except for AirPrint, but that's not really a big deal).;;2.0;;September 24, 2011;;3;;5;;0.6

The trouble came when I tried to use this for scanning and printing photos. The two software packages that comes with this printer (Canon MP Navigator Ex and Arc Soft Photo studio) both are horrible!<br /><br />I tried to reproduce passport photos at home and the device would not allow me to print the photos in their actual size. Instead, the device gave me 17 different options, NONE of which is the original photo size! Some of the options include 5.6x5.6cm, 5x7cm, 4.5x5.5cm, 3.5x4.5cm, 3x4cm, 2.5x3cm. I am not kidding - they don't have an option for original size or even a passport size 2x2".<br /><br />I am a novice and I thought I was doing something wrong so I called Canon Tech Support. The rep walked me through the scan and printing process and got stuck at the printing options. The rep eventually gave up and said he needed to talk to a "Level 2 rep." He came back and started telling me that this was a software issue and that I needed to purchase Adobe Photoshop if I wanted to print 2x2" photos. He told me that I WAS AT FAULT because I was trying to replicate government material (it's a photo that is 2x2" - that doesn't make it GI). He continued explaining how the scanner/printer works just fine and that Canon is not at fault. Really? It's a PHOTO PRINTER. I don't want to do fancy photo editing. I just want to replicate a photo that I have. I don't think I am asking for too much here - I'm asking Canon to live up to the explicit claim they have made about the PHOTO printer.<br /><br />Also, the printer is huge at 16x19" and takes 3+ minutes to warm up and print. It drinks ink very quickly (I'm on my 2nd full replacement in 6 months). If you are looking for a printer for office work and photos, please buy a simple office printer (not Canon) and buy another Photo Scanner/Printer that is truly dedicated to photos (not Canon).<br /><br />Because of the poor service and support I received from Canon, I will not be buying another Canon product, be it a camera or printer.

What a hassle to get it running!;;This may be a good printer/scanner/FAX/etc.  For all I know it may also mix bread dough and and exterminate unwanted critters. I have not evaluated its performance which I am counting upon to be at least adequate.<br /><br />However, what has got me riled is the problems encountered getting the thing hooked up and running. After a day of wrestling with the seemingly unlimited options for setup, and finding none that worked I was torn between three emotions: 1] making it work, 2] returning danged thing or 3] pounding it to rubble with a large hammer..<br /><br />So, proceeding with the most illogical emotion, 1, I called upon Geek Squad to come and do their magic. I got the distinct impression that the Geek Squad folks have a particular fondness for this printer because of all the jobs it creates for them. Anyway, by spending something like three times the price of the machine, it ended up working almost as advertised; even the Geek couldn't get the scanner to work on my Mac, but it does work on a Windows PC.<br /><br />I confess that I have only fooled around with computers and the stuff you hang onto them for about 30 years, and I have concentrated upon being a user rather than a fixer of them.  I also confess having become spoiled by so many nice products that integrate themselves into my system smoothly and without the need for much effort.  For instance, my PC, Kindles, iPad, and my next door neighbors all lock in on my wifi router by simply keying in my password; but this Brother printer required a lot of fooling around including changing the name on my wifi (making it necessary for all the other devices and neighbors to have to find it and put in the password again.<br /><br />If you enjoy puzzles you might get a real kick out of this machine.  Otherwise, I recommend that unless you are very knowledgable about such things, look elsewhere for your next printer.;;2.0;;November 30, 2011;;8;;22;;0.363636

This seemed to be the logical choice. Same basic functions. Same basic cost. Nope, not even close. When it arrived it was 50% bigger in size (almost 2ft wide) and uses 6 print cartridges instead of 2. The 3 things I really can't stand is that it feeds multiple sheets of paper no matter what I do. The online help says load fewer sheets, so as long as there is only ONE sheet in the feeder, it works fine. The second thing that really fries my schnitzel, is that I tried User Support 2 weeks ago and they still haven't responded. The third, is that when they say Window XP or Vista, that's exactly what they mean. The printer can't be used by any older software. My fault for not reading closer, but not all of my computers can run XP. So Epson, what happened? You used to make a great product. Talk to me, you are about to lose a loyal customer FOREVER. If I would have bought a $49 printer (any brand) I would have been much happier.<br />Just a quick update. Epson finally got back to me and their solution is for me to send them my NEW printer and they will kindly send me a refurbished one. For real. Also, since I'm still able to print one sheet at a time the ink has finally run out after a hundred or so printed 8-1/2 x 11 sheets. Big surprise here too, the replacement cartidges cost $126 for the set at Office Depot. So, my advice is to buy ANY other printer that you feel will suit your needs. Epson has failed big time with this one, all the way around.;;1.0;;July 6, 2008;;11;;23;;0.478261

It finally gave up the ghost. After some research (and the fact that it went on sale at Office Depot), I decided on the HL-2240. My first impression ... it's a lot noisier than my 1440 was. Part of the reason is because Brother decided to shift the exhaust fan from the left side to the right side of the printer (something I didn't notice in the store), so I now I get to listen to it until it decides to shut off and go back into sleep mode. I can handle noise while the actual printing is taking place (and it does make it's fair share of noise while printing), but I don't really appreciate having to listen to the exhaust fan hum for 3 minutes afterwards. So this being the case, you might want to consider getting the higher end model with networking capability so you can locate the printer farther away from your desk. USB cables don't come in long enough lengths to allow relocation of the printer to someplace where the noise won't be so annoying. Other than the noise issue, the printer seems to do what it's supposed to do. Hard to complain about $79.95 for a printer, even if the toner cartridge is a "starter" version.;;3.0;;October 25, 2010;;10;;14;;0.714286

My initial reaction was to send it back to Amazon.com for refund, but I needed to print a couple of DVDs during the week-end so, in spite of my frustration, I went to Staples and bought the damned cable.<br /><br />This is a shame. In the old times when things were made in, and sold from America, merchants would have never had the nerve to engage in this kind of monkey business.

Along with another Kodak printer I own, the set up is simple and easy.<br />After unpacking, you install the ink cartridges and power it up. After it calibrates the ink cartridges it's time to get it connected to your computer. On the screen prompt it will ask if you want to connect to it wirelessly or via USB. After choosing wireless, it locates any network signals (including my neighbors). Choose the one you want to connect to and then enter the key. Within a minute, I was connected.<br /><br />Then, the prompt instructs you to insert the provided CD into your computer to install. That went very smoothly and after less on five minutes, I was ready to print. The paper feeds down through the back of the printer and the print quality is very good, especially the photos.<br /><br />The jury is still out regarding the ink cartridges, I'll adjust this review depending on how they last.

For crying out loud, the stupid thing doesn't even have a configuration web page!  You have to install some archaic-looking program to configure anything on the printer.  And if you want to configure anything specifically, you will likely need to install the special administration program to even get to it!<br /><br />Sadly, the configuration program can't even give you the ink levels across the network, all it says is that there's "Low Ink" (that quote is exactly all there is).  You have to go to the Status Monitor program, or to the menu on the actual printer to see any specific ink levels.<br /><br />The Brother online support is just as beautiful as everything else.  If you can configure any of this by yourself, you are likely smarter than Brother's technicians.  Since they couldn't even give me an answer to the question "Is there a way to setup anything more than 'AirPrint' or 'Google Cloud Print' by using a web browser?", they just hung-up on me.<br /><br />Until recently, I have used an HP OfficeJet printer, and I had bought the Brother printer to try since the OfficeJet that I had failed rather quickly, but after working with the Brother printer, I call a quick failure a simple and isolated problem with the HP printers, plus HP gives you easy to remember two-digit numbers for ink.

Installed this on a Mac (OSX) in about ten seconds after I decided to disregard all of the pseudo manuals that came with this printer.<br /><br />For OSX users, here is how the manual should read:<br /><br />Close all other applications first, because the heavy handed Samsung software will force close all applications even if you have documents open with no prompting to save any work.<br /><br />Insert supplied CD into computer. Run installation software. Ignore the wireless setup utility, it does not work (failed to recognize printer when connected via USB)<br /><br />Manually select the wireless network using the printer's touch screen controls. Manually enter the network's password.<br /><br />Print<br /><br />After struggling to understand the overly complex OSX instructions supplied on the CD ROM for an hour, the above steps were all that I needed.<br /><br />Tried to use the WPA buttons on my router and on the printer, this caused my Dlink router to change the network password over and over.<br /><br />After all of this, the printer was defective right out of the box. Would not load 1 sheet of Xerox Business 4200 paper without jamming: never printed anything because of this.<br /><br />Samsung customer support was pretty worthless, as their only recommendation was 'put the paper in the tray better.'

The store named Best Buy claims to have a 30 return policy. I bought an HP printer from the so-called Best Buy store and I soon ran out of ink.  I also had a terrible time with the HP printer.  The HP printer had very little ink, it took forever too get the printer to start, it made a lot of noise when compared to other Brand named printers, it took a long time to print let alone shut down and it printed a test page that used up a great amount of INK without me directing it to.  The HP printer also has very little INK that comes with the HP printer and when I purchased extra regular INK cartridges I ran out very soon. I found this out with HP printers; very little INK.  If you buy a regular HP ink cartridge you are buying what I call a sample HP INK cartridge since it runs out of ink quickly.  If you think about it the HP cartridges that show 2.5 times more INK are the same size as the regular cartridges.  You then have to ask, "how much ink do they really put in the regular OVER priced HP INK cartridges"?  I considered myself cheated when I bought the regular sized cartridge.  My personal opinion is that the HP 2.5 times more INK cartridges run out after printing only about 50% more than the regular overpriced HP INK cartridges while you end up paying a lot more.<br />The only good thing about my experience with the Best Buy store is that I was able to try out the HP INK supply and the printers' performance!  I could suggest doing the same but I won't.  I will state that I wasn't shy returning the HP printer to the Best Buy store because I was not afraid of this chain store and I was not satisfied with the performance of the HP Printer.  Best Buy says you have 30 days to return the HP Printer you should have 30 days but this is a misnomer!  I tried the HP printer I bought from the Best Buy store and I didn't like its performance.  The Best Buy store states that you can return it within 30 days for a full refund if you don't like its performance.  I took the Best Buy store for their word and I returned the HP printer to the Best Buy store after 25 days of use.  The Best Buy store would not take the return without me signing a statement stating that I would not return anything I buy until after a 90-day period from the time I returned the HP Printer.  I should have told them to F off and accept my return without signing their statement.  The Best Buy store also wants a photo ID from everyone when they return something.  If the item is being charged back to your credit card then you should not have too give them any ID!  This amounts too invasion of privacy (Big Brother).  AMAZON IS THE BEST BUY!  AMAZON DOES NOT ASK FOR A PHOTO ID!<br />My opinion is that the Best Buy store is not the BEST BUY! I believe Amazon is the BEST BUY!<br />MY OPINION IS THAT Amazon does have the BEST BUY.  Amazon is not like the so-called Best Buy store.  It is my opinion that Amazon ALWAYS gives you the BEST BUY.  I will stay committed to Amazon and quit buying from the so-called Best Buy store.  Amazon has fantastic delivery, great service, in most states no tax, in most cases free shipping, extended warranties are available and Amazon will take care of any problems immediately, unlike the so-called Best Buy store!;;1.0;;August 12, 2012;;0;;20;;0.0

After some attempts at correcting uess uonnectivity problems, we finally uninstalled the software and started over.  I guess we did something right as then, it at least could be found by the computer, but wouldn't print!  The Mac installation was far easier than the PC.  Ultimately, after repeated tweaks, the Mac would print once, then stop because the ink cart. was not recognized.  Sure enough, I ink had used some of my remaining generic ink and the NEW IMPROVED 870 didn't like it! Here we go again.  The original 860 worked great for about 18 mos and did well w generic ink, then just died (power quit) now the new one arrives and relegates you back to the expensive OEM ink.

The printer is great and easy to use. EXCEPT if you want to print an envelope or print on anything other than standard letter or legal paper. This is because, unlike my HP, it has the slip feed in the back of the unit. Now I have this printer in an enclosure at my desk. To print an envelope, I have to slide the printer all the way out, turn it 90 degrees and fiddle with some levers to print just one envelope. I suppose if you put this printer so it sits sideways on a table, this might work ok, but for me it's a pain in the butt. Fortunately, I have an HP Color Laser next to it that has a front feed.

The other would not load pages and jammed<br />every single time and was returned directly to Epson via Fedex replacement<br />(BIG MISTAKE) Epson pays freight both ways for 12 months warranty but they<br />do NOT have an 800 number and do not 'do email' in a professional manner -<br />nor do they send you status or tracking numbers for anything.  They also<br />require a $130 deposit on a credit card and the paper instructions for<br />returns is contained on many random sheets - a real pain. Besides, Fedex<br />does NOT do home pickup - you have to take it to a place and put it in a<br />big pile where the attendant assures you that they are not responsible for<br />anything and now receipt - they claim it is a 'service.'<br />The first printer from Epson was lost by Fedex and never delivered - the<br />second worked on a USB cable and has worked in an un-eventful manner so<br />far.  I do fear replacing ink cartridges knowing just how sensitive and<br />fragile the elaborate 'chip protection' is that Epson has put in place.<br /><br />Ink economy - the key words is "up to"  xxx number of pages.<br /><br />So far I have printed about 250 B&W sheets and at this rate I should be<br />able to print about 718 sheets on one cartridge.  Mainly pure text and<br />information from the web - nearly all B&W.<br />I have printed exactly 47 color sheets including test pages for my setup.<br />I found Normal Mode to be adequate and most economical for me.<br />Based on this I project that I will get a maximum of 108 yellow, 90 blue<br />and only 61 Magenta pages before the ink cartridge needs replacement.<br /><br />But wait there is more!  The Maintenance Box also has a short service life<br />(part # T6710) and is very difficult to find anywhere.  It is fully<br />'chipped and protected' and can not just be emptied by the user.  I you<br />can find this little monster anywhere then it costs between $15 and $26<br />plus freight, tax and handling.  Based on the above use this far I will<br />get no more than 1500 Black and White sheets.<br /><br />So it looks like I will get a total of say 75 sheets (8.5x11) of color<br />printing for each set of three color cartridges.  If I bought the extra<br />large carts then perhaps twice the amount for B&W and I understand the<br />color carts are half that size - unable to find actual ink volume date<br />anywhere.  So one is looking at about $1 per page not counting the Black<br />ink or the Maintenance box.  In any case there is nothing to write home<br />about.<br /><br />I do like the menus and software provided with all the adjustments that my<br />old Canon never had.

Canon has "rigged" the printer in a way that if one cartridge is out of ink (any one of 7 cartridges), the whole printer, scanner, copier is out of commission.  It is also set up, at least on Mac, to be practically impossible to print black and white only.  The effect is you use a LOT of ink and are often replacing small cartridges at high prices.  I won't purchase another Canon again.  There is no reason to disable a scanner because I'm missing a printer cartridge.  And it isn't sloppy design, it is calculated design.;;1.0;;July 20, 2012;;8;;26;;0.307692

They offer a large bundle of ink cartriges at a low price 12 colored (4 of each), in addition offer 5 black cartriges for another low price. Lots of ink for a low price. Now here's the problem, the ink that they offer is LC-61, but the printer takes LC-71. The LC-61 cartriges they are selling are not compatible with the printer that they are selling. I used the cartriges that were in the printer box first, which are fine. Nearly 2 months later my black ink runs out, which is when I find out that the extra cartriges that was purchased will not fit the printer. Amazon was reluctant to take back the wrong cartriges due to it being past the return date. Amazon is mismatching inks and printers. In a way they are misleading customers into purchasing ink that does not match the printer that they are purchasing in the same order.;;2.0;;February 14, 2012;;9;;13;;0.692308

BUT-  when I upgraded to windows 7 - No was driver available.  Not till June.  So, although my business has invested over $1000 in toner over the years,  plus cost of the printer- they feel no need to support me.  It is unrealistic to ask a person to stop all printing at their business for 6 months.  Are they trying to force me to throw out my printer and toner and buy a new one?<br /><br />I am losing time and money, because I chose their product.<br /><br />I've been very loyal to them, but they have no loyalty to me.<br /><br />Beware!;;1.0;;May 4, 2010;;7;;27;;0.259259

It seemed the answer to my needs, so I ordered it. Upon opening the box I became suspicious when I saw the multiple instruction manuals. Why so many? There are so many because this machine is a return to the 1980's, a time when the engineering was primative and the instructions booklets were long, written oringinally in some language other than English, and then badly translated into English.<br /><br />The multiple booklets are needed because you will find yourself doing the final assembly tasks that are now usually done in the factory. The instructions are mostly in small, poorly-printed diagrams. Place a thumb wrong in opening an ink supply, you are warned, and you will ruin it. Do it right the first time or buy a new one.<br /><br />Have a Mac? How about a booklet that has 11 pages (or parts of pages) that tell you how to install the software? I guess that Canon cannot afford the engineering to speed or ease the process.<br /><br />Well, if you long for the old days and were really good with Lego when you were little, buy this machine.;;1.0;;October 17, 2009;;28;;125;;0.224

It has an Ethernet card, it has a USB port, it has wireless connectivity and it would be penalized 15 yards every time I attempted to do a software scan or fax.  Since my scanning needs are about 50/50 with my printing needs, there is a 15 yard gain, every time I print, because the prints on this printer are amazing!  I love the prints!  We love the prints. I can print every time!  But blast that non-communicating document management system!  Did they even try and QA the thing?  Did they test it in a bubble?  If you need a network scanner and or fax, forget this one.  If you need an OUTSTANDING PRINTER, then buy the NON MFC version and save yourself some money and aggravation.  If you already bought it, and you don't have any troubles with your network scanning and faxing, then you need to check your network, because if you are wide open to this very chatty printer, then you obviously have a gaping hole in your firewall.  It seems that somewhere in Japan, someone needs an update on this printer, like 50,000 times a day. Seriously, the printer is not botted, brand new off the shelf, and it needs to tell someone in Japan, everything!  You can block this, of course, but then whoever it is that's talking to my beloved Brother MFC, gets ticked and locks you down from getting SW updates, they tell the remote configuration utility to refuse to access setup, and the whole printer complains it can't see when you select the Scan or Fax button on the control panel.  On top of that, we get this unrecoverable sleep mode.  When this printer goes to sleep, it can't wake up unless (and Wireshark is great for showing this, so is OPEN DNS) the printer-lord in Japan tells it to.  You can press that evil scan button all day long, but it isn't going to obey.  So the game is now tied, at zero, no team is able to move the ball, and we are left with a great scanner that wont scan, a fax that wont fax, and a printer who just longs to print great looking pages.  The last thing that bugs me, is this.  If you have photo-shop and you want to scan, the scanner utility is great.  But there's no option to trouble shoot the network aspect.  The scanner utility shows you the printer is discoverable on the network, it shows you a cool picture that leads you down the path towards hoping you can scan, but get ready for a 10 to 15 minute wait until you can actually see a message (which says nothing but placating techno gibberish about how you failed to get a first down and you have to punt), and then it still does not tell you what the problem actually is.  Kind of like the fat guy on Jurassic Park, wagging his finger mockingly, telling you that you can't do what ever it is you want to do, even though you own the system - until you say the magic word.  I am sorry, but the game is over, no score, no yards gained, no clear winner, only anger and joy, anger and joy.;;3.0;;May 8, 2012;;11;;22;;0.5
